The building in Hammersmith's Margravine Cemetery, London created in 1869, has been given Grade II listing. Families unable to immediately pay for a burial previously used to keep dead relatives in their homes, contributing to cholera outbreaks in the city. Historic England said the store was "ghoulish and absolutely fascinating". Director of listing Roger Bowdler said many had to keep their relatives' bodies in their small cramped homes during the early 1800s, "so you've got the living cheek-by-jowl with the dead". The small octagonal building used for holding the dead before funerals, was an example of the facilities proposed by Edwin Chadwick, secretary to the Poor Law Commission, who led a review of sanitary conditions. The store also addressed people's fears that their relatives would be buried before they had actually died. The use of reception houses was phased out with the introduction of undertakers in the 1880s and the building is the sole survivor of its kind in the capital, according to Historic England. Heritage minister Tracey Crouch said the building was "an important part of London's history" as it "gives us a glimpse into how cholera outbreaks changed Victorian attitudes to burials and public health." Receiving the listing could help secure funding for any conservation work on the reception house.	A cemetery's unique Victorian reception house which stored coffins to stop poor people keeping bodies in their homes, has been given protected status.
The boat is understood to have capsized in the Durris area, at Craiglug. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service initially said one of the three - believed to be teenagers - made it ashore, and efforts were being made to reach the other two who were stranded on an island in the river. They were later rescued by boat. The alert was raised shortly after 13:45.	Three girls who sparked a rescue effort in the River Dee in Aberdeenshire after reports of a boat getting into difficulties are all safe and well.
Damage to to overhead wires meant the line is blocked north of Morpeth. Virgin East Coast, Northern Rail, and Cross Country services were affected, with reports of large queues at Newcastle Central Station. Buses were organised to take passengers between Newcastle and Edinburgh, with people advised to avoid travelling if possible. Services resumed late on Friday.	Rail passengers travelling between Newcastle and Scotland faced severe disruption on Friday.
Bates, who has been Tigers promoter for three years, has taken full control of the Lions and will work alongside co-promoter David Darcy. Bates said: "We're only weeks away from the new season and so our main priority is to quickly form a team. "We have opened talks with several riders and should be in a position to announce the first signings any day." Lions endured a miserable season last time out and finished bottom of the Elite League table. But Bates said he hoped the club's financial difficulties were a thing of the past. "I am aware that Leicester went through a difficult trading period last season," he said. "And I will be doing everything possible to ensure that the club is placed on a sound financial footing that secures the future of Leicester Speedway for years to come."	Leicester Lions Speedway have been bought by Sheffield Tigers promoter Damien Bates.
Thomas Baker, known as Tommy, was found badly injured at Stanley Meat Market in the Old Swan area of Liverpool on 27 January. The 44-year-old, from Everton, had been shot in the head and chest. He died later in hospital. The three Liverpool men arrested - two aged 29 and the other 32 - remain in police custody for questioning. Merseyside Police said Mr Baker had left Phoenix Gym at the market shortly before he was shot while getting into his car. Detectives believe those involved in the shooting had been waiting outside the gym for about an hour. Det Ch Insp Bev Hyland said officers were still searching for a silver VW polo, which "left the scene at speed" and travelled along a number of roads including Balmoral Road, Molyneux Road and Queens Road. She added that a number of people captured on CCTV near the meat market had yet to come forward and while "they may not think what they saw would be of any significance, they could have information which is key to our inquiries".	Three men have been arrested on suspicion of murder over the shooting of a man at a meat market.
Air accident investigators have been briefing families ahead of official publication of their final report. The police helicopter crashed onto the busy Clutha bar on 29 November 2013. An earlier interim report said the engines had shut down even though there was fuel in the reserve tank. Some relatives said the briefing had left many questions unanswered, and underlined the need for black box flight recorders to be fitted in all passenger-carrying aircraft. Following the meeting with the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) in Glasgow on Wednesday evening, Ian O'Prey whose son Mark died in the bar, said there was "no resolution" to the tragedy. Mr O'Prey said there had been a few "heated moments" during the meeting but it "all calmed down". He said: "I don't think I'm any further forward. The AAIB - they think it was switches that were left on - or weren't left on. "My main question to them was flight recorders -  if they had flight recorders, it would have taken us a fraction of the time it has taken us. "Personally I feel calmer than I did before I went in. I can't keep shouting at the moon for the rest of my life although I feel I want to." Investigators are due to hold another closed meeting with bereaved relatives on Thursday and have asked families not to discuss the detailed findings until the report's official publication on Friday. John McGarrigle, whose father John died, said he felt "let down" despite optimism ahead of AAIB meeting. Mr McGarrigle said: "All tonight has done for me is raise loads more questions. My head is scrambled, I'm that angry. "Flight data recorders should be installed in every passenger-carrying aircraft - simple as. If we had that, we would know a lot more. "We wouldn't know the full cause, but we would know half of the reasons at least and we would have learned from it." Jim Morris, an aviation law expert with Irwin Mitchell Solicitors, also said the lack of a "black box" had hampered the investigation. He said: "Unfortunately, in my view, due to a lack of a requirement to fit a black box flight data recorder, we have almost more unanswered questions." Mr Morris added: "We still do not know why fuel did not reach the engines. "The report goes into significant detail in its analysis but it is clear from what is said in the report that they can't answer all the questions." Anne-Marie Kennedy, who was working behind the bar and was trapped in the wreckage, said she was "satisfied" with how the briefing went. She said: "It's shown me that they should have black boxes for defo, it's shown me the need for other regulation, but other than that nothing. "Until I speak to my legal team I can only speculate. "I'm satisfied with the way the night went. I believe that the AAIB has done everything in their power. "The guy explained the investigation, the complexity and the length of time. They did all they could." Find out more The Police Scotland Eurocopter EC 135, operated by Bond Air Services, came down on to the roof of the Clutha Bar at about 22:25 on a busy Friday night. The helicopter crew who were killed were pilot David Traill, PC Tony Collins and PC Kirsty Nelis. The seven customers in the Clutha who died were John McGarrigle, Mark O'Prey, Gary Arthur, Colin Gibson, Robert Jenkins, Samuel McGhee and Joe Cusker. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) issued an interim report last year which said that both engines on the helicopter "flamed out" due to a fuel supply problem. The report, however, did not set out the cause.	Relatives of the 10 people who died in the Clutha helicopter tragedy in Glasgow have been told fuel switches were in the off position when they should have been on.

Joshua, 27, is undefeated in 18 fights since turning professional, while 41-year-old Klitschko had his first defeat in 11 years against Tyson Fury in 2015. "Klitschko doesn't have the legs, the power that he used to," said Lewis. "He has a chink in his armour after getting beat by Tyson Fury. Anthony Joshua is now taking that challenge, going after the man." Joshua himself asked the question in the build-up to Saturday's fight of whether "Father Time has caught up with the former champ?". But Lewis, who like Joshua won a super-heavyweight Olympic gold medal, says the Ukrainian's age is not the only reason he fancies the British fighter's chances. "Now is the perfect time for him," the 51-year-old told BBC Radio 5 live. "I believe Joshua is more focused, more aimed. Does he want to be undisputed champion? Absolutely."

John Fell, from Cumbria, is confident his 1.5kg ostrich egg covered in meat will earn him a Guinness World Record. The existing record was set in 2008 in a London hotel when the snack produced weighed in at just over 6kg. Mr Fell, Calderbridge, used 10kg of sausage meat and 1.5kg of breadcrumbs - about five loaves' worth. It took him seven hours to cook his giant snack - the Ostrich egg was boiled for two hours and it took another three hours to cook the meat. His attempt in a chip shop in Leith, Edinburgh, was filmed by Scottish television and watched by an official record monitor, with each stage carefully documented. Mr Fell said: "I am a judge in a competition entitled the Egg Awards 2014 - we support local egg producers, and encourage people not to buy supermarket eggs. "This is to promote local eggs. But ironically the egg used had to come from Mexico as I couldn't track any down in England. "About 60 people watched me cook the egg and helped us eat it - it was nice - the meat was based on an old Cumberland sausage recipe." He now has to wait six weeks to find out whether his enormous savoury delicacy will be officially classed as a record-breaker.	A chef is hoping he has cooked the world's biggest scotch egg - a whopping 11kg (24lbs) - which took three hours to deep fry.
The hosts needed only 66 minutes and 82 deliveries to take the remaining seven England wickets in Centurion. Kagiso Rabada, 20, became the youngest South Africa bowler to take 10 wickets in a match, and finished with 6-32 to add to his first-innings 7-112. Morne Morkel claimed 3-36, with James Taylor's 24 the highest score for England, who won the series 2-1. England, beaten 2-0 by Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates earlier this winter, next play Test cricket against Sri Lanka at Headingley on 19 May. Having reduced England to 52-3 on Monday, South Africa hurried through the rest of the order thanks to some splendid bowling on a wearing surface. In all, England lost their last seven wickets for 43 runs in 10.5 overs as any hopes of batting out the day vanished amid a flurry of reckless strokes. Here's how the collapse unfolded: Fittingly, the lithe paceman, in only his sixth Test match, took the final three wickets as England were skittled out before a drinks break was required. That gave Rabada match figures of 13-144, the best by a South Africa bowler on home soil and the second-best in their history. The man of the match, who was also the leading wicket-taker in the series, said: "It was a bit up and down so the key was the hit the deck and bowl the ball in a good area and I believed you'd get your rewards." Former England captain Michael Vaughan told BBC Test Match Special: "England have batted on a pitch with a bit of spice and they have shown no heart. "It's almost like the white towel has been thrown in. It was a really feeble way to finish the tour." Former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott: "Get your head down and save the match. But there was no effort this morning. "Coming out and playing shots, does that excuse you after winning the series? No. There's no excuse for that. You have to be professional. That's not good enough." Media playback is not supported on this device England captain Alastair Cook: "We always try and play positively but on certain wickets you have to play a different way. We didn't get the balance right. "Whether that's the end of the tour mentality I don't know. If you'd offered me 2-1 before the series I would have snapped your hand off." England face a South Africa Invitation XI in a warm-up game on Saturday before a five-match one-day series against South Africa gets under way on 3 February. Proteas pace bowler Dale Steyn will play no part in the ODI campaign as he continues his recovery from the shoulder injury which kept him out of the third and fourth Tests.

It comes after paediatric pathologist Dr Caroline Gannon resigned over interventions by Mr Larkin on abortion laws surrounding fatal foetal abnormality. The Foyle MLA said the attorney general was supposed to be above politics. "Mr Larkin's entitled to his own conscientious beliefs, religious and otherwise," Mr McCann said. "Mr Larkin is not entitled, it seems to me, to go around the world, into European courts and so forth, expressing points of view which reflect his own moral religious beliefs, but which cannot be represented as the beliefs of the majority of people in the north. "I think he's gone too far so I think he should leave." Dr Gannon investigated the deaths of babies including those in the womb or stillbirths. She said the recent interventions by Mr Larkin made her position untenable. She said the final straw for her was having to advise a couple to use a picnic cooler bag to return their baby's remains to NI following an abortion in England. A family can have a post-mortem examination carried out in England - but they are difficult to arrange. Dr Gannon's resignation leaves Northern Ireland with only one paediatric pathologist. Both the attorney general and the Department of Justice are involved in legal proceedings which are looking at the current law. Peter Lynas, from the Evangelical Alliance, said he could see no reason why Mr Larkin has been singled out. "I don't hear any call for the justice minister to stand down," he said. "John is upholding the law as he is supposed to do, so I'm not quite sure what the series of offences are. How has he overstepped the mark? "The attorney general's role is to uphold the law as it is and he is joined in that appeal by the Department of Justice."

The technology is being trialled at New York Red Bulls' stadium, with a video assistant referee taking 30 seconds to review a challenge in a Red Bulls II match against Orlando City. A screen at the side of the pitch helped the officials decide to dismiss Orlando's Conor Donovan for denying a goalscoring opportunity just outside the penalty area. Video replays will be used to advise on "game-changing" decisions in United Soccer League matches - the third tier of US football. That includes goals, red cards, mistaken identities and penalties. They will also be tested in six other countries in the next two years, including Germany and Italy. The game's lawmakers, the International Football Association Board (IFAB), wants to decide by 2019 on whether to introduce video replays across the sport.	Video replays were used for the first time to send off a player for a professional foul in a Major League Soccer reserve match.
Media playback is not supported on this device Michael Allen's try helped a sluggish Ulster into a 10-0 lead at the break but the hosts sparkled in the final 20 minutes as they scored five tries. A penalty try was reward for constant pressure and Stuart McCloskey went over before Ireland wing Craig Gilroy sprinted in for the bonus point. Andrew Warwick touched down before Gilroy completed the rout. Ulster edged out Treviso in Italy last month and they were expected to brush aside the visitors on home soil. However, Treviso applied the early pressure as Ulster made a lacklustre start to the game. The Italians failed to capitalise on their territorial dominance and Ulster finally sparked into life, with a 19th-minute penalty from Ruan Pienaar getting the hosts on the scoreboard. The opening try came seven minutes later, with Allen jinking inside and darting through before Pienaar added the extras. Ulster were now the team in control although handling errors and stubborn Treviso defending kept the gap at 10. Pienaar had the chance to extend Ulster's advantage with the final action of the half, but the scrum-half saw his penalty strike the upright. Ulster pinned Treviso back on the restart but rustiness from the three-week break was evident as unforced errors denied them a try. Lewis Stevenson rumbled over from close range but it was ruled out for offside, although Treviso captain Antonio Pavenello was sinbinned for a deliberate knock-down in the move. His second-row replacement Tomas Vallejos was also yellow-carded as Treviso infringements mounted. The pressure finally told courtesy of a converted penalty try on the hour mark and Ulster could now target the bonus point. Treviso finally registered a score with Joe Carlisle's penalty before Ulster added a third converted try as replacement McCloskey muscled over in the corner on 68 minutes. It was quickly followed by the bonus-point try, with Gilroy finishing off a passing move on his 100th appearance for Ulster although Pienaar missed the conversion. Treviso were visibly wilting and Ulster were taking full advantage as replacement Warwick charged over before Gilroy intercepted a pass before sprinting in for his second try. Pienaar converted both tries as Ulster came away with a victory which leaves them level on points with the pacesetting Ospreys. Ulster: Ludik, Gilroy, Cave, L. Marshall, Allen, Humphreys, Pienaar, Black, Herring, Herbst, Stevenson, van der Merwe, Wilson, McComish, Williams. Replacements: McCloskey for L. Marshall (54), Warwick for Black (67), B.

Former Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC) chief executive Nazir Afzal was advised against doing so by the organisation's board. This was because of potentially controversial policing issues that could have been raised on the show. But Mr Afzal stepped down and appeared on the programme on 25 May. The APCC said: "Nazir told the board that he intended to go on Question Time to discuss the recent events in Manchester. "The board, made up of all parties, advised that it would be inappropriate for him to do so, given the number of contentious issues relating to policing which could be raised especially in discussion with politicians who were appearing and during purdah. "He resigned from his post in order to make this appearance. We thank him for his service during his year at the APCC." Mr Afzal joined the APCC last year. The association said Mr Afzal signed a contract confirming that he would not do any media without the consent of the board. This was essential because the APCC was apolitical and the role of the chief executive was politically restricted, it said. Mr Afzal tweeted: "Given media calls I confirm that I've resigned as Chief Executive of country's police & crime commissioners. I'm not saying anything publicly."

The Welsh government said Jobs Growth Wales had not been scrapped and placements would continue. Last year, the scheme's budget was cut in order for cash to go to the NHS. But the Labour-run Welsh government said this had not affected the scheme which had hit all its targets. Criticism has followed the closure. Chancellor George Osborne from the Conservative party, said the decision to temporarily close the scheme pointed to "confusion" within labour after party leader Ed Miliband had said he wanted the programme to be rolled out across the country. Campaigning in the Vale of Glamorgan, Mr Osborne said: "I remember the Labour party urging me to take this scheme across the whole of the UK.  Now they are cutting it in Wales. "What it points to is real confusion in the Labour party. They don't really have a clear plan for Wales and I think Wales as a result would suffer with lost jobs, lost investment." Other parties also criticised the decision with Jenny Willott, for the Liberal Democrats, saying Jobs Growth Wales had been "ineffective". "However, for the Welsh Labour Government to allow this scheme to expire without replacing it is staggering," she said. And Ian Johnson, a Plaid Cymru election candidate, added: "Earlier this year, Ed Miliband said how great the scheme was. "Today, he has been embarrassed by his only government in the UK, who have fundamentally undermined his election pledge to young people." Meanwhile, UKIP's leader in Wales Nathan Gill called on ministers to "focus on creating the right conditions for existing businesses to expand and for new businesses to start". "The only way we will ever truly achieve this is to withdraw from the European Union, which spends each day dreaming up new ways of stifling innovation and creativity in the form of regulations and directives," he said. But the Welsh government said it was aiming to launch a new Jobs Growth Wales programme in May saying it has made a "significant contribution to reducing youth unemployment right across Wales". "The original programme was designed to create and fill 12,000 jobs and to date it has helped create over 17,000 job opportunities and fill almost 15,000 of these vacancies for young people aged 16-24," a spokesperson said. "The European Social Fund budget for the 2007-2013 programme came to an end on 31 March and we have already begun work on the successor programme. "Subject to approval within the new European Social Fund for 2014-2020 we are aiming to launch the new Jobs Growth Wales programme in the first quarter of this financial year." The thrust of the criticism here is that if Jobs Growth Wales is so important to the Welsh economy then how come it has been allowed to come to a halt, albeit temporarily, and how come funding has been reduced? The opposition parties have seized on developments partly because barely a week goes by without a member of the Welsh government trumpeting the success of its back-to-work scheme. The Welsh government insists it is not being scrapped and has responded to criticism over continuity by pointing to the fact that anyone about to begin or in the middle of a six-month placement will not be affected. It says officials have already worked up a new scheme and are awaiting approval from the EU within a month.	A flagship Welsh government youth job creation scheme has been temporarily closed while approval for a new one is awaited from the EU.
Owen and Karl Oyston are seeking Â£150,000 damages from the Back Henry Street website. Papers were served on Thursday over six alleged defamatory comments which were made in 2014. A club spokesman confirmed the legal action but said it would not be commenting further. A notice published on the fans' website stated: "To clear up any rumours, on Thursday 5 February 2015, Back Henry Street was served papers from the court, relating to the Oystons' and Blackpool Football Club's intent to seek damages for six allegedly defamatory comments made on the site in 2014, limited collectively at Â£150,000. "For obvious reasons, we can not go into any more detail at this time. Thank you for your continued support." The forum has appealed to fans of the Championship side to help in its legal fight. One of its moderators posted a message saying: "A football club exists and prospers due to the support of its fan-base and Back Henry Street will forever champion the freedom of thought and expression in discussion of Blackpool Football Club. "It is vital we ensure that we, the real Blackpool fans, will always have this forum to discuss our club." Last week dozens of Blackpool fans attended a court hearing in Manchester for a separate legal action brought by the Oystons against a fan. David Ragozzino, 32, was given 21 days to respond to a claim for damages from the club. On 30 January another fan, Stephen Sharpe, apologised to the Oystons over his online comments, withdrawing his posts after accepting they were "false, defamatory and, in some cases, threatening". The club also has legal action pending against the former chair of the Blackpool Supporters' Trust, Tim Fielding.	The owners of Blackpool Football Club are suing a web forum for libel in the latest of a series of actions against fans making derogatory comments online.
South Wales Fire and Rescue said its crews tackled the blaze throughout the night at the former White Hart Pub on Newbridge Road, Pontllanfraith. They were called to the premises in the Sirhowy Valley village at about 19:30 GMT on Saturday. Fire crews were back at the scene on Sunday checking for any hotspots after extinguishing the flames. A joint investigation with police is now under way to establish how the fire was started, and who was responsible.

They say the parts, possibly from a Buk surface-to-air system, are "of particular interest" and could help show who was behind the crash. But they say they have not proved their "causal connection" with the crash. MH17 crashed on land held by Russian-backed rebels in July 2014, killing all 298 on board. There were 283 passengers, including 80 children, and 15 crew members on the Malaysian Airlines airliner. About two-thirds of those who died were Dutch nationals, with dozens of Malaysians and Australians among the rest. Ukraine and many Western countries have accused pro-Russian rebels of shooting down the plane, saying they could have used a Buk missile system supplied by Russia. Russia and the rebels deny any responsibility and say the Ukrainian military was to blame. How a missile could have brought down MH17 MH17: What we know A tale of two sisters and flight MH17 Air disaster that touched a nation The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) said in a joint statement with the Dutch Safety Board that the parts had been "secured during a previous recovery mission in eastern Ukraine". "The parts are of particular interest to the criminal investigation as they can possibly provide more information about who was involved in the crash of MH17. For that reason the JIT further investigates the origin of these parts," the statement said. Fred Westerbeke, a spokesman for the Dutch Prosecutor's Office, said that seven fragments had been found which were definitely not part of the aircraft, and further investigations had shown that they were probably from a missile system. "We are going to need more investigation to really find out what exactly this is and if it is part of a possible system that took down MH17," he added. "If we can establish that, then we can say that it is a breakthrough." The Dutch safety board is characteristically cautious. For now it is insisting that no causal connection can be established between the discovered parts and the crash. The aircraft is widely believed to have been downed by a surface-to-air missile. Indeed the investigators' preliminary report - released last September - noted that the damage to the aircraft's fuselage and cockpit indicated impacts from a large number of high-energy objects from outside the aircraft; consistent with an engagement by a Buk-type missile. The crucial question remains who fired the weapon - Russian-backed separatists or even the Russian military itself? The Ukrainians also operate a variant of the Buk system. The missile parts could be a help here but satellite intelligence may provide more of the picture. Independent investigators have already established a video trail which appears to place a Buk launcher in the crash area on the day in question. The investigators would now enlist the help of weapons experts and forensic specialists to examine the parts, the statement added. The JIT comprises representatives of the Netherlands, Ukraine, Belgium, Malaysia and Australia. They are meeting in The Hague to discuss a draft report on the causes of the crash, the final version of which is expected to be published by the Dutch Safety Board in October. The statement comes two weeks after Russia vetoed a draft resolution to set up an international tribunal into the disaster, triggering widespread outrage. Moscow described the Malaysian initiative as "premature" and "counterproductive". The Boeing 777 was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was brought down on 17 July last year in Donetsk region.	Fragments of a suspected Russian missile system have been found at the Flight MH17 crash site in Ukraine, investigators in the Netherlands say.
The Alabama Securities Commission led the investigation, which helps prevent financial fraud against the elderly. After an agent interviewed Lee, the commission's head said he was satisfied she wanted a second book published. The new work - Go Set a Watchman - will be the 88-year-old American author's first release since the 1960s. The surprise move prompted some suggestions Lee was manipulated into publishing the decades-old manuscript, which was discovered by her lawyer in the author's possessions last year. "We closed the file. Let's just say that she was able to answer questions we asked to our satisfaction from our point of view,'' said Joseph Borg, Alabama Securities Commission director. The New York Times reported that the investigation was sparked by requests from a doctor that the state investigate whether Lee was capable to have consented to the release of the work. Lee herself was "extremely hurt" by allegations she was manipulated, her lawyer Tonja Carter said. To Kill a Mockingbird was published in July 1960 and has sold more than 40 million copies around the world. Go Set a Watchman was written before To Kill A Mockingbird, and features many of the same characters, with an adult Scout Finch returning to her native Alabama from New York to visit her father.	US investigators have closed an inquiry into whether To Kill A Mockingbird author Harper Lee was pressured into publishing a sequel.
John Ridsdel, 68, was taken from a tourist resort along with three others by the Abu Sayyaf group in September last year. The group had threatened to kill a male hostage on April 25 if a ransom was not paid. Confirming the death, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called it "an act of cold-blooded murder". Mr Ridsdel was kidnapped from a marina near the city of Davao along with another Canadian, Robert Hall, Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad and a Philippine woman, Mr Hall's girlfriend Marites Flor. They were taken 500km (300 miles) to the island of Jolo. Abu Sayyaf released a video of the group in November, in which they demanded $80m (Â£55m) for their release. Mr Ridsdel later warned that he was due to be killed if no ransom was paid. Several hours after the deadline, a severed head was found in a street on Jolo. The Philippine authorities said it belonged to a foreign man but it has not yet been formally identified. "It's hard," a friend of Mr Ridsdel, Bob Rae, told CBC News. "It's just very hard. I've been involved behind the scenes for the last six months trying to find a solution and it's been very painful." A former mining executive, Mr Ridsdel is described by Canadian media as semi-retired. He also worked as a journalist. Offering his condolences, Mr Trudeau gave few details, saying he would not compromise the safety of the other captives. Abu Sayyaf was set up in the 1990s and received funding from al-Qaeda.  It is fighting for an independent Islamic province in the Philippines. Several of its factions have declared their allegiance to the militant group Islamic State. Abu Sayyaf is also holding several other foreigners. Eighteen Philippine soldiers were killed in clashes with the militants on Basilan island near Jolo island earlier this month.	A Canadian man held captive by Islamist militants for months in the Philippines has been killed.
The fund was set up by Mr Najib in 2009 with the stated aim of boosting the Malaysian economy. But FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said evidence showed it had defrauded Malaysians "on an enormous scale". On Wednesday, US authorities moved to seize more than $1bn (Â£761m) in assets related to the fund. Mr Najib is not named in the US papers and has consistently denied wrongdoing. But he is identifiable as "Malaysian Official 1", whose account allegedly received millions in funds originating from 1MDB. The $1bn the US hopes to seize would make up only a proportion of the more than $3.5bn (Â£2.6bn) allegedly diverted. Source: US Department of Justice Mr Najib was officially cleared of criminality by the Malaysian attorney general earlier this year. He had dismissed the previous attorney general after he repeatedly criticised the prime minister's handling of the case. The current attorney general, Mohamed Apandi, said on Thursday that there was no evidence funds were misappropriated from 1MDB. Speaking on Thursday, Mr Najib stressed the US case was a "civil, not a criminal, procedure" and that "we don't want to come to any conclusions until that process [the investigation] is done". "I want to say categorically that we are serious about good governance," he said, adding that he would "fully co-operate" with the investigation. Despite denying any wrongdoing, the prime minister is now facing renewed calls to answer the accusations and stand down. Former premier and long-time Najib foe Mahathir Mohamad said there "can be no doubt" that Mr Najib was responsible for 1MDB's finances. He said Malaysians should stage street protests against Mr Najib, as they have in the past, and push for a referendum on his leadership. Parliamentary opposition leader Wan Azizah Wan Ismail said he should go on leave "so as not to create the perception of abuse of power" or hinder this "very important" investigation. When I spoke to the fund's CEO, Arul Kanda, in October last year, he told me "the value of assets outweigh the value of debt". But 1MDB had to sell some of its most prized assets in order to realise this value, and as one Malaysian opposition leader put it to me at the time, any business that has to do that isn't a successful business. 1MDB's financial mismanagement and the allegations of misconduct by the prime minister has raised concern amongst the foreign investment community that Malaysia's economy is in for a rough ride. But there are bigger worries than just the financial performance of 1MDB. At the heart of it is the suggestion that Malaysia's public money has been stolen and used for personal gain. Read more from Karishma 1MDB said in a statement last year that it had never given money to the prime minister and called the claims "unsubstantiated". Meanwhile Singapore fraud investigators said on Thursday they had seized more than $175m in assets connected to 1MDB and found several major banks, including Standard Chartered, had showed "weaknesses in the processes for accepting clients and monitoring transactions". Also on Thursday, the Swiss authorities said they had seized three valuable paintings linked to the investigation - one Van Gogh painting and two Monet paintings, following a US request.	Malaysian PM Najib Razak is facing pressure internationally and at home amid US allegations of massive fraud at state investment fund 1MDB.
BP described the withdrawal as a "precautionary measure", adding that it would monitor the security situation. The Foreign Office withdrew British embassy staff from the capital, Tripoli, last week. Gunmen have besieged the justice and foreign ministries recently, demanding that Gaddafi-era officials be expelled. The gunmen blocked the buildings two weeks ago, parking pick-up trucks with anti-aircraft guns outside. The siege was lifted by Sunday and employees at both ministries were back at work. Parliament passed a law last week barring Gaddafi-era officials from political office. BP said in a statement: "Following FCO advice given to us by the British Embassy in Tripoli, and purely as a precautionary measure, we have brought non-essential overseas staff out of Libya for the time being in a phased reduction of numbers. "Our Libyan staff remain and the office continues to operate. Fewer than a dozen people are affected. "We will continue to monitor the security situation and move people back in to Libya when it is considered safe to do so." On Friday, the Foreign Office said some embassy staff in Libya had been withdrawn in response to "ongoing political uncertainty". It said it was temporarily withdrawing a "small number" who work with Libyan ministries, while the UK embassy remains "open as usual", including for consular and visa services. The Foreign Office currently advises against all but essential travel to Tripoli and against all travel to other parts of Libya, such as the eastern city of Benghazi.	Oil giant BP has withdrawn some non-essential staff from operations in Libya following UK government advice about uncertainty in the country.

Andrew Salina was found seriously injured at his home in Roystonhill at about 03:30 after emergency services were alerted to a disturbance. He was subsequently pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. DCI Paul Livingstone said it appeared a weapon had been used in the "violent incident" and appealed for information about three men seen in the area. Detectives from Police Scotland's major investigation team are treating the death as a murder. Officers were conducting door-to-door inquiries, with specialist forensic teams at the scene and additional patrols in the area. Mr Livingstone said: "I am asking for the assistance of the local community to come forward with any information you may have. It is possible you witnessed or heard a disturbance in Roystonhill at the junction with Millburn Street at around 03:30 hours. "We also understand that three men were seen entering the area in a small light coloured car and were seen leaving the area in the same vehicle following the alleged incident. "I want to reassure the local community that we are doing everything we can to find out what took place and determine who is responsible for the death of Andrew Salina. Additional officers are patrolling Royston and I would ask anyone with any information or concerns to speak with them today."	Police have launched a murder inquiry after a 51-year-old man was killed in his home in Glasgow.
Goalkeeper Manny Agboola, 18, will be on the bench after being recalled from a loan spell at North Leigh. Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez is likely to make changes again, as he did in the last round against Birmingham. Striker Aleksandar Mitrovic (knee) and midfielder Jack Colback (illness) could return. Oxford United manager Michael Appleton told BBC Radio Oxford: "If we beat Newcastle, it would probably be as big a win for me as I've ever had as a manager. "I remember being manager of Blackburn in the FA Cup fifth round and we went to Arsenal and became the only team to beat them in a FA Cup tie at the Emirates. "That was some achievement as we probably spent about 80% of the game on the back foot. But for me, if Newcastle were in the Premier League right now, they'd be a top-10 team. "They've got a fantastic manager, are a great club with a winning mentality and with fantastic support behind them." Newcastle United boss Rafael Benitez: "We knew we had to make changes [in the last round against Birmingham] because we have so many games. "It is important to win, but using the squad and not taking too many risks with players was important. This competition is always difficult, but we will try to go through. "When you play against any team at this stage, especially away from home, it gives them extra motivation."	Oxford United could hand a debut to striker Toni Martinez after his loan move from West Ham, but forward Chris Maguire (thigh) faces a fitness test.
Mr Kim was speaking after twin tests on Wednesday of the Hwasong-10 missile, known internationally as the Musudan. The US and South Korea say the first test failed, but the second travelled about 400km (250 miles) and reached an altitude of 1,000km. The UN Security Council expressed its opposition after an emergency meeting. Alexis Lamek, France's deputy UN ambassador, said all 15 members had "expressed a strong concern as well as their opposition to these launches," Reuters reports. A spokesman for Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the tests were "a deliberate and very grave violation" of North Korea's international obligations. Existing UN resolutions, brought in because of its continuing nuclear and conventional weapons programme, ban North Korea from using ballistic missile technology. The Musudan, named by outsiders after a North Korean village, is believed by outside observers to have range of up to 4,000km (2,500 miles). That is far enough to reach the US territory and military bases in Guam, though it has never been fully flight tested. Four tests in recent months have ended in failure. The first missile launched from the North's eastern coast on Wednesday is believed to have flown about 150km before landing in the sea. But a second one launched hours later travelled at least 400km and reached a height of 1,000km. North Korea's KCNA state news agency said it had been successfully conducted, without endangering surrounding countries. Mr Kim, who as always was said to have supervised the test, said it had been "a great event". "We have the sure capability to attack in an overall and practical way the Americans in the Pacific operation theatre," he said. South Korea has not officially said whether it is considering it a successful launch. But an analyst at the state-funded Science and Technology Policy Institute said it had to be seen as such. "No other missiles fired by North Korea have ever flown that high," Lee Choon-geun was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. Japan said the launch showed "a certain level of capability" and could lead to a further strengthening of North Korea's ballistic missile capabilities that could cover Japanese territory. US Defense Secretary Ash Carter acknowledged that one of the missiles "flew for a long time". In addition to a flurry of missile tests, North Korea conducted its fourth test of a nuclear weapon in January. But despite its claims, it remains unclear whether it has the ability to make a nuclear device small enough to mount onto a warhead.	North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has said his country's latest missile tests show it has "the sure capability to attack US interests".
Media playback is not supported on this device Wales go into Saturday's semi-final against France with Gatland claiming: "We are not whiter than white." Media playback is not supported on this device While England were damaged by stories of late-night revelry, the Welsh have been portrayed as virtually teetotal. "A lot [has been] made of us being like monks and that there has been an alcohol ban. That's completely untrue," said Gatland. "There has been no alcohol ban in this squad. Some of the stuff has been self-imposed by players. We have had a couple of nights when we have gone back to the hotel and we've had a drink. "And a couple of times we have spoken with [captain] Sam [Warburton] and the senior players about putting the curfew on when the players come back after going out. "You can't keep a lid on everything. You play a night game and there's a lot adrenalin and you say to players 'look go out if you are back in the hotel by 1.30 in the morning'. They might have gone to the casino [but] they are not drinking alcohol - some of them might have had a beer. "There is a lot made that we are whiter than white. We definitely are not." But Gatland admitted he has been impressed with the attitude of his players both on and off the field. "These guys have been great ambassadors in this campaign for Wales," said the coach, whose side set up a meeting with France by beating Ireland in the quarter-finals. "That's what's been important. There has been a sea-shift in terms of the professionalism and the way we have prepared. "These guys have known right from day one that we were in pretty good shape heading towards this World Cup and if we looked after ourselves, both on and off the field, we could made an impact. I think we have done that." Gatland was quick to point out that he has taken little pleasure from England's controversial World Cup, which was haunted by a string of off-the-field controversies. The conduct of some England players resulted in front-page headlines throughout the tournament, prompting the Rugby Football Union to launch a review of player behaviour following the country's quarter-final exit at the hands of France. On one occasion, captain Mike Tindall found his conduct under scrutiny after a group of players were given permission by team manager Martin Johnson to enjoy a night out drinking in Queenstown. As a coach I don't take any satisfaction whatsoever or any pleasure in the criticism that has been heaped on England Tindall, who married the Queen's granddaughter Zara Phillips in July, later issued an apology for misleading the England management over his movements, having initially claimed he did not go on to another bar afterwards. There were other indiscretions, too, notably when centre Manu Tuilagi was formally warned by police and fined £3,000 by England rugby officials after jumping from a ferry in Auckland. "As a coach, I don't take any satisfaction whatsoever or any pleasure in the criticism that has been heaped on England," insisted Gatland. "I know what it's like to be on the wrong side of the media in the past. As a fellow coach, there are a lot of good friends of mine in the England set-up. "I don't take any pleasure - and I'm sure the Welsh team don't take any pleasure - on all that criticism that has been heaped on England. "So, I just want to say we are no monks, we are not whiter than white and we have had our problems in the past."	Coach Warren Gatland denies Wales have been existing "like monks" during their World Cup campaign in New Zealand.
US and European bond prices have sunk in expectation that he will enact inflationary policies that speed the pace of interest rate rises. On Monday, some bond yields - which rise as the price falls - hit their highest for more than six months. Bonds globally lost $1.29tn (Â£1tn) last week, according to Bank of America. And there is no sign that the bond sell-off is easing, depressing the value of some pension investments and making it more expensive for countries and companies to borrow money. On Monday, the 30-year US Treasury jumped above 3% for the first time since January. In the UK, the 10-year gilt yields returned to levels not seen since June's Brexit referendum vote. And German 30-year bunds rose above 1% for the first time since early May. Italian bonds have been among the most affected. Rome's 10-year yields rose four basis points to 2.01% on Monday, their highest in 14 months. "It is a continuation of this recent trend. There are still these expectations that inflation could go up if the US takes a more expansionary fiscal stance," said DZ Bank strategist Daniel Lenz said. Jim Cielinski, head of fixed income at Columbia Threadneedle, said the sell-off trend was not surprising, but the "ferocity of the reversal" was. And in a research note for Societe Generale, analyst Daniel Fermon said that rising interest rates may not be a good thing. "As central banks are now less active in the bond market and Trump expects to cut taxes and launch a $1tn infrastructure investment plan, increasing the deficit, we believe rising US long-term rates remain a major risk for financial markets," he said. Investors had piled into bonds, seeking a safe - but low - rate of return during what has been years of sluggish growth in the US, Europe and Japan. But since inflation and interest rates are seen as likely to rise, investors are seeking assets with a more attractive return. With a Trump administration promising economic stimulus through spending and tax cuts, investors are worried about putting money into low fixed-payment assets, such as bonds. That has fuelled share markets since last Wednesday's election result. Wall Street's Dow Jones index closed at another record high on Friday, in the wake of Mr Trump's unexpected victory. European markets have also risen, and at midday on Monday, the FTSE 100, Cac-40 and Dax were all slightly higher. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei index hitting a nine-month high, closing up 1.7%. Bond yields are up in the eurozone's financially stressed countries, such as Italy, Spain and Portugal and the moves have been quite pronounced over the last few days.  Rising government borrowing costs were one of the central features of the region's financial crisis. So are we are looking at a re-run? There are three important differences to keep in mind. Those borrowing costs are still well below crisis levels. At the time, a rule of thumb for whether a bailout was needed was ten-year government borrowing costs of more than 7%. Italy has just gone over 2%, Portugal is 3.5%. And it's happening to them all. Even ultra-safe Germany has seen its government bond yields rise, although they are much lower than Italy's. And the impetus is coming from outside, from political events in the US. Still, it is clear that Europe still has its weaknesses, especially in some countries' banks - Italy and Germany's Deutsche Bank most notably. The dollar has also strengthened against major currencies. The pound fell 1.1% to $1.2464. Currencies in many emerging markets - from the Mexican peso and Malaysian ringgit, to Turkey's lira and South African rand - fell on fears that protectionism and higher US interest could suck investment from these markets. "Clearly the market has settled on a 'buy dollar' theme, on the basis there will be a debt-fuelled US fiscal binge that will push up inflation," said TD Securities' European head of currency strategy Ned Rumpeltin. "There are signs that higher bond yields and the knock of a stronger US dollar are having a domino impact, taking down the weakest risky assets first, before moving on to the next," said Deutsche's global co-head of foreign exchange, Alan Ruskin. And a senior European Central Bank (ECB) has warned that the uncertainty caused by sudden swings in the financial markets threatened economic recovery. Speaking in Frankfurt on Monday, ECB vice-president Vitor Constancio said: "We should be cautious in drawing hasty, positive conclusions from those market developments, because they may not necessarily indicate that the world economy will have an accelerating recovery with higher growth."	A wave of selling sweeping across bond markets resumed on Monday as investors continued to digest the impact of a Donald Trump presidency.
After the League Two side's bright start, two quick goals from Diafra Sakho and Andre Ayew gave the Premier League side control before half-time. Sakho slotted in his first goal since November from Sam Byram's pass, before Ayew tucked into the same bottom corner moments later. The hosts went close via Harry Pell's volley and Jordon Forster's header. James Collins and Byram both could have added further goals for the visitors, who made seven changes following top-flight losses at Manchester United and Southampton. The best moment for Cheltenham, who were unchanged from Saturday's 3-0 league defeat by Carlisle, came with Pell's low volley across goal, but onrushing substitute Dan Holman could not quite get the required touch as he slid in at the far post. The two sides' only previous meeting came at the same stage of this competition four years ago, resulting in a narrow 2-1 win for Hammers at their old home Upton Park. The fourth-tier side performed respectfully again on Wednesday, but did not sufficiently test Hammers goalkeeper Adrian. Slaven Bilic's side could have won by a greater margin, but Robins captain Kyle Storer cleared Angelo Ogbonna's fierce header off the line in the first half and, moments later, keeper Jonathan Flatt did well to stop Sakho turning in Ayew's low cross. Cheltenham's exit ended League Two's representation in the EFL Cup before Thursday's third-round draw. Match ends, Cheltenham Town 0, West Ham United 2.

Further caps are coming into effect on roaming - or connection - charges within all 28 countries of the European Union (EU). From June next year, roaming charges in the EU will be abolished completely. The government said that those making calls, downloading data or texting would save millions of pounds in charges following the latest changes. "Roughly a million Brits stay the night in Europe every day, and they spend around Â£350m a year on roaming charges," said Ed Vaizey, the minister for the digital economy. "So by realising these changes, we're going to save British consumers millions of pounds a year." The charge cap will also apply in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Consumers pay roaming charges whenever they connect to an operator based abroad. The charges are in addition to the cost of the call itself, and for short calls they can make up a large proportion of the overall fee. The biggest reductions will be for people downloading data - such as emails, pictures or social media - where the roaming charge will be cut by about 75%. Charges for outgoing phone calls will be cut by a similar amount. The charge for texting will be reduced by about 66%. So whereas those making a phone call in Europe would previously have paid roughly 16.5p to get connected, they will now pay just 4p. The charge is repeated for every minute of the call. Data downloads, which previously cost a maximum of 17.4p, will also now cost 4p for each megabyte of data. When the call charges themselves are taken into consideration, the government says the average total cost of a phone call should fall by more than half. Not all customers will see a reduction, however, as some operators include roaming charges within special packages. O2 said most of its customers would see immediate reductions, while EE said the majority of its customers would not be affected. Three already provides free roaming for most of its customers in a limited number of countries. Mr Vaizey questioned what would happen to the roaming charge caps should the UK vote to leave the EU. "I don't know what would happen if we leave the EU, and that's the problem," he told the BBC. "They might stay, or they might not stay." The controls on charges are being introduced under an EU regulation - not a directive - which means they have not been specifically incorporated into UK law. So if the UK voted to leave the EU, it could decide whether it wanted to keep them or not. The Vote Leave campaign said the UK would be able to retain the price caps if it wanted to. "These charges are being abolished across Europe and abroad. There is no evidence to suggest that they will go up if we vote leave," said Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave.	UK consumers using their mobile phones in Europe will see reductions in their bills from Saturday.
The work shows that DNA and its chemical cousin RNA are not unique in their ability to encode information and to pass it on through heredity. The work,             reported in Science , is promising for future "synthetic biology" and biotechnology efforts. It also hints at the idea that if life exists elsewhere, it could be bound by evolution but not by similar chemistry. In fact, one reason to mimic the functions of DNA and RNA - which helps cells to manufacture proteins - is to determine how they came about at the dawn of life on Earth; many scientists believe that RNA arose first but was preceded by a simpler molecule that performed the same function. However, it has remained unclear if any other molecule can participate in the same unzipping and copying processes that give DNA and RNA their ability to pass on the information they carry in the sequences of their nucleobases - the five chemical group "letters" from which the the two molecules' genetic information is composed. The classic double-helix structure of DNA is like a twisted ladder, where the steps are made from paired nucleobases (RNA is typically a single helix). Philipp Holliger of the UK Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology and a team of colleagues created six different DNA- and RNA-like molecules - xeno-nucleic acids, or XNAs - by replacing not the nucleobases but the sugar groups that make up the sides of the ladder. "There's a lot of chemisty that seeks to build alternative nucleic acids, and people have been modifying the bases, the sugars and the backbone, but what we were focusing on was the type of nucleic acid or polymers that would retain the ability to communicate with the natural DNA," Dr Holliger explained in an interview for the Science podcast. Because the nucleobases themselves were the same as those of DNA and RNA, the resulting molecules were able to join with their natural counterparts. The effect is similar to work             recently published in Nature Chemistry , showing that another sugar-substituted DNA analogue could be made to pair up with DNA itself. But the crucial point in creating a full "synthetic genetics" is a set of nucleic acids like DNA and RNA that can not only carry genetic information, but would also allow it to be changed and passed on - evolution and heredity. That requires a set of helper molecules called polymerases, which, once DNA or RNA "unzip" and expose their genetic information, help create new DNA molecules from those instructions. Dr Holliger and his colleagues have developed polymerases that efficiently transcribe the code of their synthetic DNA to natural DNA and then from that back to another synthetic DNA. The process of evolution was encouraged in the lab; one of their DNA analogues was designed to cling to a particular protein or RNA target, those that failed to do so were washed away. As successive copies of those that stuck were made, variations in the genetic code - and the resulting structure the molecules took on - led to ever more tightly attached XNAs. "We've been able to show that both heredity - information storage and propagation - and evolution, which are really two hallmarks of life, can be reproduced and implemented in alternative polymers other than DNA and RNA," Dr Holliger explained. "There is nothing 'Goldilocks' about DNA and RNA - there is no overwhelming functional imperative for genetic systems or biology to be based on these two nucleic acids." In             an accompanying article in Science , Gerald Joyce of the Scripps Research Institute wrote that "the work heralds the era of synthetic genetics, with implications for exobiology (life elsewhere in the Universe), biotechnology, and understanding of life itself". But the work does not yet represent a full synthetic genetics platform, he pointed out. For that, a self-replicating system that does not require the DNA intermediary must be developed. With that in hand, "construction of genetic systems based on alternative chemical platforms may ultimately lead to the synthesis of novel forms of life".	Researchers have succeeded in mimicking the chemistry of life in synthetic versions of DNA and RNA molecules.
The pipe in Chester Green, Derby, burst at about 04:30 GMT on Sunday, sending water gushing along Mansfield Road. Ivy House School and Carlyle Infant School in Littleover were closed, while people in Chaddesden, Littleover and Mackworth reported brown water coming from taps. Severn Trent Water said it could take up to five days to fix the problems. Mansfield Road has been shut to traffic and bus services have been re-routed. Sarah O'Kane from Severn Trent apologised for the inconvenience and said reasons for the pipe failure would not be known until the road had been dug up. Shops and businesses on Mansfield Road are still open.	Two schools have been closed after a burst water pipe flooded the area with mud and silt.
The man, believed to be in his thirties, suffered neck injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene outside Southwark Park Primary School. One witness tweeted he saw "a lot of blood" in the area after the accident at Banyard Road at around 11:00 GMT. A Met Police spokesman said the incident had been referred to the Health and Safety Executive. Another witness, Charlie Brenland said he saw police cordon off the road, adding: "Witnesses and the police said there had been an accident with a worker on one of the trees. "Someone there said one of the tree surgeons had an accident with a chainsaw." Emergency services, including a London Air Ambulance attended the scene shortly after 11:00 GMT but were unable to save the man. A London Ambulance Service spokesperson said: "Sadly, despite the extensive efforts of our crews, a patient died at the scene." The Metropolitan Police said next of kin had been informed.	A tree surgeon has died after reportedly injuring himself with a chainsaw in south London.
Landlord Mr Jones, 46, died at The Blossoms public house in Holyhead on Friday afternoon. Following a stand-off with police on the roof of a neighbouring pub, a 24-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder. He remains in custody A family tribute read: "A partner, soul mate, father, brother, uncle and our best friend. We love you." A post mortem examination was carried out on Saturday but North Wales Police say they are not releasing Mr Jones's cause of death yet. Officers have made a specific appeal to speak to people who were on board the number four Arriva Bus which left Bangor bus station at 14:00 GMT on Friday and arrived at Summerhill in Holyhead at about 16:00. Det Chf Insp Iestyn Davies said: "It is understood that the bus was caught in traffic around the Black Bridge area of Holyhead as events at the Blossoms public house were unfolding."	The man whose death at an Anglesey pub sparked a murder investigation has been named as David Jones.
Alan Knight, 51, admitted murdering David Bond, 50, in Worthing and was sentenced at Hove Crown Court to serve at least 19 years. After the hearing, Sussex Police said the killing in August followed a row over the cleanliness of the house in Osmonde Close where they both lived. Det Ch Insp Tanya Jones said the tipping point was the microwave oven. Describing the level of violence as "horrendous", she said: "His reaction was extreme for something, which in reality, was very small." Police said Mr Bond was last seen on 6 August in The Warwick pub, but an argument began after he arrived home. Knight texted his friend to say his landlord had asked him to move out. He wrote: "Shall I just kill him and you find me somewhere to duck till we get a plan..." Police said he later messaged the friend to say he was "only joking" but then sent six images of Mr Bond's body, which she did not believe. The next day, Knight drove Mr Bond's car to Hove and withdrew Â£600 before abandoning the car in London and visiting a friend in Southend. The friend later told Essex Police she believed he had killed his landlord. Shortly afterwards, Sussex Police went to Mr Bond's house where his body had been seen. Det Ch Insp Jones said Knight knew what he was doing and described it as "a cold and calculated crime". She said the pair only lived together for about six months. In a statement, Mr Bond's family said: "David was a caring loving son and father to his two sons, David Jr and Christopher. Out of no reason, his life was taken away cruelly."	A lodger has been jailed for life for stabbing his landlord 29 times after a row about cleanliness.
Pte Sean Benton, 20, from Hastings, was found with five bullet wounds to his chest in June 1995 while on guard at a perimeter fence at Deepcut. An original inquest into his death recorded a verdict of suicide. His family applied for a new hearing after using the Human Rights Act to access evidence held by police. His twin, Tony Benton, and sister, Tracy Lewis, wept and said: "We are just happy and relieved. It's been too long." A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said: "We care deeply about our young recruits and our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Private Sean Benton." BBC Local Live: For the latest updates and more news The malevolent culture at Deepcut barracks Justice Collins said fresh evidence had "come to light which casts some doubt upon the correctness" of the original decision. He added that under article two of the Human Rights Act there was material that questioned the care Pte Benton received from the Army at the time. Mrs Lewis said: "Our family had just 20 years with Sean. It has taken us another 21 to secure the thorough, independent inquiry we should have seen immediately after his death." "For two decades, our family has been tormented by questions about what Sean went through at Deepcut," she added. "If his death had been properly investigated in 1995, we would have been spared years of uncertainty and pain. "It should be a source of huge shame to the Ministry of Defence and Surrey Police that our mother had to fight for so long - far longer than she should have had to - to force the authorities to answer basic questions." The family said the original inquest took less than two hours and heard from six people. A criminal investigation seven years later found no evidence of third party involvement. Pte Benton's medical records were not obtained and no evidence was gathered or presented about his experiences at the base. The family, who are represented by human rights group Liberty, believe he was subjected to severe bullying. In a statement, the MoD said: "The Armed Forces will not tolerate abuse, bullying, or discrimination. All allegations are taken very seriously and will be thoroughly investigated, either by the civil or military police and, where appropriate, action will be taken." "It would be inappropriate to comment further while legal proceedings are ongoing -  we will assist the coroner as necessary," it added. Pte Benton was the first of four young soldiers to die at the barracks between 1995 and 2002. Pte Cheryl James, 18, from Llangollen, North Wales, shot herself in November 1995, according to a second inquest into her death which concluded in June. However, the coroner criticised a lack of training, structure and inappropriate sexual relationships in the camp. Pte James' father, Des, said he had applied to the MoD for a full public inquiry into what went on at the barracks. Pte Geoff Gray, 17, from Hackney, east London, was found dead with two gunshot wounds to his head on 17 September 2001. Pte James Collinson, 17, from Perth, was found dead with a single gunshot wound through his chin on 23 March 2002. A date for the fresh inquest into Pte Benton's death is yet to be set.	A fresh inquest can take place into the death of a young soldier at an army barracks in Surrey 21 years ago, a high court judge has ruled.
More than 20 firefighters were sent to the Westmorland Shopping Centre in Kendal just after 08:00 BST when smoke was spotted by a member of staff. A cordon was put in place around the split-level complex, which houses about 30 shops and an indoor market. A fire service spokesman said the blaze was quickly extinguished and no-one was injured. He said the site would remain closed for a time for smoke to be ventilated from the building.	A Cumbria shopping centre had to be evacuated after a fire started in a shop storeroom.
8 September 2016 Last updated at 15:33 BST The fruit is still attached to the plant and is not yet ripe enough to eat. Austin Grant from Sheffield had been dubious about the suitability of South Yorkshire's climate, but has finally seen some results. "I was literally jumping for joy," the 62-year-old grandfather said.	A gardener has said he was "flabbergasted" that his banana plant has finally provided fruit after nine-years.
Led by Rev Syd Graham, the private service for the couple from Bankfoot was held in Perth Crematorium on Crieff Road at 12:00. The event lasted about 45 minutes and was also be broadcast on speakers outside the crematorium. The funeral of Jim and Anne McQuire, the other Scots couple killed in the Sousse attacks, took place on Friday. The Grahams were visiting the resort to celebrate Mrs Graham's 50th birthday. Mr Graham, 51, had worked as a turnstile operator at St Johnstone Football Club for seven years. They were among the 30 Britons who died in the attack on 26 June, which killed 38 people. Three Irish nationals, two Germans, one Belgian, one Portuguese and one Russian also died.	The funeral for Billy and Lisa Graham, who were killed in last month's terror attacks in Tunisia, has taken place.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan hit out after German authorities cancelled rallies designed to woo ethnic Turkish voters in Germany ahead of a key referendum. "Your practices are not different from the Nazi practices of the past," Mr Erdogan said. German Justice Minister Heiko Maas said the comments were "abstruse, malicious and absurd". About 1.4m Turks in Germany can vote in the April referendum, which could give Mr Erdogan sweeping new powers. Voters will be asked whether they back a new constitution, which would transform the country from a parliamentary republic into a presidential one. That would give Mr Erdogan, as president, new powers over the budget and the appointment of ministers and judges, as well as the power to dismiss parliament. They are Nato allies and major trading partners but that has not stopped Turkey's president from lashing out at Germany in an exchange you might expect from countries at war. With a referendum soon to take place in Turkey, German local officials cancelled a political rally of the Turkish diaspora in Germany that Turkey's justice minister had planned to address. Mr Erdogan said that showed Germany had "no relation with democracy". Berlin was infuriated after a German-Turkish journalist for the newspaper Die Welt was imprisoned in Turkey for alleged terrorism propaganda. Deniz Yucel had written about leaked emails that purport to show the influence of Mr Erdogan's son-in-law, who is the country's energy minister. The German government has called for Mr Yucel's release. Turkey accuses Germany of harbouring terrorist groups. Mr Erdogan has described the journalist as an "agent" of the PKK Kurdish militants that Germany was "sheltering at the German consulate". Many see in the president's rhetoric an attempt to win the support of Turkish ultranationalists here before the referendum in April. But in the process, a vital relationship between two countries - Nato partners and major trading allies - has reached a new low. Speaking to German broadcaster ARD, Mr Maas said banning Mr Erdogan from visiting Germany or breaking off diplomatic ties would "play straight into the arms of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, which no one wants". Russia and Turkey have steadily improved ties as both countries' relations with the EU have cooled. The deputy leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party, Julia Kloeckner, said Mr Erdogan was "reacting like a stubborn child who can't get his own way". Mr Erdogan has come under intense international criticism amid a far-reaching crackdown on his opponents since a failed military coup last year. Dozens of Turkish journalists and writers have been arrested, and a large number of diplomats and soldiers have sought asylum elsewhere. Against this background, Turkey is targeting the millions of expatriate voters eligible to cast a ballot in the controversial poll - including the 1.4m in Germany. However, officials have withdrawn permission for rallies in Gaggenau, Cologne and Frechen. The Gaggenau authorities said there was insufficient space for the rally, while Cologne officials said they had been misled about the purpose of the event. Addressing the German authorities at a rally in Istanbul on Sunday, Mr Erdogan said: "I thought it's been a long time since Germany left [Nazi practices]. We are mistaken." His comments were in reference to the German Nazi party, which Adolf Hitler led to power from 1933 and 1945. The Nazis were responsible for the mass murder of six million Jews and millions of other people during, World War II. The cancellations of the rallies in Germany came as a German-Turkish journalist was detained in Turkey, accused of being a member of the outlawed Kurdish militant group PKK. Mr Erdogan has called the journalist - who works for well-established German newspaper Die Welt - a "German agent" and accused Germany of "aiding and harbouring terror". German officials said such allegations were absurd. Separately, the Austrian chancellor called for an EU-wide ban on political campaigning by Turkish politicians. "A collective EU response to prevent such campaign events would make sense so that individual countries like Germany where appearances are forbidden don't end up being pressured by Turkey,"  Christian Kern told German newspaper Welt am Sonntag. He also said the decades-long talks over Turkey joining the EU should be abandoned because the country had been "trampling on human rights and basic democratic rights". "We can't continue negotiating about membership with a country that has been distancing itself from democratic norms and rule-of-law principles for years." Austria has previously said Mr Erdogan cannot campaign in the country over the referendum.	Turkey's president has compared German officials to Nazis, in the latest escalation in a war of words.
Swiss Xhaka, 24, is believed to have been with a friend who had visited him in London and was returning home. The man is understood to have arrived late for his flight back to Germany and was not allowed to board. It is at this point that the racial abuse is alleged to have occurred. Arsenal have declined to comment other than to say it is a private matter that is now in the hands of the police. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police told the BBC: "Police were called at 19:29 GMT on Monday, 23 January following an allegation that a member of staff had been racially abused at Heathrow Airport, Terminal Five. "The allegation was made by a third party. Officers attended and spoke with a man in his 20s. He was not arrested. He voluntarily attended a west London police station where he was interviewed under caution. Enquires continue." The incident occurred just over 24 hours after Xhaka was sent off during his team's 2-1 victory over Burnley in the Premier League.	Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka has been interviewed under caution by police following an allegation he racially abused an airline staff member at Heathrow on Monday night.
NASUWT members in Derry City, Strabane, Mid Ulster, Fermanagh and Omagh council areas will strike on 31 January. The union's teachers in Belfast and Newtownabbey staged a strike on 30 November closing a number of schools. Members of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation (INTO) are also due to stage a half-day strike on 18 January. In October, all teaching unions in Northern Ireland rejected an offer that would have seen their pay frozen last year and a rise of 1% for 2016-17. NASUWT regretted the further action, but had no choice but to take it, said its general secretary, Chris Keates. "Strike action can be avoided if there is an improvement on the 0% pay award for 2015/16 and a genuine commitment to meet with the NASUWT to seek to resolve our trade dispute," she said. The union's official in Northern Ireland, Justin McCamphill, said the strike was the responsibility of the education minister, Peter Weir, and the teaching employers. "Parents will also recognise that unless teachers are recognised and rewarded as highly-skilled professionals and have working conditions which free them to focus on teaching and learning, there will be a long-term detrimental impact on the quality of education provision for their children," he said. However, members of two other teaching unions, the Ulster Teachers' Union (UTU) and Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), have voted not to strike. Instead they are taking action short of a strike including non-co-operation with school inspections by the ETI. Peter Weir has previously called the strike action "futile" and urged the unions to negotiate pay settlements for the years ahead. The unions are due to meet the teaching employers again for talks on 12 January.	Teachers belonging to the National Association of Schoolmasters and Women Teachers are to stage a one-day strike over pay, workload and job insecurity.
The woman, aged in her 20s, was attacked after leaving the event's Chinawhite enclosure early on Sunday, with men she met there. She walked with them to the Harpsden Road and Reading Road area and was raped outside a car, which the men then drove off in. A passerby found the victim near the Three Horseshoes pub shortly after. Daniel Grist, secretary of the regatta, said: "We have been liaising with Thames Valley Police, regarding this terrible incident, which took place after Regatta facilities had closed and racing had finished for the day on Saturday 1 July. "The Chinawhite area is not located on land managed by Henley Royal Regatta but we will continue to assist Thames Valley Police and are working with them to secure CCTV footage to assist in identifying the perpetrators." Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses, and specially-trained officers are supporting the woman, who left the Chinawhite enclosure between 00:00 and 02:30 BST. Det Ch Insp Lis Knight said such incidents were rare in the area. The Â£3m rowing regatta sees more than 200 races take place on the river Thames over five days. The annual regatta, which has been held since 1839, was expected to attract 200,000 spectators to this year's event.	Organisers of the Henley Royal Regatta are supplying hours of CCTV footage to police after a woman was raped.
Boro remain second behind Burnley and ahead of Brighton on goal difference, with the league's top three sides equal on 87 points after 44 games. Ipswich keeper Bartosz Bialkowski made fine saves to keep Stewart Downing and Jordan Rhodes out before the break. Rhodes then went closest to winning it, hitting the post after the break. Boro's 22nd Championship clean sheet of the season was enough to extend their unbeaten run to eight games, but their profligacy sees them wedged between Burnley and Brighton in the race for automatic promotion to the Premier League with two games remaining. Ipswich's hopes of finishing in the top six were unlikely even before kick-off, with Sheffield Wednesday moving nine points clear in the last remaining play-off spot with a 1-1 draw at Derby County. Ghana international Albert Adomah and £9m February arrival Rhodes - denied in a one-on-one by Bialkowski in the 34th minute - were particularly bright for Boro in the first half, while defender Paul Digby, making his first Ipswich start, made a crucial tackle to foil Emilio Nsue before half-time. Gaston Ramirez was industrious for Boro after the break, and helped create the best chance of the game, only for Rhodes to hit the inside of the post after beating Bialkowski. Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy: "If I've done one person a favour it's (Brighton manager) Chris Hughton, because he's a mate and he's such a wonderful guy. "So Chris, that's a point for you. I hope we've helped him get promoted. "I haven't got a clue who is going to go up though. I tipped Derby when they beat us, I tipped Middlesbrough when they beat us at our place, I tipped Burnley at one stage, Hull when they beat us - all of them slapped us. Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka: "We have to be positive. I said a month ago that we were in a good position, and I would say that we are in an amazing position now. "We have two games to go, one at home, and we are more mature now and have a better squad (than last season). We are going to be more rested than we were today. For that reason, I have to be positive and transmit a positive message. "I don't know how many chances we need to score a goal because the score today should have been three or four-nil. We had a lot of clear chances, but we couldn't score. "We have played seven games in 23 days, and in this period, to win five and draw the other two games when everybody is tired is really good."

Eight people started fighting at the Palace Theatre in Manchester on the opening night of the Irish dance show. Georgina Lynn Sixsmith, 48, has been charged with being drunk and disorderly and assault on a constable, police said. There were no reports of injuries. The theatre has not commented. The trouble began in the orchestra stalls during Tuesday's performance of Lord Of The Dance: Dangerous Games, directed and choreographed by Irish dance superstar Flatley. The show is described as a high-energy, two-hour fusion of dance styles - from traditional Irish dance to tap and modern - and involves a story of good versus evil, with a Hunger Games flavour. Ms Sixsmith, of Andrew Street, Middleton, has been bailed to appear at Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court on 10 May.	A brawl broke out between audience members during a Hunger Games-inspired performance of Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance.
North Wales Police added that from those tests, 60 arrests were made. It follows a report earlier in December which said motorists are more likely to be tested for drink driving in north Wales than anywhere else in the UK. Det Ch Con Gareth Pritchard warned motorists not to be tempted to drink and drive. He said: "Officers will continue to carry out breath tests across north Wales as part of our campaign to reduce deaths on the roads."	More than 13,000 people have been tested for drink and drug driving in north Wales the run up to Christmas, police said.
Super-fan Ross Morgan was watching the Ipswich v Norwich match at home when Paul Anderson scored a goal. In his excitement Ross leaped into the air and accidently punched the hole. He said: "I went for a fist pump while jumping up at the same time. The next thing I knew I had gone through the ceiling." Ross later posted a picture of the hole online, and goal-scorer Anderson, offered to pay for the repairs. Ipswich fan Ross said: "I was pretty shocked by that. It's a great gesture from him."	A footballer has offered to pay for the damage to a fan's ceiling, after they punched the air - and the ceiling - in celebration of him scoring a goal.
The former hooker will replace Chris Gibbes, who confirmed in January he will become head coach of the Wellington Lions in New Zealand. Capped eight times by Ireland, Clarke was a part of the Ulster team which won the 1999 Heineken Cup. "I'm delighted to have this opportunity and really excited about the next challenge in my career," said Clarke. As a coach, the 49-year-old helped the province win the 2006 Celtic League title before joining the Irish Rugby Union as high performance manager. He returned to Ulster in 2012 and became forwards coach two years later. Clarke also has international coaching experience with Ireland A and Emerging Ireland, with whom he won the 2015 Tbilisi Cup ahead of Georgia, Italy A and Uruguay. "I'm looking forward to the challenge," added Clarke. "It's an ambitious organisation with a great mix of experience and some real talent coming through and I hope I can add value for the players, the coaches and the management. "Chris Gibbes has done a great job in building a pack that has the potential to go toe-to-toe with anyone and I'm grateful to have that platform to work from when I arrive in the summer."	Ulster forwards coach Allen Clarke will join Ospreys at the end of the season.
Fifa president Sepp Blatter announced plans last week to form an 11-person panel to review football's scandal-hit world governing body. Domenico Scala had earlier said he would only lead the taskforce if he is guaranteed full independence. The Swiss businessman is already the independent chair of Fifa's audit and compliance committee. Scala was believed to have been prepared to lead the taskforce, after meeting presidents of three of Fifa's six continental confederations. But a spokesman for Scala told BBC Sport: "Domenico Scala never applied for such a chairmanship." He added that the post would only be considered "under the strict condition" that "independence was guaranteed". As well as an independent chair, the taskforce will have two representatives from the AFC (Asia), CAF (Africa), Concacaf (North, Central America and the Caribbean) and Uefa (Europe), as well as one representative from each of Conmebol (South America) and the OFC (Oceania). In a statement, Fifa said representatives from federations would not necessarily have to be "members of the football community" and the confederations could decide that themselves. Blatter, who has announced his intention to stand down as president, has said presidential term limits and integrity checks for top officials are potential areas of reform. Recommendations are due to be presented at the next meeting of Fifa's executive committee in Zurich on 24 and 25 September. The prospect of Scala leading an independent review of Fifa was described as "laughable" by campaign group New Fifa Now. And Alexandra Wrage, who resigned from Fifa's independent governance committee in April 2013 in protest at a lack of meaningful action, said even an independent chairman of the reform taskforce "can't work". She told BBC Sport: "The process needs to be taken out of Fifa's hands. Short of that, it's another reform dead-end." Blatter's resignation on 2 June followed the arrest of seven Fifa officials as part of a United States investigation that saw 14 people indicted on corruption charges. A separate criminal investigation by Swiss authorities into how the 2018 and 2022 World Cups were allocated is also under way.	Fifa has said its reform taskforce will be chaired by an independent person from outside of football.
That phrase hinted both at an ideal flexible arrangement in the future and an ideal shared approach from both the UK and Irish governments, together stressing to the EU the paramount importance of doing nothing that might constitute any kind of risk to the political progress made over recent decades. But is that seamless approach unravelling and could Brexit become a source of greater friction between the two governments? Both the Brexit Secretary David Davis and DUP leader Arlene Foster have been fond of talking about technology as the answer to Ireland's post-Brexit problems. Yes, they acknowledge, putting old-style customs checkpoints right on the border would be unacceptable for both political and security reasons. However, they then go on to suggest that provided businesses co-operate with computerised trusted trader schemes, and cameras with number plate recognition capability are installed some distance away from the frontier, all will be well. By contrast, the Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney has now warned that technology isn't the answer. Instead, he argues there is a need for a wider political agreement. What does that mean? On the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Fine Gael Senator Neale Richmond hinted that the Irish favour moving customs controls to seaports and airports, rather than anywhere near the land border. This might sound geographically sensible, but the political implications should not be underestimated. Arlene Foster has previously said that putting a border down the middle of the Irish Sea, creating a divide between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, is something her party will not tolerate. So long as the DUP-Conservative parliamentary arrangement survives, that is a concern David Davis and Theresa May will have to take very seriously. But, if the DUP has the ear of the British government, then similarly as a loyal EU member state, Dublin has the ear of Michel Barnier's negotiating team. Since becoming foreign minister, Simon Coveney has not been shy about making his differences with the UK clear. He voiced his concern for Northern Ireland having special EU status, which contrasted with the position of his predecessor Charlie Flanagan. Some surmised this might only have been a slip of the tongue. However Mr Coveney's decision to let it be known he favoured a bespoke Irish Language Act (Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and Alliance's preference) over a hybrid bill (the DUP's suggestion) was a clear move to distance Dublin from the Northern Ireland Office's studied neutrality on the issue. If the border after Brexit becomes a more open source of arm wrestling between the two governments, that could have consequences  - not just for the continuing UK/EU negotiations, but also for the Stormont talks when they resume in earnest in the autumn.	For months, it's been the joint mantra from both Dublin and London - that after Brexit, the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland should be as "seamless and frictionless as possible".
The man's bike was in collision with a car in the village at around noon on Sunday. It happened close to the junction with the Kilkeel Road and Pat's Road. The man's name has not been released. Police said the car driver is assisting officers with their inquiries.	A motorcyclist who was injured in a crash in Ballymartin, County Down, at the weekend has died in hospital.
The anti-IS group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently said a water pumping station had been hit, along with the Taj Hall and Furousiya area. IS-linked news agency Amaq  also said Raqqa's water supply had been cut. Russia said its bombers had targeted an arms depot, a chemical weapons factory and a training camp. A defence ministry statement said the strikes had inflicted "significant damage" and that a large number of militants had been killed. Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently (RBSS), whose activists have reported on developments on the ground in Raqqa since IS militants seized control of the city in early 2014, said the water pumping station hit in Thursday's strikes was located in the nearby village of Kasrat. Residents found their water had been cut off "totally" afterwards, it added. Amaq also reported the "interruption of the water supply in all neighbourhoods". RBSS said 20 civilians had been killed and 50 others wounded in the air strikes, but the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll higher. It said 24 civilians had died, along with six others whose identities could not yet be confirmed. Raqqa, estimated to have a population of between 250,000 and 500,000, has become the de facto capital of the "caliphate" whose creation was proclaimed by IS two years ago after it took control of large swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq. IS militants are currently under pressure from two separate offensives west and north-west of Raqqa by Russian-backed Syrian government forces and an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters supported by the US.	Air strikes on so-called Islamic State's Syrian stronghold of Raqqa have cut the city's water supply, with 20 civilians reported dead.
The Islamic Center of Boca Raton had planned to host a polling site for the state's primary in August and the general election in November. Officials rescinded the invitation, drawing sharp criticism from Florida lawmakers who said it reinforced religious discrimination. The site was moved to a nearby library. County Elections Supervisor Susan Bucher said she moved the site after receiving about 50 complaints from people who said they did not want to vote in a mosque. The Islamic Center has been used as a polling station at least since 2010, the Washington Post reported. Democratic US Representatives Ted Deutch and Lois Frankel released statements opposing the move. "If we are going to use places of worship as polling places, we should not discriminate,'' Mr Deutch said. It is unclear how many houses of worship are used as polling places across the country, but churches are often selected as host sites because of their large auditoriums and parking lots. Mosques in California, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Ohio have served as polling places, including one that has been used since at least 2004, according to the AP news agency.	A Florida mosque has been removed as a polling station for the 2016 election after local officials received complaints and threats of violence.
More than 20 people are being treated in hospital with burns and other injuries after the incident in the village of Hitrino, local media say. The authorities ordered an evacuation as firefighters battled the blaze. At least 20 buildings were damaged in the derailment and explosion, spokesperson Nikolay Nikolov told Bulgaria's Nova television. Two tanks hit an electricity line and exploded when the train derailed near the village station at about 05:30 local time (03:30 GMT), according to several reports. "Two blasts have caused a serious fire and ruined at least 20 buildings," Interior Ministry Chief Secretary Georgi Kostov told Reuters news agency. "There are many people injured... many with burns." Hitrino, a town of around 800 people, is located in Bulgaria's north-eastern Shumen province, about 60 miles (100km) from the Black Sea. Bulgarian Prime Minister Boiko Borisov said he was travelling to the village. In a post on social media, he said the regional hospital needed blood supplies to cope with the causalities, and appealed to people in the region to donate blood. Transport Minister Ivalyo Moskovski also said he was travelling to the village. In a brief statement, he said he had ordered both the head of the railway accident investigation task force and a representative of the rail infrastructure company to attend the scene.	A train carrying liquid petroleum gas has derailed and exploded in Bulgaria, killing at least four people.
Jairo Medina, 62, a professional carer from Chelsea, was found early on Friday morning by a person walking by who then called the police. Once officers got there, Mr Medina had died. A post mortem examination did not find a cause of death, but it showed that he had been assaulted. Officers are investigating it as a murder. An area about the size of two football pitches was cordoned off. The scene was near the mosaic to commemorate The Reformers' Tree in Hyde Park. The Met Police would like to hear from anyone who may have seen something suspicious in the area between the evening of Thursday 11 August and the early hours of Friday.	A man found dead in London's Hyde Park has been named by police.
Finally, after all the hype and excitement, consumers are about to  get their hands on virtual reality headsets - and we will find out whether there really is a market for this technology. Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive are both released in the next few weeks, and at the Games Developer Conference in San Francisco Sony unveiled its launch date and price. While Playstation owners will have to wait until October to get their hands on the Sony VR headset, they will pay far less for it than for a Vive or Oculus setup. With nearly 40 million PS4 owners around the world, there's a ready-made market for Sony's offering, so by Christmas it's a fair bet that it will be the leader in VR. Mind you, while there is now a huge amount of experimentation around VR and 360 degree video (see last week's BBC Click for example) there is still confusion about how it will be used beyond gaming. At a launch event for Nokia's Ozo 360 camera last night, I was shown a number of demos filmed with the device. I stood next to the vocalist as a band performed, watched as a bear approached a group of nervous people at a campsite, and saw trainee astronauts learning about weightlessness in a swimming pool. The VR headset meant I could choose my own perspective on each scene, but once the novelty wore off the question remained - what is this for? Still, music producers, moviemakers and educationalists are all now producing 360 and VR material, so hopefully they will find an answer to my question. At the end of a week where Google's AI program AlphaGo defeated a champion Go player, the artificial intelligence community is discussing what this triumph of machine over man means. I visited Microsoft's UK research lab in Cambridge where a number of artificial intelligence projects are under way , including one experiment using AI in the game Minecraft and another where a program examines scans of brain tumours. The man who runs the lab, Chris Bishop, says it's wrong to paint a dystopian future in which machines gradually replace us as they get ever smarter. Instead he sees AI as a collaboration between humans and computers - for instance doctors using the brain tumour scanning program to assist their diagnoses rather than replacing them. "We need to talk instead about a partnership in which machine intelligence and human intelligence work together," he says. "It's the case today, and will be the case for some time to come that the capabilities of machines, the capabilities of humans are different and complementary and if they work together they will be stronger than either of them alone." Incidentally, for a different view, have a look at this piece from Tom Chatfield in the Guardian. He argues that in designing AI systems, we humans are making too many concessions to inflexible computers. Back to gaming and we look at the boom in a phenomenon which is familiar to anyone under 25 but a mystery to the older generation - watching video games online. The big player in the live streaming of video games is Twitch, which was bought by Amazon 18 months ago. But we hear from a rival, Ian Sharpe, who says his Azubu streaming service has a different approach. While Twitch lets anyone become a broadcaster, playing anything from Call of Duty to Minecraft, Azubu is more focused on professional eSports. Last  week it signed a deal with the Electronic Sports League to stream exclusive content from esports tournaments - and Ian Sharpe tells us that this is going to be a new boom area for media firms looking to reach those elusive "millennials" who don't watch boring old telly. Tune in to Tech Tent on the BBC World Service at 15:00 GMT for all that and more or catch the podcast later.	On this week's edition of Tech Tent we look at two visions of the future of gaming, and we ask whether we should be worried or excited by the latest advances in artificial intelligence.
The Crues will retain the Gibson Cup if they beat the Lurgan Blues on Saturday and Linfield fail to defeat Coleraine. "We must stay focused, it's definitely not over yet and we still have a job to do," said Crues manager Stephen Baxter. "It's important that we come away from this game with something to push us a little closer to the title." "We had a fantastic game against Glenavon in the Irish Cup a couple of weeks ago, which could have gone either way. "We just have to concentrate on playing the games in front of us and focus on what we are trying to do." "We will go there with confidence after our big win over Linfield last week but we now face two testing away games and Mourneview Park is a difficult place to go," added Baxter. Second-placed Linfield now trail the champions by eight points and Blues manager David Healy has all but conceded defeat in his club's pursuit to overhaul the pacesetters with just four rounds of fixtures remaining. "We now have to make sure we finish second and seal a European place," commented Healy. "Credit to Crusaders as it's often said that it's more difficult to retain a title than to win it so well done to them if they do go on and win it. "We have a cup final to look forward to and I've told the squad that they are playing for starting places in the team for that." Glenavon will hope to bounce back from last week's reverse at the hands of Cliftonville, a result which saw Gary Hamilton's side drop below the Reds in the contest to clinch third position. The Solitude outfit entertain Glentoran, who will be without injured pair Calum Birney (ankle) and Chris Lavery (knee). The battle for valuable points to help avoid the drop continues at the foot of the table as bottom side Warrenpoint Town host Ballinamallard United, who are one point ahead of Barry Gray's charges in 11th. Tenth-placed Carrick Rangers are one point better off than the Mallards but are at home to a Ballymena United side, who are now unbeaten in five matches under new boss David Jeffrey. Struggling Portadown play Dungannon Swifts in the day's other Section B fixture.	Crusaders continue their bid to secure back-to-back Irish League titles for the first time in their history when they face Glenavon at Mourneview Park.
He said payments to them for their image rights were "the most significant risk in football" faced by HMRC. Some footballers and entertainers have income from image rights paid into offshore accounts without tax deducted. HMRC said dozens of footballers are under investigation for potential irregularities in their tax affairs. Mr Thompson told MPs that on the issue of image rights: "I think if it was me, I would want to review this... It is quite difficult to explain to a football fan that that is the law." The HMRC's head of enforcement, Jennie Grainger, said that 43 players, eight agents and 12 football clubs were under investigation. Ms Granger said HMRC has a dedicated team looking at image rights, football, other sports, and the entertainment industry. She told the Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC): "Just on football itself, in the last two years, that team, and wider across HMRC, has brought in £158m in yield." Ms Granger said HMRC is investigating whether some claims to separate image rights earnings from earnings as players are genuine. "Has it been properly transferred? Has it been transferred for a fair value? Should there be income coming back to the UK depending on their residency status? All of those issues can be part of this," she said. The officials also told the PAC that HMRC had seven criminal investigations under way and had made arrests following publication of the Panama Papers, which provided a huge amount of information about the tax affairs of wealthy individuals. The action follows the formation of an inter-agency task force six months ago, including HMRC, the FCA, the Serious Fraud Office and National Crime Agency. At the weekend, the PAC's chairwoman, Meg Hillier, said the tax affairs of football manager Jose Mourinho should be investigated by British officials, following allegations that he used offshore companies to reduce his tax bill. Mourinho is accused of moving millions of pounds of earnings to the British Virgin Islands to avoid paying tax. According to reports in the Sunday Times, Portuguese-born Mourinho, 53, placed £10m (€12m) into a Swiss account owned by a British Virgin Islands (BVI) firm, which it suggests has no employees. The newspaper also claims that Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo used bank accounts and companies in Ireland, Switzerland and New Zealand to process substantial earnings for their image rights. However, Mr Jorge Mendes - the agent for both Mourinho and ex-Manchester United player Ronaldo - denies both claims. He says both men were fully compliant with UK and Spanish tax rules. The statement added that the allegations stemmed from a cyber-attack earlier this year on some sports agents, details of which were prohibited by a Spanish court from being published. HMRC said it would not comment on named individuals, but took "all allegations of tax evasion extremely seriously" and "always investigates allegations of fraud together with any intelligence provided". The head of HMRC will appear before Ms Hillier's committee - which is responsible for overseeing government expenditure - on Friday. Manchester United said the allegations related to events before Mourinho's arrival at the club and so it would not comment.	The chief executive of HM Revenue and Customs, Jon Thompson, has told MPs he would like to see a review of the way footballers can reduce their tax bills.
The cartoon, by prominent artist Jonathan Shapiro, known as Zapiro, also features a poem, which refers to Mr Zuma as a "dick". The latest row comes just weeks after the ANC forced an art gallery to withdraw a painting showing Mr Zuma with his genitals exposed. Mr Zuma is set to face Zapiro in court in October over a different cartoon. The president sued the cartoonist, who works for the Mail & Guardian newspaper, after he depicted Mr Zuma in 2008 about to rape a female figure representing justice. Mr Zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006. The pair have also clashed over Zapiro's portrayal of Mr Zuma with a shower cap on his head - a reference to Mr Zuma's statement in the rape trial that he had taken a shower after having sex to reduce the chance of contracting HIV. "We find it unacceptable and shocking that after the harsh experiences that South Africa, the president and his family has experienced few weeks ago, that Zapiro and the Mail & Guardian will find it appropriate to continue with the insults and hurt to the president, his family and the broader ANC constituency," the ANC said in a statement. "All South Africans share our disgust." The painting in the gallery triggered a huge debate in South Africa about the freedom of expression and the right to privacy. Before the gallery agreed to remove the painting, called The Spear, it was vandalised by two men. In an affidavit, Mr Zuma said: "The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect." Mr Zuma, who has four wives, has previously sued local media companies 11 times for defamation.	South Africa's governing ANC has expressed its "disgust" at a cartoon of President Jacob Zuma as a penis.
He welcomed Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Enda Kenny's comments on a possible referendum on Irish unity. DUP MP Ian Paisley said Mr Kenny was "being mischievous". The taoiseach said Brexit talks should consider that a clause in the Good Friday Agreement could result in the calling of a referendum. In his remarks to reporters on Monday at the annual MacGill Summer School in Glenties, County Donegal, Mr Kenny said the triggering of a border poll required "clear evidence of a majority of people wishing to leave the UK and join the Republic". He added: "It may be, in the eyes of some, a fanciful theory but who knows what happens in 10, 20 years time?" Adams responded by calling for all parties supporting a united Ireland "to discuss how best this can be achieved." "In the context of the north being dragged out of the EU by England, there is now a greater opportunity to achieve this," he said. North Antrim MP Mr Paisley said Secretary of State James Brokenshire and his predecessor, Theresa Villiers, had both ruled out holding a referendum. "It's not going to happen," he said. "We all know in the next nine months Enda Kenny is not going to be taoiseach. So, he's really just being mischievous.," Mr Paisley added. Ulster Unionist MLA Jenny Palmer described Mr Kenny's comments as "much ado about nothing". She said that, in the wake of the EU referendum, the Stormont executive's priority should be "to convince the people of Northern Ireland that they have a plan for the way forward for our economy, our farmers, our voluntary and community groups, our universities and everyone else who depends heavily on EU funding and support."	Sinn FÃ©in leader Gerry Adams has said there is "a need to be open and imaginative" on new constitutional arrangements.
In an open letter to the girls, she criticised Nigeria's authorities and the international community for not doing enough to secure their release. The Boko Haram militants caused global outrage after abducting the girls from Nigeria's north-eastern Chibok town. The UN estimates that the insurgency has now displaced 800,000 children. "We cannot imagine the full extent of the horrors you have endured. But please know this: we will never forget you," Ms Yousafzai said in the letter to the 219 girls who were abducted during a night-time raid on their boarding school. She added that there were reasons for "hope and optimism", after recent successes by Nigeria's military in regaining territory from Boko Haram. "I look forward to the day I can hug each one of you, pray with you, and celebrate your freedom with your families," Ms Yousafzai said. In Nigeria, campaign group Bring Back Our Girls has launched a week of events encouraging people to remember the girls ahead of the first anniversary of their abduction on Tuesday. A vigil and candlelit procession is due to be held in the capital Abuja. The UN children's agency, Unicef, said the abduction of the schoolgirls from Chibok was "only one of the endless tragedies being replicated on an epic scale across Nigeria and the region". The number of children fleeing the Boko Haram insurgency has doubled in the past year and more than 1.5 million people have now been displaced in the six-year conflict, Unicef said in a report.	Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai has called for more action to free schoolgirls abducted by militant Islamists in Nigeria a year ago.
On that Sunday morning, on 27 November 1994, Celtic awaited but also the sense that a side assembled from youth players and journeymen could achieve something remarkable. As the squad boarded the team bus, nobody was allowed to sit at the first table on the right-hand side of the aisle. "That is where we are going to put the Cup on the way back," the captain, Gordon Dalziel, told his team-mates. There was no scoffing. This was an unconventional team, but their maverick nature was vital to their success. Twenty years on, it seems no less momentous. Media playback is not supported on this device Raith Rovers, a team from the second tier of Scottish football that had never won a major knockout competition and had been put together with £215,000 in transfer fees, against Celtic, one of the most storied and successful clubs in British football, a team that was built to achieve glory, at a cost of £5.17m. The details of Raith's victory on penalties are now part of the fabric of Scottish football. The underdogs scored first, Celtic fought back and led with six minutes left, only for Dalziel to equalise when he sent the ball into the net from close range with his nose. Extra-time passed and then both sides scored their first five spot kicks. Jason Rowbotham, now a firefighter in Plymouth, struck the first of the sudden death penalties and sent it past Gordon Marshall. Then Paul McStay stepped up. As the Celtic midfielder walked forward, Nicholl turned to his assistant, Martin Harvey, and said that Raith Rovers were one kick away from European football. McStay was idolised, smoothly accomplished and capable of rising above the clutter of so many Scottish football games. He was also the captain and this was the trophy that was expected to signal that the rebuilding work of the Fergus McCann era had been worthwhile. "Unthinkable, surely," said Jock Brown, the television commentator, "for the skipper to miss." His spot-kick was saved by the Raith Rovers goalkeeper, Scott Thomson, sparking triumphant scenes. "The aftermath was chaotic, Thommo made the save and we all pretty much just bolted in every direction, towards the fans, to each other, to the gaffer," recalled Stephen McAnespie, the Raith Rovers right-back. There was never any hope of confining the joy. The unorthodoxy of Raith was an essential quality. During pre-season training camps in Northern Ireland, Nicholl would often allow his players to have nights out socialising and cans of Guinness would sometimes be brought out on the team bus after pre-season friendlies. Nicholl was not lax, he just understood that he had drawn together a group of hardworking players who he could trust to be fully committed in training and in games - and that team bonding was also vital to maximising their potential. "We achieved a lot of good things in that period, winning the [old First Division], getting into Europe, winning the Cup," said McAnespie. "We were technically a good side, we played the ball on the floor, we were an aggressive, attack-minded team. "We had a great blend of youth and experience through the middle of the park with [Steve] Crawford, [Colin] Cameron, [Jason] Dair, [Danny] Lennon and [Gordon] Dalziel and [Ally] Graham up front. "The camaraderie was huge for us. We mixed a lot outside the changing-room, whether it was golf or a night out after a game, we had a lot of good characters and Jimmy Nic had a lot to do with that. He knew the value of a close-knit dressing-room and was a big part of the banter, but he also knew when the time was right to get tuned in and focus. "Believe it or not, we felt we could win the game before we kicked off. That was probably because we had some of us young guys that were kind of fearless and a bit naive to the magnitude of the occasion, which obviously worked out for us." Raith spent the night before the game at a hotel in Erskine, where Nicholl told the players what the starting line-up would be and then allowed them some time to relax. As they were playing darts and cards, a waiter arrived with six pints of Guinness and six pints of lager, ordered just to calm the players down. They were irrepressible, though, and the bus journey to Ibrox ended with the players - many of them Celtic fans - loudly singing Tina Turner's "Simply The Best", a song that was regularly played at Ibrox. Rovers had the home dressing-room and they had also been granted a training session the morning before on the Ibrox pitch, due to Nicholl's connections with Rangers, his former club. In the dressing-room, the players also found a bag of studs that were right for the surface, left by the Rangers kit man. In the tunnel at Ibrox before kick-off, the Raith players were joking around while the Celtic players looked grimly determined. The club had not won any major trophies in five years and the manager, Tommy Burns, was under pressure to deliver the trophy. He still found time to shake Dalziel's hand in the tunnel and wish him all the best. Back in the dressing-room after the penalty shootout, as the Celtic players tried to come to terms with the defeat, the Raith team were joined by some guests. "The first two people in behind us were John Greig and Ally McCoist," McAnespie said. "They gave us cases of Rangers label champagne. I grabbed two bottles and went straight to the front entrance, still in my kit and boots, and my family were standing right there. I handed my dad the bottles and gave them a hug and got dragged back in by the security. "I thought the crowd was going to rush the door. We went back to the hotel in Kirkcaldy, where we were met by thousands of Raith fans at the hotel with pipers, which we never expected. "We celebrated for a while, [but] a lot of the guys were so physically and emotionally drained that a lot of us ended up in bed early, shattered. Well, a little tipsy and shattered." When Nicholl had arrived at Raith as manager, on 27 November 1990, the team was mostly part-time and the players washed their own kit. Following the League Cup win, and the subsequent foray into Europe that ended with a tie against Bayern Munich, Raith were able to build two stands at Stark's Park. "It's nice to re-live it all," said McAnespie, who is now a coach in New Orleans, "especially with the other players, because at times we will remind each other about something that we had forgotten about after 20 years."	There was no room for doubt to accompany the Raith Rovers players as they set off for the League Cup final at Ibrox.
A horse-drawn chaise post retraced the route taken in 1815 from Old Royal Naval College, in Greenwich, to St James's Square, where news from Belgium was delivered to the Prince Regent. A procession to mark the occasion has also taken place in central London. Events have been staged in Belgium and the UK to remember the battle. In June 1815 - following the victory of the Duke of Wellington's allied forces over Napoleon's French army - Major Harry Percy left Belgium carrying a letter written by the Duke relaying news from the battlefield to an expectant nation. But the ship carrying the dispatch began to drift in the English Channel, resulting in the men having to row the 20 miles to shore, landing at Broadstairs, in Kent. From there, the dispatch was taken by carriage to the Prince Regent, who was at a dinner party in London. Once there, the Prince Regent initially thought Major Percy - who was still covered in blood from the fighting - was bearing bad news. But once told of Wellington's victory, guests then rushed into the street to celebrate. Actors dressed as Major Percy and Commander James White - who also helped to carry the original victory message - have retraced the original three-day journey from Waterloo. They travelled across London in horse-drawn carriage, along with replicas of two captured Imperial Eagles and Standards of the French army. An actor playing Major Percy delivered the message at the East India Club in St James's Square - where the message of victory was originally received by the Prince Regent - in front of Princess Anne. He told the Princess Royal: "I've come to you directly from the Duke of Wellington's headquarters in the village of Waterloo. "His grace, along with our Dutch and Belgian allies, and the Prussian forces as well, have met the Corsican Empire in the field and have dealt him the most shattering defeat." The eagles were then presented to the Princess Royal. The carriage then joined the Waterloo Parade along The Mall, accompanied by military bands. Julian Farrance, who played Major Percy during the commemoration, said the whole experience had been "simply astonishing". "It has been an astonishing privilege for us to be able to do this - to be able to ride the post chaise through the middle of town, but also to have started out at Waterloo and followed this journey through." The 200th anniversary of the battle has seen a series of events re-enacting important moments. On Saturday a huge re-enactment of the Battle of Waterloo took place in the same Belgian fields where Napoleon's army was defeated. Around 6,000 volunteers dressed as infantry and cavalry officers to recreate the battle and commemorate those who died. The volunteers dressed as soldiers, with 300 horses and 100 cannon, carefully re-enacted the battle for a crowd of 60,000 spectators. On Thursday, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall and Prime Minister David Cameron were among guests at a commemoration service at St Paul's Cathedral in London.	Commemorations of the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo concluded with a re-enactment of the moment news of the allied victory reached London.
The 22-year-old spent last season on loan at Southend and Luton, scoring nine goals in a combined 43 matches in League One and League Two respectively. The striker also scored for the Shrimpers in the fourth-tier play-off final victory over Wycombe while on loan at Roots Hall in 2014-15. He only made two league starts for Charlton before being let go in May. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.	Cambridge United have signed forward Joe Pigott on a one-year deal following his release by Charlton Athletic.
The 32-year-old former England right-back joined the Potters from Liverpool in 2015 and has made 50 appearances in all competitions. Johnson, whose existing contract was due to expire this summer, said the new deal was a "no-brainer". "I've really enjoyed my time as a Stoke City player so far," he added. "People made me feel really welcome from the moment I walked through the door two years ago and it's a good place to be. "I still feel as though I've got plenty to offer as a player and want to continue to help Stoke City move forward," he added. Manager Mark Hughes said that it would be "foolish" to let a player of Johnson's ability leave. "He's 32 and remains a key figure in my plans and needless to say, I'm delighted he has signed a contract extension," added the 53-year-old.	Stoke City defender Glen Johnson has signed a one-year contract extension that will keep him at the club until the summer of 2018.
The motion was tabled by Jim O'Callaghan, Fianna FÃ¡il, amid fears that the planned march could lead to violence. He wants Mr Frazer to cancel it. A rally in Dublin in 2006 was abandoned after rioting erupted. Forty-one people were arrested. A number of people, including Irish police officers, were injured. Disturbances broke out in O'Connell Street, where the rally had been due to start. Stones and fireworks were thrown after republican demonstrators mounted a counter-march.	Councillors in Dublin are due to vote later on a motion against a Love Ulster march planned for March by loyalist campaigner, Willie Frazer.
A social media campaign had proposed giving Halti mountain summit to Finland for its 100th birthday next year. The border between the two countries runs up the mountain near its peak. But Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg said that sadly she had had to turn down the idea because the country's constitution prohibited any sacrifice of Norwegian territory. Part of Halti mountain is already in Finland - and forms its current highest point - but the peak is 20m (66ft) across the border inside Norwegian territory. Campaigners had proposed moving the border to give the summit, at 1,330m (4,363 ft), to Finland, saying the change would be barely visible on the map. They had argued that the peak "would be a wonderful gift to our sister nation" to mark its independence from Russia, and not a big loss to mountainous Norway, which has much higher peaks. The campaign's Facebook page got 17,000 likes, with support from both sides of the border. But it hit upon an insurmountable legal issue. "Border adjustments between countries raise challenging legal problems, among them linked to the Norwegian constitution," Ms Solberg wrote to Svein Leiros, the mayor of the town of Kaafjord in northern Norway, who supported the campaign. Norway's  1814 constitution stipulates that the country is "indivisible" - and apparently not even an area the size of a football pitch can be split off. "We will instead consider another suitable gift to Finland on its anniversary," the prime minister added.	Norway has rejected a plan to give its neighbour Finland a mountain to mark the centenary of its independence.
The group are due to be brought to a hostel in the countryside near Great Torrington, Devon on Sunday or Monday. The children will be transported from Croydon, south London, where they were taken from the Jungle camp by a private security company. The Home Office said they are unaccompanied, vulnerable children. It is not clear if the children are among a group that arrived under the "Dubs amendment" which grants refuge to particularly vulnerable individuals, such as those who are unaccompanied and without family ties in the UK. The purpose of the temporary facility is to provide a safe and welcoming place before the children are reunited with family members or moved to other parts of the country, Devon Country Council said. The council said it is working with the police, NHS and other local authorities as part of the "emergency response". "These will be vulnerable young people," Councillor James McInnes said. "They will be frightened and they will be exhausted, and we as an authority have a statutory responsibility to support those that present in Devon." Dozens of private security guards will accompany the group. A source told the BBC most of those expected in Devon are over 16 years old. Geoffrey Cox, Conservative MP for Torridge and West Devon, said the move will not be a "permanent institution". "The majority of the children will only be here for a few days," he said. "They will be under 18 and there is no question of anyone over 18 coming." The Home Office declined to comment on the details of the transfer, but added the children were often traumatised and their privacy should be respected as they received support to rebuild their lives.	Up to 70 child migrants from the Jungle camp in Calais are expected to arrive at a temporary Home Office "respite facility", the BBC has learnt.
After decades of struggle for a more equal society, it is now presumed that every disabled child will get the opportunity to attend a mainstream school where possible. However, what does real inclusion mean in practice and is the system a success? Or are disabled children drifting to the back of the class? In my documentary Am I Included? - which is being shown this week at 19:30 on Wednesday on BBC One Scotland - I get the opportunity of putting this question to not only the professionals, but also to the students and their families. Thinking back to my own experience of school in the late 1960s and 1970s, things were very different for disabled people. There were no technological solutions that would help, like talking computers, video magnifiers and the myriad of phone apps which can tell you colours, count your money, give you travel directions and so on. The school buildings were generally inaccessible for many youngsters with physical disabilities. It wasn't until the last 15 years, when we began building new schools, that accessibility actually improved. So it's much easier today to include children with disabilities into their local schools, which should enable a fairer education. However, is being included just about being able to get in the front door? Does this mean that you are properly included in all aspects of school life? The issues, of course, are extremely complicated. It does come down to a long list of factors: the disability itself and what impact it has on the child; how they are assessed; the attitudes of teachers and all the staff and children; and the school ethos. Do the teachers have experience of teaching life skills to a child with disabilities? Is the funding there to make it happen? Plus, and this is really important, is the child actually thriving within the school? As a blind person, I feel I can speak with some experience, as I've experienced three different kinds of education systems: mainstream primary education; a specialist secondary school for a range of children with various disabilities; and, latterly, a college education aimed exclusively at visually impaired students. The Royal National College for the Blind in Hereford was the best for me. It is an institution aimed not only at academia, but also towards developing a person who can function as independently as possible in their own community. They focused on mobility, daily living skills, social skills and academic qualifications. They even taught me Braille which, for an 18-year-old, was far too late - I should have been taught how to use this from the age of five! It was the lack of support from a peer group which I missed throughout my primary and secondary education. It was not until the age of 18 that I met up with other people who had a visual impairment like mine. Finding out about the world with other visually impaired people was essential for me to understand my own value. It helped me understand that my experience of the world could be understood by my peers. I fitted in with ease and we had a common bond which made us stronger. Fundamentally, I received specialist input from people who understood my disability. Clearly there are plenty of children with disabilities who do very well in mainstream schools across Scotland, but there are also plenty who are struggling. I know the documentary will raise more questions than it answers. If it does nothing else, I hope it reopens the debate. Am I Included? will be broadcast on BBC One Scotland at 19:30, and later available on the BBC iPlayer.	We have now had 16 years of mainstream education for children with disabilities in Scotland.
The 28-year-old left Rovers after their National League promotion final defeat by Grimsby earlier this month. He made 33 league appearances this season, scoring six goals from defence, and has previously played for the likes of Cambridge and Mansfield. "I spoke to Gary last week and was delighted to join a great club, moving in the right direction," he said. "There was interest elsewhere but when I had a good couple of hour chat with Gary last week and was happy with his vision."	Left-back James Jennings has joined promoted Cheltenham Town from Gloucestershire rivals Forest Green.
Edwards, 23, has scored three goals in 127 games for the Shrimps since joining from Blackburn Rovers in May 2014, with two in 50 appearances last season.

Hartley, 28, headed home from a 91st-minute corner to send the Pilgrims to Wembley for the first time in 20 years. "I've never experienced anything like that, it's the biggest moment of my career so far," he told BBC Sport. "I was sat in the dressing room and the boys were celebrating and I was just thinking 'what's happened?'" Having drawn the first leg 2-2 at Fratton Park, the Pilgrims - who finished fifth in League two despite having led the league by five points in November - had almost all the chances in the second leg at Home Park. But the game seemed to be heading for extra time until former Stevenage and Hartlepool defender Hartley came up with the winner in front of the Argyle end. "I remember connecting with the ball and it hit the back of the boy's head and hit my head again and went in," he said. "Then I woke up and there was some big bald guy kissing me in the face. "We set up perfectly to nullify Portsmouth's threat and I think we look like a real good outfit. "I don't think Accrington or AFC Wimbledon will fancy playing us at Wembley."	Peter Hartley says scoring the injury-time winner for Plymouth Argyle in the League Two play-off semi-final against Portsmouth is his greatest moment.
The latest Markit/CIPS services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 52.7 last month, down from January's reading of 55.6. Any figure above 50 means expansion, but the rise in service sector activity was the weakest since March 2013. The service sector accounts for more than three-quarters of the UK economy. Surveys from Markit/CIPS earlier in the week put the manufacturing sector's PMI at 50.8 and construction at 54.2. "The weaker increase in services activity mainly reflected a slower expansion in the volume of incoming new business," the survey said. Markit chief economist Chris Williamson added: "Survey responses reveal that firms are worried about signs of faltering demand, but boardrooms have also become unsettled by concerns regarding the increased risk of 'Brexit', financial market volatility and weak economic growth at home and abroad." He added that the extent of the slowdown would come as a "shock" to policymakers and would put an end to talk of a possible interest rate rise. Mr Williamson described February's three PMI readings as "a triple whammy of disappointing survey news". Last week, official figures confirmed that the UK economy grew 0.5% in the final three months of 2015, with the services sector highlighted as the key factor driving growth. The Office for National Statistics said the "buoyancy" of services had offset the "relative sluggishness" of the rest of the UK economy. Signs of weakening growth in the UK economy have pushed back estimates of when the Bank of England might begin to raise interest rates. Commenting on the latest PMI survey, Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, said: "The May Bank of England meeting had previously been seen as a possible time for a rate hike. The volatility of global markets and the self-inflicted wound of the EU referendum put paid to that months ago. "We still believe, however, that some measures that foresee the Bank of England holding rates at 0.5% until 2020 are little short of absurd." Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the PMI readings would provide "plenty of food for thought" for the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee. He added: "Members will have to judge the degree to which the surveys are flagging a genuine slowdown in activity growth, or merely reacting to the negative headlines since the start of the year. In reality, growth may be softening, but perhaps not as sharply as the survey data suggest." Meanwhile, a similar survey indicated that eurozone businesses had their worst month for more than a year in February, bolstering the case for more monetary policy easing by the European Central Bank. Markit's final composite PMI, which is regarded as a good guide to growth, fell to 53 last month from January's 53.6 - its lowest reading since the start of 2015. However, that was better than the preliminary reading of 52.7 and well above the 50 mark that denotes growth.	The UK's dominant services sector weakened in February, registering its slowest rate of growth for nearly three years, a survey has indicated.
The Czech world number 233 edged Estonia's 99th-ranked Kontaveit - who beat Britain's Heather Watson in the first round - 6-4 7-6 (8-6). Vondrousova had beaten Czech compatriot and world number 18 Barbora Strycova in the semi-final. Sunday's victory moves her close to the top 100 for the first time. Croatia's Borna Coric saved five match points to defeat Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber 5-7 7-6 (7-3) 7-5 to clinch his first ATP title at the Grand Prix Hassan II in Marrakech.

Marketa Vondrousova, a 17-year-old qualifier, beat Anett Kontaveit in the final of the Biel Bienne Open in Switzerland to win her first WTA title.
Shankaracharya Swaroopanand's comments came two days after the Shani Shingnapur temple in Maharashtra state let women into the inner sanctum. For centuries, the temple had been open only to men. Last month, the Mumbai high court affirmed the right of women to enter and pray inside all temples. Women's activists had led protests demanding entry specifically to the Lord Shani shrine. "Women entered Shani temple's inner sanctum," news agency ANI quoted the 94-year-old as saying on Monday. "The women are worshipping Shani in the temple. By doing so, Shani's eyes would fall on women and this would result in increase of rape incidents." Women were kept out of the Shani Shingnapur temple for nearly 400 years and temple officials, in the past, had claimed that the ban was actually "to protect women since Shani emits radiation which can harm them and cause deformity in a foetus if a pregnant woman enters the temple". Last year, temple priests carried out an elaborate ritual cleansing after a woman managed to gain entry inside and offer prayers. The temple authorities relented after last month's Mumbai high court ruling that women had a fundamental right to enter temples, and said those trying to prevent them would be handed a six-month jail term. Several temples in India preserve the tradition of barring entry to women and in recent months, courts have been considering legal challenges to the policy. Shankaracharya Swaroopanand's statement has caused outrage in India with many taking to social media to criticise him: There were a few messages of support too:	A Hindu religious leader's comment that allowing women into a shrine devoted to Lord Shani (Saturn) will increase rapes has drawn criticism.

In an extended interview with BBC Wales health correspondent Owain Clarke, Dr Goodall said hospitals might make the decision not to schedule surgery in the first place to focus on "front door pressures" during the peak winter months. Two hospitals, Morriston in Swansea and the Princess of Wales in Bridgend, have already cancelled some surgical procedures until after Christmas.	The new chief executive of the Welsh NHS has told BBC Wales winter pressures could force hospitals to cancel operations.
The Wainwright Society, formed after his death in 1991, has chosen Fix the Fells as its main beneficiary for 2017. Up to Â£20,000 will be used to repair badly eroded Long Stile, the final ascent on to High Street summit between Ullswater and Haweswater. A Fix the Fells spokesman said the group was "delighted" to be chosen. Derek Cockell, secretary of The Wainwright Society, said: "Next year is the 60th anniversary of Wainwright's Far Eastern Fells book, which came out in 1957. "We approached Fix the Fells and asked them if they had any paths that they were going to repair in that area and they told us about Long Stile which of course Wainwright pioneered as a wonderful route up High Street." Fix the Fells, which repairs eroded and damaged footpaths in the Lake District, is expected to complete the work in 2018 with the help of National Trust rangers and Lake District National Park Authority volunteers. Mr Wainwright, who was born in 1907, was a significant figure for Cumbria, compiling drawings of 214 fells over more than 10 years of exploration in the 1950s and 60s. The Wainwright Society was formed to keep alive the things he promoted through his guidebooks.	A Lake District path expert fell walker Alfred Wainwright described as the "connoisseur's route" is to be repaired thanks to a charity set up in his name.
The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) says there is a shortage of midwives and a fall in students and any future cuts will risk the quality of services. The Welsh government said the number of midwifery training places commissioned rose again this year. It also said all maternity units must meet recommendations on the number of midwives needed for safe services. It is the second year the RCM has carried out a State of Maternity Services report across Wales, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. "Wales saw a trimming of training numbers in 2011/12 compared to the previous year. It is for this reason, and the fall in midwife numbers there, that the RCM is putting Wales on watch," the report said. "We are not yet ringing the alarm bell, but we are poised to do so; decision-makers in Wales must turn this deteriorating situation around." It went on that the the shortage of midwives that has emerged needs to be "eliminated without delay". "The government in Cardiff should act now," the report said. "The shortage we have identified in Wales should be easily eliminated - and we call on the government in Wales to do just that. "Given the emerging shortage of midwives in Wales, the number of student midwife places needs to be sustained; any further cuts would put the future quality of maternity services at risk." Midwife numbers fell in Wales in the last annual survey in 2011, where figures were 12% lower than in 2008, and the RCM said it was the third year in a row in which the number of midwives working in the NHS in Wales was cut. "Between 2001 and 2011 whilst the number of babies born jumped by just short of 5,000, the number of full-time equivalent midwives rose by just 35. "In last year's State of Maternity Services report we reported on an emerging shortage of midwives in Wales. We believe that this remained in 2011; whilst the number of births dropped a little, the number of midwives dropped too." However, Wales has seen a 34% drop in births to girls aged under 16. In England, the number of NHS midwives has continued to climb because of the UK government's good work, according to the report. A Welsh government spokesperson said:  "The numbers of midwifery training places commissioned has increased again this year from last year's numbers. "Decisions about training places are based on what the NHS needs to maintain services, service development, the numbers and age profile of staff and the drop-out rate from the courses. Clearly, plans also take into account the student midwives who are already in training and when these are expected to graduate and enter the workforce. "NHS organisations are responsible for ensuring that they have the appropriate number of staff and skill mix to meet fluctuating demand. Since 1999, the maternity workforce, including midwives and midwifery support workers, has increased by 12% in Wales. "We require all maternity units in Wales to comply with Birth Rate Plus - as recommended by the Royal College of Midwives - on the number of midwives required to deliver safe services."	Deteriorating maternity services in Wales must be turned around without delay, midwives have warned.
Jacqueline McPhie, 46, took the money while vice president for finance at Altus Intervention in Aberdeen between March 2013 and April 2014. McPhie, of Arbroath, admitted embezzlement and was jailed for three years and four months in July. At the High Court in Edinburgh, she was ordered to pay back £587,434 through her "realisable assets." She was given six months to pay the confiscation order. McPhie diverted money from the business, which supplies equipment for North Sea oil and gas projects, to fund her lifestyle. She bought an £80,000 Range Rover, and spent more than £60,000 on a new garage and driveway, £52,000 on a kitchen and £30,000 on a summer house in her garden. McPhie had previously been given 300 hours of community service 16 years ago for stealing £250,000 from previous employers.	A woman jailed for embezzling more than £1.3m from her employers has been ordered to pay back nearly £600,000.
Security camera footage showed the suspect taking a weapon out of his backpack and shooting. Israeli security forces have launched a massive manhunt for the gunman, cordoning off areas of the city. The incident took place in Dizengoff Street, a busy part of the city centre filled with bars and cafes. It was not immediately clear what motivated the shooting, which follows a wave of Palestinian attacks against Israelis over the past few months. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told the BBC: "It's not clear what the background of the incident is, if it's a terrorist attack or if it's criminal-related." Four of the wounded had suffered serious injuries, he said. Undercover units and counter-terrorism units were working in different areas of Tel Aviv, Mr Rosenfeld said, adding that no specific warning of an attack had been received. Israeli media are reporting that the attacker has been identified as an Israeli Arab from northern Israel. The Times of Israel reported, citing police sources, that his father had recognised his son in security footage and called police. While 1 January is not New Year's Day in the Jewish state, Friday afternoon would be the peak of the weekend and this was a party area of Tel Aviv. The city tends to be slightly more remote from the political tensions and violence affecting other parts of Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. There has been speculation that if the bar was popular with the gay community, it may have been a hate crime. It remains a possibility that there was some kind of link to organised crime. But until the perpetrator is captured, it is not clear what the motive may have been. A spokesman for the Israeli ambulance service, Zaki Heller, said people inside and outside the bar had been hit: "Some of the wounded were inside the pub. Three of them were lying unconscious and the rest were on the sidewalk [pavement]," he said. Footage from a neighbouring food store shows the gunman - who appears to be a young man, wearing protective glasses or sunglasses, and dressed in dark clothes - choosing dried fruits or nuts. Moments later, he returns the items, gets an assault rifle out of his bag, leaves the shop and can be seen opening fire from near the doorway. He is believed to have made off on foot. Afterwards, broken glass could be seen on the pavement outside the bar and a nearby cafe which was also targeted. Osnat David, who owns a nearby hair ,said she and her customers had hidden while the shooting took place. "We were shaking," she said. "There were about eight of us, hiding in the storage room." The shooting took place at around 15:00 local time (13:00 GMT) on Friday. As of 23 December, at least 21 Israelis had been killed in the recent violence, most of them in stabbings and shooting attacks by Palestinians. At least 131 Palestinians have also been killed. More than half were said by Israel to be attackers. Others have been killed in clashes with Israeli forces.	Two people have died and and seven others have been injured after a gunman opened fire with an automatic rifle at a bar in Tel Aviv, Israeli police say.
The rock is an eroded volcano that lies 260 miles (418km) west of the Western Isles and is only 30m (100ft) wide and 21m (70ft) high above the sea. The Nato documents report how the UK claimed Rockall in 1955. The government feared that it could be used by "hostile agents" as a place to monitor the Hebrides Rocket Range. A small team of military personnel was taken to Rockall by the Royal Navy in September 1955 to claim as UK territory. A Union Flag was raised and a plaque installed on the rock. In the documents, it says: "This decision of the UK government was connected with the fact that the UK government had recently decided to set up a guided missile range in South Uist, in the Outer Hebrides. "The island of Rockall was uninhabited but this government wished to guard against the possibility of hostile agents installing themselves on the island in order to observe the effects of the tests on the South Uist range." People have stayed on Rockall, though only temporarily, in the past, including in 1997 when three campaigners from Greenpeace managed to climb on to the rock. They lived on Rockall for 42 days and renamed it Waveland in protest at exploration of new oil and gas reserves in the surrounding seabed. In 2014, a Scots adventurer broke the record for occupying the remote North Atlantic rock. Adventurer Nick Hancock survived on there for 43 days, beating the previous record held by three Greenpeace campaigners who lived there for 42 days. The time also beat the previous solo record of 40 days set by Tom McClean in 1985. Mr Hancock celebrated achieving the solo record by popping a small bottle of champagne while also sending a tweet with a message to veteran adventurer Mr McClean, of Morar in the west Highlands. His message was simply: "Sorry Tom."	Declassified documents reveal concerns of the UK government 60 years ago that Rockall could become a base for spying on a missile test site.
The bodies were found on Sunday, but no identities have been released. Two people have been reported missing from a sushi restaurant hit by the blast: Nicholas Figueroa, who was on a date there, and a worker, Moises Lucon. A further 22 people were injured in the explosion and subsequent fire, four critically. Utility inspectors had declared plumbing and gas work inside one of the buildings faulty just an hour before the explosion, locking the line to ensure it would not be used and then leaving, officials said. The blast that followed soon after left heaps of bricks and mangled debris across the street in Manhattan's East Village. Mr Figueroa's date, who is being treated in hospital, remembers only stumbling out of the restaurant before losing consciousness. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said officials would investigate whether anyone had improperly tapped the gas supply prior to the blast.	Two bodies been found at the site of a massive gas explosion that flattened three buildings in New York on Thursday.

Owen and Karl Oyston sued fan David Ragozzino for Â£150,000 over a post on website Another View From the Tower. The 32-year-old said he had "limited financial means" and feared what would happen should the Oystons win the case. The judge at Manchester Civil Justice Centre gave him 21 days to respond to the claim. The application to default hearing was brought by the Oystons on the grounds Mr Ragozzino had failed to file a defence in time to their action. He was supported at the court by dozens of Blackpool fans, who carried banners that criticised the Oystons' running of the club. On Friday, fellow fan Stephen Sharpe apologised to the Oystons over his online comments, withdrawing his posts after accepting they were "false, defamatory and, in some cases, threatening". On Saturday, about 1,000 fans staged a demonstration before the club's home game with Brighton, calling for the Oystons to relinquish control of the club.	A Blackpool football fan who is accused of libelling the club's owners on the internet has told a court he has "never written anything defamatory".
An off-duty inspector found the girl in Grange Lane, Lye, near Pedmore Technology College, Stourbridge. Police are seeking a light grey or blue vehicle in connection with the crash. Sgt Steve Newbury said: "It's shocking to think someone could leave a child seriously hurt in the street, drive off and make no effort to get her medical treatment." Updates on this story and more from the Black Country He added: "Clearly this is distressing at any time for the girl's family, but to happen just days before Christmas is truly heartbreaking." The girl suffered a fractured skull and internal injuries in the crash, thought to have happened just before 22:00 GMT on Thursday. A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said it was clear "the 15-year-old had multiple serious injuries" and there was no car at the location. "She was treated at the scene by ambulance staff before being taken to Russells Hall Hospital." Her condition on arrival there was described as critical but stable.	A 15-year-old girl has been critically injured in a suspected hit-and-run in the Black Country.
The 39-year-old Englishman has not played in a competitive match since the World Championship quarter-finals in April, and has not entered next week's UK Snooker Championship. "I do want a place within the sport, and I'm trying to fathom what that place is," he told Eurosport. "I'm trying different things." O'Sullivan also opted not to defend his title at last week's Champion of Champions in Coventry, which Neil Robertson won. He is currently playing exhibition matches. "It's been tough at times but I truly feel I have a good idea of what it is I want," he said. "I don't want the pressure of being the top man in snooker any more. I feel that should be left to the new generation of players. "It's funny really. I'm actually enjoying my practice more then ever. I play for fun now. I still try to be the best I can be, but I don't have to be so serious about being so committed to it. "Me and my mates play a lot these days."	Five-time world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan says he no longer has any interest in being snooker's "top man" but has not retired.
Sunderland's Giaccherini slotted home in the first half after collecting Leonardo Bonucci's superb long pass. Southampton's Pelle sealed the win in injury time with an emphatic volley following an incisive break. Belgium were very disappointing, with Romelu Lukaku and Divock Origi wasteful in front of goal. Everton forward Lukaku curled over from the edge of the box with just the keeper to beat while Liverpool's Origi missed two opportunities to head his side level. Before the tournament began some pundits condemned this Italy squad for a lack of quality, and even coach Antonio Conte said: "It isn't a good time for our football." The soon-to-be-Chelsea boss added: "It's important the squad has a good spirit. I work a lot at this." On the evidence of this game, that is not the only thing he has worked at. Italy's triumph was a result of superior organisation and discipline against 11 Belgian individuals who appear to possess, on paper at least, the greater talent. Both sides now face games against the Republic of Ireland and Sweden, who drew 1-1 in the Group E opener earlier on Monday. With 16 of 24 teams progressing from the group stage, Italy took a huge step towards advancing with victory against their likeliest challengers. Italy have won this competition once, in 1968, and finished runners-up twice - most recently in 2012, when they were demolished 4-0 by Spain in the final. While the current Azzurri side went unbeaten through qualifying, winning seven of their 10 matches, they compare unfavourably with the side of four years ago, lacking the calm, creative brilliance of Andrea Pirlo in midfield and an attacking spearhead to adequately replace a faded Mario Balotelli. What they do have is a meticulous and tactically astute coach in the Chelsea-bound Conte and a stubborn Juventus-centric defence. Such a foundation allowed them to limit and frustrate Belgium, leaving them vulnerable to one piece of ruthless counter-attacking brilliance - which Bonucci's 50-yard, defence-splitting pass and Giaccherini's cool finish provided. The second half would have been more comfortable for Italy had a second goal been scored from an unmarked position by Pelle, who also had a second header saved by Thibaut Courtois after the break. However, Conte's imperious rearguard held firm before Pelle volleyed home a neat chipped cross from Antonio Candreva. Despite only having qualified for one major tournament in the past 14 years, Belgium came to France as Europe's top-ranked side and one of the favourites to triumph in Paris on 10 July. Their status is built around the attacking potential and club-forged reputation of individuals such as Kevin de Bruyne, Eden Hazard and Lukaku, as opposed to consistent evidence of a cohesive international team. However, the Red Devils did little to suggest they are ready to convert this promise into something concrete on the big stage. They were pedestrian in the first half, failing to get in behind the Italian backline, with De Bruyne particularly isolated. They upped the speed after the break but still struggled to test Gianluigi Buffon, with Lukaku curling over a good chance and substitute Origi spurning two glorious headed opportunities. Equally as worrying for Belgium was the performance of their defence. Already without the injured Vincent Kompany, they looked particularly vulnerable with Jan Vertonghen deployed at left-back instead of alongside his Tottenham colleague Toby Alderweireld in the centre. Italy coach Antonio Conte: "What we demonstrated tonight is that there were two teams who played exciting football, with changes at both ends. It proves that nothing is already written in football, and it is on the field where you have to make your point. "In a tournament like this, you need an alchemy, of people who get on well together and the biggest satisfaction for me tonight is to see how happy they all were, also those on the bench. There's a very good spirit in this squad." Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois: "Now we have to win the other two matches and be a better team. Italy outclassed us in organisation, and tactically they were the best team." BBC pundit and former Italy striker Gianluca Vialli: "I don't want to brag, but we were almost perfect. We dominated the game, we showed desire and commitment and we played like a team. We had a perfect game plan." BBC pundit and ex-England defender Rio Ferdinand: "That was a perfect example of one playing like a team, the other like a group of individuals. What was so impressive is the way they can go from defence to attack so quickly." Italy face Sweden in Toulouse at 14:00 BST on Friday with Belgium taking on the Republic of Ireland in Bordeaux at 14:00 the following day. Match ends, Belgium 0, Italy 2.

The Republican Party is too badly divided. His rhetoric is too incendiary. Republican voters may be "idiots", but the general public is wiser. The US electoral map, which places a premium on winning key high-population "swing" states, is tilted against the Republican Party. About that last point. On Tuesday a survey of three key swing states - Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania - revealed a virtual dead heat between the two likely standard-bearers. Those states - which account for 67 electoral votes - all went for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Add them to the states Republican Mitt Romney carried in 2012, and it delivers 273 electoral votes - three more than the 270 necessary to win the presidency. Throw in a national tracking poll released on Wednesday that has Donald Trump surging to within striking distance of Hillary Clinton, and it's a recipe for acute hyperventilation on the part of Democrats. Butâ€¦ butâ€¦ butâ€¦ cooler-heads respond. The Reuters/Ipsos national poll, which has Mrs Clinton ahead 41% to Mr Trump's 40% and 19% undecided, was conducted online. That Quinnipiac swing-state poll oversampled white voters - a demographic group that is more inclined to Republicans. In addition, it doesn't represent that big a shift from the group's battleground-state poll from last autumn, which undermines the theory that Mr Trump's support is growing. The news caused election guru Nate Silver to go on a Twitter tirade, asserting that it's way too early to start gaming out the state-by-state electoral map based on opinion polls. "The election will go through a lot of twists and turns, and polls are noisy," he writes. "Don't sweat individual polls or short-term fluctuations." Sweating polls is what US pundits and commentators do, however. And at the very least, signs that Mr Trump is within reach of Mrs Clinton should cast doubts on the early predictions that the Democrats will win in the autumn by historic, Goldwater-esque margins. Mr Trump has a pathway to the presidency. He may not get there. It is not the most likely outcome. But it's real. That linchpin of a Trump victory centres on the so-called Rust Belt - states like the aforementioned Pennsylvania and Ohio, as well as Michigan and Wisconsin. Even if Florida, due to its rapidly growing Hispanic population, goes to Mrs Clinton, Mr Trump could still win if he sweeps those states. It's a strategy that Mr Trump already appears to understand. "We'll win places that a lot of people say you're not going to win, that as a Republican you can't win," Mr Trump said at an April rally in Indiana. "Michigan is a great example; nobody else will go to Michigan. We're going to be encamped in Michigan because I think I can win it." The challenge for Mr Trump is that the mid-west, particularly, Wisconsin and Michigan, have served as a Democratic firewall that Republicans have been unable to penetrate since 1988. "These states constantly intrigue Republican presidential strategists because the Democratic advantage in them depends largely on an act of political levitation: the ability to consistently win a slightly greater share of working-class white voters here than almost anywhere else," writes the Atlantic's Ronald Brownstein. If Mr Trump is to find success, then, he likely will have to finally win over this stubborn portion of the mid-western electorate or, perhaps, energise what Sean Trende of RealClear Politics has called the "missing white voters". Trende points to a national drop-off more than 3.5 million white voters from the elections of 2008 to 2012, when population growth should have resulted in an increase of 1.5 million. These voters, he theorised, were largely working-class whites who had previously supported iconoclasts like Ross Perot, the 1992 anti-free-trade independent candidate. It's the type of voter that Mr Trump, with his populist economic pitch, has been turning out in the Republican primaries. In 2012 Mr Obama beat Mr Romney by roughly 5 million votes. If Mr Trump can bring those disaffected white voters back to the polls in 2016, it would cut into that margin. If Mrs Clinton is unable to produce the record-setting turnout among young and minority voters that Mr Obama achieved, the gap shrinks further still. That's a lot of "if's", of course. Young and minority voters - particularly Hispanics - may yet turn out to the polls in high numbers, if only to cast ballots against Mr Trump. There are already indications of record-setting Hispanic voter registration in places like California. There's also the risk that Mr Trump's reliance on populist rhetoric and controversial views on immigration could lead white-collar voters to favour Mrs Clinton. For every disaffected member of the working-class he brings in, he could lose a suburban mum or college-educated businessman. Even giving Mr Trump the benefit of the doubt, and viewing the recent polls as a trend and not a blip, there are still more electoral scenarios that end up with Mrs Clinton in the White House come 2017. For Mr Trump, the political stars have to re-align in his favour. For Mrs Clinton, a general-election status quo likely means victory.	In the week since Donald Trump effectively secured the Republican presidential nomination, a great deal of ink and airtime have been devoted to explaining why he will have a difficult time winning the presidency in the autumn.
In a statement (in French) it said it was "worried about the continued worsening of the situation". On Saturday, Turkey began shelling the militia, which it says is linked to the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). The fighters, the YPG militia based in Syria, have rejected Turkey's demand to leave areas it has seized, saying Islamists would return if it left. Turkey's assault is a new thread in an already-complex conflict that has drawn in competing regional powers. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu insisted on Sunday that Turkey "will not permit the [Kurdish militia] to carry out aggressive acts". "Our security forces gave the necessary response and will continue to do so," Mr Davutoglu said. Syria has also condemned the Turkish action as a violation of its sovereignty and asked the UN Security Council to intervene. France also called on the Syrian regime and its allies to stop their bombardments "across the whole of the country". France said priority should be given to implementing an agreement reached in Munich this week on ceasing hostilities, and the fight against so-called Islamic State (IS) group. Almost five years of civil war in Syria have led to the deaths of more than 250,000 people. More than 11 million people have been displaced. How Putin is succeeding in Syria Displaced Syrians struggle to survive Syria: The story of the conflict Turkey v Islamic State v the Kurds: What's going on? Attempts to broker a peace deal have repeatedly failed, but on Thursday, world leaders agreed to work towards a so-called cessation of hostilities in Syria within a week. The US and Russian presidents agreed in a "frank and business-like" phone call to work more closely to achieve this, the Kremlin said on Sunday. Russia, an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has been carrying out air strikes since September against what it terms "terrorists". Among the targets shelled by Turkey is the Menagh airbase, which was seized by the YPG on Thursday from Syrian Islamist rebels. The YPG controls much of Syria's northern border with Turkey. Syria's war hardly needs a new front, but another has now opened up. Ankara sees the Kurdish PYD party and its YPG militia as terrorist organisations. It's worried that weapons are seeping over the border from Syria to the PKK, with which Turkey has renewed its armed conflict since a ceasefire broke down last year. Washington rejects Ankara's view that the PYD is a terrorist organisation, seeing it instead as an effective ally against so-called Islamic State (IS). That has caused rifts between the two Nato allies and is hampering international peace talks. Syria is the stage for several proxy wars, and Turkey has just started another, going after its Kurdish nemesis there and vowing to stop the PYD from cementing control of northern Syria. Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency said Turkish forces shot at Kurdish fighters inside Syria on Sunday after coming under fire themselves. Ankara sees the group as being linked with Kurdish guerrillas from PKK, which has waged a campaign against security forces in Turkey for decades. In other developments: Under the agreed cessation of hostilities plan, efforts will be made to try to make urgent aid deliveries to besieged and hard-to-reach areas in Syria. Steps will also be taken to work towards an eventual ceasefire and implementation of a UN-backed plan for political transition in Syria. The halt would not apply to the battle against the jihadists of IS and al-Nusra Front. However, neither the Syrian government nor the rebels were involved in the deal and both have since vowed to continue fighting. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said on Friday that he intended to retake "the whole country" from rebels - a statement the US government said was "deluded". Syrian government forces, backed by Russian air strikes, have almost encircled rebels in parts of the northern city of Aleppo. Also on Sunday, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev repeated a warning that any foreign ground operation in Syria would lead to "a full-fledged, long war". Turkey has said its troops and forces from Saudi Arabia might participate in a ground operation against IS.	France's foreign ministry has urged Turkey to end its assault on Kurdish fighters in northern Syria.
Mr Trump's 2018 budget blueprint reportedly includes a 37% spending cut for the State Department and US Agency for International Development (USAID). He will set out to convince Congress of his proposal in his first address to a joint session on Tuesday night. But Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said his plan is "dead on arrival". "It's not going to happen. It would be a disaster. If you take soft power off the table then you're never going to win the war," Senator Graham said. Soft power is an American term that refers to diplomatic tools such as foreign aid and humanitarian relief. "What's most disturbing about the cut to the State Department's budget is it shows a lack of understanding of what it takes to win the war," Senator Graham continued. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also said Mr Trump's reported deep cuts to the State Department would "probably not" pass Congress. The Republican-controlled Congress must approve any federal spending. To the White House, foreign aid might seem like an easy target for cuts, but those who protect the country think otherwise. In their letter to lawmakers more than 120 former military officers quoted the Defence Secretary James Mattis from his days as a field commander: "If you don't fully fund the State Department then I need to buy more ammunition." They argued that strengthening diplomacy and development were critical to preventing conflict. International assistance in the State Department budget does more than respond to humanitarian needs, it also supports policy goals. For example, it supplements the military fight against the so-called Islamic State through programmes to disrupt the group's financing and recruitment, and to stabilise communities where IS has been driven out. There's money to address the underlying causes of migration from Central America, and to strengthen allies such as Afghanistan and Ukraine. The former Secretary of State John Kerry was known to make a strong case for increasing the department's financing, (which at $50bn makes up just 1% of the entire budget). The new Secretary Rex Tillerson will have to fight simply to keep what he has, or the State Department will be marginalised in an administration focused on the military. The president released a budget proposal on Monday calling for a $54bn (Â£43bn) boost to military spending. This would be paid for, according to the plan, by gutting other programmes including foreign aid and the environmental agency. The White House also plans to reduce spending for the State Department and USAID,  say US media reports, which together received an estimated $50.1bn during the current fiscal year, or a little more than 1% of the total federal budget. More than 120 retired generals have signed a letter urging Congress not to cut funding for diplomacy and foreign aid. The letter said: "As you and your colleagues address the federal budget for Fiscal Year 2018, we write as retired three and four star flag and general officers from all branches of the armed services to share our strong conviction that elevating and strengthening diplomacy and development alongside defense are critical to keeping America safe." Development assistance would probably be hardest hit while staff reductions would see fewer security contractors at diplomatic missions abroad, the AP reported, citing officials familiar with the proposal. The Office of Management and Budget has not yet said where overall reductions would occur. The Republican pushback over Mr Trump's reported plan comes as the president is set to deliver his first major speech to Congress since taking office. An address to Congress is a different kind of presidential speech. Will the American public see a different Donald Trump? If history is any guide, that seems unlikely. Every time there has been talk of a pivot or shift of focus for candidate Trump, or president-elect Trump, or President Trump, the end result has been the same Donald Trump as always - blustering and belligerent, unvarnished and unapologetic. Mr Trump would be well-served to take a different tack tonight, however. While he's spent his first month in office in a blizzard of activity, issuing executive orders and squelching controversies, there's been little progress with his agenda in Congress. Top-line items like tax cuts and healthcare reform will be heavy legislative lifts with a baulky conservative caucus in the House and a narrow Republican majority in the Senate, requiring presidential leadership of a kind not yet demonstrated by Mr Trump. Recent opinion polls have shown the president's standing with the public improving after a dismal first few weeks, but any progress can quickly evaporate if his "man of action" bravado runs headfirst into congressional obstinance. Tuesday night's speech is the president's first major opportunity to avoid that outcome. He is expected to set out in greater detail his plans to cut spending and boost the economy as well as offer an "optimistic vision" about the "renewal of the American spirit", a senior White House official told the BBC. At least one Democrat has said he would refuse to shake Mr Trump's hand before the speech, bucking a longstanding bipartisan tradition in presidential first addresses to Congress. Representative Eliot Engel, a top New York Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he would not shake Mr Trump's hand as he enters the chamber, citing the president's attacks on media and refusal to work with Congress. It will be the first time Mr Engel has not sought a centre aisle seat to shake the president's hand in his 29 years serving in the House.	Republicans are lining up against President Donald Trump's proposed budget cuts to the State Department, hours before his address to Congress.
Mary Burrows, who was chief executive of Betsi Cadwaladr health board, moved from Colwyn Bay, Conwy county, to London two months ago. She is staying with her son while she receives treatment for breast cancer. "Treatments that have not been approved by Nice are not routinely available in Wales," a health board statement said. A £200m-a-year cancer drug fund was set up in England in 2011. There is no similar fund in Wales. Mrs Burrows said her consultant in Wales advised her to go to the Royal Marsden Hospital, Surrey, for the next stage of her treatment because the drug she needed was not available in Wales. She called the situation "distressing," adding: "A lot of people can't just move their family to another UK nation. There needs to be a debate across all of the UK about how we fund these treatments. "Not just cancer treatments; advanced technologies and surgeries coming through that people will want to access." Mrs Burrows left her role with the health board last January. She said she had "arguments with myself" about the fairness of the Welsh government policy and if having a cancer drug fund takes resources from people with other illnesses. Mrs Burrows' husband died two years ago of advanced melanoma after he was also unable to get treatment in Wales, she said. Now she is calling for more investment in the NHS "across the board". A Betsi Cadwaladr spokeswoman said: "Where a clinician wishes to use a treatment that has not received Nice approval, they can make an application to the health board under the all-Wales individual  patient funding request process. "These requests are con­sidered by an expert panel. Because each patient is different, each case has to be individu­ally assessed."	A former head of a Welsh health board has moved to England in order to get a cancer drug.
Two sections of the A3055 Undercliff Drive suffered landslips in February 2014, creating a three-mile detour between Niton and St Lawrence. Some residents, frustrated with delays, resurfaced the road themselves in October 2014, but the council shut it again for safety reasons. The authority says the new route will only be open for local access. The landslide, which happened during work to repair the road, caused eight homes to be evacuated. The council said the collapse was caused by unusually heavy rain in an area of "known land instability" where there had been numerous landslips in the past. The authority's planning committee has approved a new route, slightly inland, providing full access for local residents' vehicles, walkers, cyclists and horse riders, but closed to through traffic. The work will be carried out by the authority's contractor Island Roads under an existing Private Finance Initiative (PFI) deal. The company said the work would last eight weeks. Resident Tim Wright said the solution was a "temporary scheme" which failed to address drainage problems. The council said "retaining the existing drainage arrangements for the highway would not increase the potential for ground movement to occur". Planning chairman Bob Blezzard said he hoped in the future there would be another application for the road to be "fully reinstated".	A main road on the Isle of Wight is to be repaired more than two years after it collapsed due to heavy rain.
23 September 2014 Last updated at 17:05 BST It's part of her new role as a United Nations goodwill ambassador for women. The actress is hoping to challenge peoples views about women and the inequalities they suffer. Something inspired by her own experiences. Emma said: "I think it is right, that socially I am afforded the same respect as men, but sadly, I can say, that there is no one country in the world where all women can expect to receive these rights." She added: ''No country in the world can say they've achieved gender equality."	Harry Potter star Emma Watson's been speaking out about making boys and girls more equal.
The Iron have lost three of their last six league games, but are still second in League One. The home defeat by Shrewsbury on 11 February ended a run of 26 league games without losing at Glanford Park. "Let's get real, we are second in the league and that is after playing probably our worst football of the season," Swann told the club website. "Do you honestly believe that when a player doesn't control the ball with his first touch of the game we should be on his back?" He added: "The rumours of contract disputes, unrest in the team, a not-bothered attitude, is so far from the truth it hurts when I read it and certain people just want to derail our success whether knowingly, or not, which is even more annoying. "We ask passionately that you all get behind them and give them that chance to recapture their form and yes, do not panic, because we can do it, we can get promoted and we can be proud of them." The Iron were top of the table when they last won, against Port Vale on 28 January, but are now seven points behind leaders Sheffield United and level on points with third-placed Fleetwood. Scunthorpe host the Cod Army on Saturday.	Scunthorpe chairman Peter Swann has urged fans to keep faith in the team and "not get on players' backs".
The king commissioned the piano for the palace from renowned maker Thomas Tomkison in about 1821. The instrument displays the flamboyant taste Tomkison shared with the king. It was bought by Brighton and Hove City Council with funding from Arts Council England and the Victoria and Albert Museum, The piano is thought to have been removed from the Pavilion by Queen Victoria after she ascended the throne in 1837. However, its whereabouts for many years are unknown and it is thought to have held in private collections. A Brighton Pavilion spokeswoman described the instrument as "an elegant rosewood grand, extravagantly decorated, inlaid with brass, gilt mouldings and gilt turnbuckles, with elegantly carved legs". Councillor Alan Robins said: "King George's piano has long been on a wish list of desirable assets for the Royal Pavilion and so we're thrilled to have brought it back to its rightful home. "The piano is playable but as it's been dormant for 20 years will need some restoration. It would be amazing to be able to hear music of the period played on it."	King George IV's only known surviving grand piano has been returned to Brighton's Royal Pavilion after being bought at auction for Â£62,000.
Derek Serpell-Morris, known as DJ Derek, went missing last July aged 73. His remains were discovered in March after a high-profile search. During the service at St Agnes Church in St Pauls, Bristol, Gerald Serpell-Morris said his brother's "increasing fame amused him". In a eulogy he described his brother as "kind, modest and unassuming". Rev Liz Perry, the church's priest-in-charge, said: "Everyone described him with a great deal of love. "There was a great sense of humour about the place - a reflection of Derek and his personality. He was a showstopper and his funeral was a showstopper." Updates from the funeral on the BBC Local Live page DJ Derek, a former accountant, was known to thousands of music fans and played hundreds of sets at local clubs and pubs, as well as at the Glastonbury festival. He had lived in St Pauls in Bristol since 1978, worked with Massive Attack and once appeared in a Dizzee Rascal video. His great niece Jennifer Griffiths and friend Aiden Larkin - who was DJing at the church before the service - also gave eulogies. Bob Marley's One Love was played following the service which also included a bible reading about love from 1 Corinthians 13, an address by lay preacher Ian Love, and the hymn For the Beauty of the Earth.	Hundreds of people turned out to pay tribute to a man known as "Britain's oldest DJ" at his funeral in Bristol.
Augustin Dobre and Ionut Muti were caught on CCTV in a council probe into illegal dumping on Priory Road, Aston. They were recorded dumping items including building rubble, heating pipes and 15 rotting sheep carcasses. Dobre, 23, of Village Road in Aston, was handed a six-month prison sentence, while 24-year-old Muti, of Wood Lane in Handsworth, will serve 11 months. The pair were found to have dumped 42 tonnes of waste over 15 visits between August and October last year. Lisa Trickett, the city council's cabinet member for sustainability, said: "None of our neighbourhoods should have to suffer the misery associated with fly-tipping."	Two men who dumped sheep carcasses, mattresses and other rubbish on waste ground in Birmingham have been jailed.
In a 2005 letter, the prince referred to "the most pressing and urgent problem" of tuberculosis (TB) in cattle, which was "caused and spread" by badgers. He wrote: "I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary. The Labour government later rejected a cull in the English countryside. The revelations come from private letters sent by the Prince of Wales to Labour ministers a decade ago, which have been published after a lengthy legal battle. Prince Charles wrote: "I, for one, cannot understand how the 'badger lobby' seem to mind not at all about the slaughter of thousands of expensive cattle, and yet object to a managed cull of an over-population of badgers - to me, this is intellectually dishonest." In reply, Mr Blair said he could "personally see the case for culling badgers" but did not want to prejudge a decision by environment ministers". The coalition led by David Cameron gave the go-ahead for pilot culls in England in 2013. These are expected to resume for a third year in the Southwest this year and may be rolled out to other areas of England. Other letters written by the prince reveal more details of his interest in agriculture. He appealed for support for farmers and British-grown produce, and raised his "anxiety" about the country's lack of self-sufficiency in foods such as meat and vegetables. He also mentioned "the enormous problem of climate change", praising "the remarkable leadership role" the government was taking in this area.	Prince Charles asked the Blair government to consider the culling of badgers, historic documents reveal.
He had been facing charges of genocide during one of the most brutal periods in Guatemala's civil war. Doctors said he was not able to understand any charges against him. The medical report will affect two separate trials where he is charged with ordering the murder of hundreds of farmers and over 1,000 Mayan Indians. General  Rios Montt was found guilty of genocide and war crimes two years ago, and sentenced to 80 years in prison. The main charges were that he and his former intelligence chief ordered the army to carry out 15 massacres of Ixil Maya indigenous people in Quiche in northern Guatemala, in which around 1,700 Indians were killed. However, a high court then threw out the charges on procedural grounds and ordered a retrial. Another trial began in January but ended after the judge was rejected for having made public opinions about genocide in a student thesis. A new trial was set for July. This may now not take place because of the medical examiner's report declaring the ex-leader mentally incompetent.	A former Guatemalan general, Efrain Rios Montt, who ruled the country briefly in the 1980s, has been found mentally incapable of standing trial.
Wanda Campbell, 43, of Auchenmalg near Newton Stewart, was jailed for three years earlier this month. She was also ordered to pay compensation of £110,000 at Dumfries Sheriff Court. Her appeal against that sentence and the conviction will be heard at the Appeal Court in Edinburgh. She was found guilty after a seven-day trial of acting with others to take the money from James Haugh Castle Douglas between March 2012 and October 2013.	A woman found guilty of conning a south of Scotland garage firm out of £110,000 has lodged an appeal against her sentence and conviction.
The 21-year-old joined Tigers on loan in February, making five appearances, and is one of four uncapped players in the England squad for the summer Tests. Genge made his senior debut for Bristol in the 2013-14 British and Irish Cup, and scored six tries in 26 appearances. "Ellis has made a big impression in his time on loan with us," said Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill. "He is a great young prospect and he seems to have found his home at Leicester in his time on loan with us. "We hope he continues to build on that first impression and we look forward to seeing his development here." Genge is in the England squad both for Saturday's Test at home to Wales and the June tour of Australia.	Leicester Tigers have signed new England loose-head prop Ellis Genge from newly-promoted Bristol.
A court heard Aidan Chaves, 26, reacted angrily to taunts from fans and was spat on during a home game for Sawbridgeworth Town FC on 25 March. But he denied screaming threats at Clacton supporters on the touchline at the Hertfordshire club. Stevenage Magistrates Court adjourned the case for a later hearing to decide if he had made threatening comments. The three magistrates were told that Chaves faced derogatory remarks from the fans of the opposing team, including songs about his skill as a player, his tattoos and his mother. One fan is said to have spat on him as he prepared for a throw in. The court heard Chaves ran from to the changing room and emerged carrying a broken corkscrew. Prosecutor Prosecutor Rufia Khatun said that, holding it aloft and running towards the Clapton fans, he allegedly screamed "Come here. I'm going to cut your throat." Chaves - who gave his address as Mount Mellick Road, Portlaoise in the Irish Republic - pleaded guilty to a charge of having an offensive weapon in a public place. The court was told he entered the plea on the basis that he had not uttered the threats that had been referred to by the prosecution. In a statement he said he had grabbed the corkscrew to "ward the fans off". Magistrates adjourned the case so that another hearing can take place on 10 August to decide if he had made the threats as claimed by the prosecution. Chaves was granted unconditional bail.	A footballer accused of threatening fans with a corkscrew has admitted possession of an offensive weapon.
23 October 2015 Last updated at 18:33 BST But for Ivorian entrepreneurs, access to funds and training is sometimes complicated. Ahead of elections this coming Sunday, 24-year-old designer Anine Mariam Ouattara tells the BBC about difficulties young people face and her aspirations for her country.	Ivory Coast's economy is growing and the business environment has dramatically improved since the political crisis that hit the country following elections in 2010.
Cambridge University Press is analysing media coverage during Brazil 2014 and scoring 'confidence levels' out of 100. The score rises and falls dependent on the words used to describe England. Confidence was measured at 38 after the 2-2 draw with Ecuador on 4 June and 40 following the 0-0 draw with Honduras on 8 June but rose to 77 a day later. England's current rating is 70, going into the game in Manaus, according to the Cambridge Confidence Index. Researchers have analysed and assessed millions of words from a wide range of media sources over the past two weeks. Cambridge University Press's Dr Claire Dembry said: "The breadth of sources means we're able to give a unique insight into the mood surrounding the England team. "It's interesting to see that the nation is in confident spirits ahead of the Italy game, despite some fairly lacklustre performances against Ecuador and Honduras." Words such as "progress",  "strong" and "joy" have increasingly been used by players, coaching staff and fans. Midfielder Adam Lallana, 26, and 18-year-old Luke Shaw, who are both seeking to leave Southampton, have been described more positively than any other England player. Neymar, who scored twice in Brazil's 3-1 victory over Croatia, was the most talked about player after the opening match. "Controversial" was identified as the word of the day following the disputed penalty for Brazil's first goal and anti-World Cup protests in several host cities. Cambridge will track positive and negative indicators throughout the tournament, in order to measure changes in the perceived confidence in the England team.	Confidence in the England team is high ahead of Saturday's opening World Cup match against Italy, according to a study of words relating to football.
Officials at Grade II listed Guildford Cathedral said last year it was at risk because of deteriorating plasterwork, which contained asbestos. A £7m fundraising campaign was launched and now has only £500,000 left to meet the final target. Preparatory work will begin next month before building starts in October. The building, which is the last Church of England cathedral to be consecrated on a new site, is visible for miles from its Stag Hill location. Earlier this month, the cathedral was awarded a £4.6m grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. It has also raised funds from donations and a "buy a brick" campaign, which more than 200,000 people took part in. "Guildford Cathedral is a unique and vital community resource that brings people together," Mayor of Guildford David Elms, told a benefactor reception on Tuesday. "So many have already responded - because saving the cathedral matters." Repairs and improvements will include restoration of the cathedral's organ, better disabled access, new lighting and sound system and making its archive materials more easily available to the public.	A 1960s-built cathedral that was "at serious risk of closure" has raised more than 90% of its £7m target for urgent repairs and development.
The move comes a day after a federal appeals court in San Francisco lifted a ban that had been in place since 2008. Many Californian gay couples then rushed to get married. But the opponents say the appeals court acted prematurely because by law they had more time to appeal before the ban can be lifted. Friday's decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals court followed a ruling by the US Supreme Court against supporters of the California ban on gay marriage. On Saturday the Alliance Defending Freedom, which supports the ban, filed the petition asking the Supreme Court to overrule the order by appeals court. The group argued that by law it had 25 days to challenge the Supreme Court ruling, and therefore that the ban should not have been lifted. The Alliance Defending Freedom described the appeals court order as "the latest in a long line of judicial irregularities". The gay marriage ban - known as Proposition 8 - was approved by voters in 2008, months after California's supreme court decided such unions were legal. The two couples then launched the legal challenge. As the state of California refused to defend the proposition, the group that sponsored it stepped up to do so. But on Wednesday the Supreme Court ruled that a private party could not challenge the earlier lower court ruling, as it could not demonstrate it would suffer injury if same-sex marriages were allowed.	Opponents of same-sex marriage in California have filed an emergency petition to the US Supreme Court to try to halt gay weddings in the state.
He was held in Essex by officers working on the investigation into historical sex crimes. The probe was launched in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. The man has been released on bail until early December. The Met said the arrest fell under the strand of the operation known as "others". The investigation has also looked at the actions of Savile and allegations against "Savile and others". He is the 19th person arrested under the Yewtree probe.	A 79-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of sexual offences by Operation Yewtree detectives, Scotland Yard has said.
The Ibrox club had two bids rejected by the Canaries for the 30-year-old Scot, who becomes Pedro Caixinha's ninth summer signing. Dorrans told Rangers TV: "It feels incredible. It has been a long couple of weeks, but to finally get it over the line is an incredible feeling. "I just can't wait to get the boots on and get started." Bruno Alves, Daniel Candeias, Carlos Pena, Eduardo Herrera, Dalcio, Ryan Jack, Alfredo Morelos and Fabio Cardoso have all made the move to Ibrox. Dorrans made his senior debut for Livingston in a Scottish Premier League game against Kilmarnock in May 2005 and went on to make 91 appearances for the West Lothian club before joining West Bromwich Albion in July 2008. He had seven seasons at the Hawthorns, spending his last four months on loan at Norwich, who he signed for in the summer of 2015. He made 25 appearances in his first season and a further 24 last term. After signing a three-year deal with the Ibrox club, Dorrans added: "I don't think there is ever a wrong time to come to a football club like this. "The size of this football club is incredible - I've obviously had great times down in England, especially at West Brom, but growing up, I knew I always wanted to come to this football club and when the chance came around I jumped at it."

In England, only schools with academy status are allowed to form trusts to sponsor weaker schools. And, the Local Government Association said, a shortage of "good quality" sponsors often left failing schools "in the dark about their future". Ministers said there was no legal frame for council schools to be sponsors. The Local Government Association says 91% of council maintained schools are rated  good or outstanding by education watchdog Ofsted - so they should be allowed "to play a direct role in raising education standards and improving life chances, including taking on the running of failing academies". New analysis of Ofsted ratings for the LGA by education analysts Angel Solutions found a higher percentage of good and outstanding grades among council maintained schools than among academies. Of 14,890 council maintained schools inspected, 91% are rated good or outstanding by Ofsted, compared with 85% of 5,058 academies, say the researchers. There are wide variations within the academy category, with sponsored academies, which are forced into academy status after poor Ofsted ratings, predictably faring worse than converter academies, which must be rated good or outstanding before being allowed to convert. The LGA points out that the majority of academies are converter academies. Inspection ratings for 4,103 converter academies showed 89% rated good or outstanding but among the 955 sponsored academies inspected the figure was only 65%, according to the analysis. Richard Watts, chairman of the LGA's Children and Young People Board, said the figures proved councils had "the track record, experience and expertise to help lift schools out of academic failure". "The government must commit to removing the unnecessary red tape and give high performing maintained schools the option of becoming academy sponsors. "Councils want to be regarded as improvement partners, not obstructionists to school improvement," said Mr Watts, who is also the leader of Islington Council. "With a shortage of academy sponsors and struggling schools currently in the dark about their future the simplest remedy is to give councils the power to turn these schools around where this is the best option locally." Mr Watts also voiced concerns about the local knowledge and capacity of the eight Regional Schools Commissioners, whose job is to oversee academic standards. He said that without the help of councils "the early warning signs of failing" risked being overlooked. "It is not acceptable that we have to wait for poor exam results, whistle-blowing about financial impropriety or an Ofsted inspection to trigger intervention. "Councils are best placed to oversee school effectiveness and take immediate action where required," added Mr Watts. A Department for Education spokesman said there was no legal framework for a council or council-run school to sponsor a school unless they opened a trust - and this would involve converting to academy status. "We would encourage good or outstanding council-run schools to apply to become a sponsor so they can share their expertise," said the spokesman. The spokesman said councils could not run multi-academy trusts "as legally less than 20% of members and trustees are allowed to be 'local authority influenced' to ensure the trust remains autonomous from the local authority".	A ban on top council-run schools sponsoring failing schools amounts to "red tape" and should be dropped, say council bosses.
A bill is being considered to bolster animal protection by barring any use of wild animals in travelling shows. Martin Burton of the Association of Circus Proprietors told MSPs that a law based on the proposed ethical grounds "will eventually close your zoos". A government consultation found widespread support for a formal ban. The Wild Animals in Travelling Circuses (Scotland) Bill would be the first of its kind in the UK, and is aimed at banning the use of non-domesticated animals for either performance or exhibition. Holyrood's environment committee took evidence from a range of animal welfare and circus industry groups. Mr Burton told members that there were no circuses with wild animals which have visited Scotland in recent times. However, he said a lack of clarity in the legislation about what constitutes a travelling circus and the definition of a wild animal, along with the emphasis on ethics, could have far-reaching consequences. He said: "The economic impact on animal displays in shopping centres, on displays at outdoors shows of hawks and wild birds, on reindeer and Santa, and eventually zoos will be massive. "Eventually that is where this will all go, this will eventually close your zoos." He added: "Once you start banning things, particularly on ethical grounds, it is clear that this will spread, because if it's ethically not right to have a wild animal in a circus, then it is ethically not right to have a wild animal appear at a gala or a county show, and it is ethically not right to have a wild animal appear in a shopping centre, and it is ethically not right to have a wild animal appear in a zoo. "It is clear and logical that that is the only way an ethical ban can go. You can't choose your ethics, you're either going to say it is ethical or it is not ethical." Meanwhile, Rona Brown from the Circus Guild of Great Britain said there was no scientific evidence of current welfare issues for wild animals in circuses, with government vets inspecting licensed circuses three times a year. However, members also heard from Dr Dorothy McKeegan, from the Institute of Biodiversity Animal Health and Comparative Medicine at the University of Glasgow, who said the arguments in the bill were valid. She said the use of wild animals in the circus was disrespectful, and that there was a welfare argument as well as an ethical one to be made. Members also heard from representatives of City of Edinburgh and Argyll and Bute councils, who said they did not allow circuses to use their land if they had wild animals. A government consultation in 2014 showed 98% of respondents thought the use of wild animals for performance in travelling circuses should be banned and 96.4% thought the use of wild animals for exhibition (without performing) should be banned. Animal protection organisations such as the Born Free Foundation, Captive Animals' Protection Society and OneKind have also welcomed the move.	A ban on using wild animals in travelling circuses could eventually lead to zoos in Scotland being closed down, a circus leader has told MSPs.
Mr Blunkett said using the same funding formula applied to Wales - which has a devolved budget - Yorkshire would be entitled to a Â£24bn budget. "You put great store by devolving decision-making to ordinary people," he told Prime Minister David Cameron. Mr Cameron said the government had already got rid of a "centralised" approach that Mr Blunkett was part of. Mr Blunkett, a Labour former Cabinet minister and the MP for Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough, made the suggestion during prime minister's questions in the House of Commons. He said: "Can you think of one single reason why the people of Yorkshire shouldn't determine their own priorities? "And, mischievously, one reason why the people of Yorkshire shouldn't have their own White Rose Parliament?" Mr Cameron said: "What we are doing is we are saying to councils in Yorkshire, as up and down the country, 'We are getting rid of the ring fences, we are giving you the power to spend your money in the way that you choose'." He added: "We have got rid of the bossy, centralised interfering approach that I'm afraid you were rather part of."	Yorkshire should be given its own "White Rose Parliament" with its own budget, MP David Blunkett has said.
The evacuation of the Jet2 plane at East Midlands Airport was hampered when one of the escape chutes did not work. It came after the pilot was unable to check whether landing gear had deployed and the failure of the cabin PA system. The initial fault was caused by a loose connection the Air Accident Investigation Branch concluded. Because of the landing gear problems, the pilot - flying from Ibiza last September - was forced to fly over the airport at 1,000 ft (300m) so ground crew could check if it had come down, the report said. But it was too dark to tell and the co-pilot had to look out of windows in the main cabin, before the pilot was cleared to land. As the plane taxied on the runway, passengers reportedly panicked when the smoke began to seep into the cabin. Because the PA system was not working, cabin crew tried to use a loud hailer to tell passengers but the volume button had fallen off. The escape chute then failed to deploy effectively, forcing some of the passengers to run out on to the wing before leaping onto the ground. One member of cabin crew only realised the plane was being evacuated when she saw passengers on the wing. According to the report, a problem was first spotted when the pilots realised the address system was not working. Several other failures were noticed including an equipment cooling fan, a radio, weather radar, the autobrake, power to the standby altitude indicator and compass. It was realised there was a problem with a battery connection, known as a busbar, forcing the pilots to request a quick landing at the airport. After a successful landing, passengers and crew could smell smoke but the commander could not announce a full evacuation. Since the incident, Jet2 has included a procedure within its manual which will better-prepare pilots in the event of a repeat and also reduce the chance it will result in an evacuation, the report said. The AAIB concluded all the problems - bar the escape chute - stemmed from the loose connection possibly caused by the over-tightened nut. It also noted smoke started to seep into the cabin because a fan stopped working creating a build up of dust and oil in the air conditioning. It was suggested the problem with the escape chute could be because a crew member was more used to opening a door on the opposite side of the plane.	Passengers escaped a smoke-filled plane by jumping from the wing after a series of problems caused by an electrical fault, investigators say.
The move comes after faulty Poly Implant ProthÃ¨se (PIP) silicone breast implants were recalled in 2010, affecting thousands of women. The inclusion of individual patients' details will not be mandatory. However, all providers of breast implant surgery will be expected to participate in the scheme. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "We want the NHS to be the safest healthcare system in the world and anyone who chooses to have a cosmetic procedure has the right to safe care. "The PIP breast implant scandal in 2010 affected thousands of people which is why we asked NHS Digital to develop a new register which will allow people to be traced swiftly if that is ever needed." As a result of poor record-keeping following the PIP scandal, many women were unable to find out if they had been given the faulty implants. In some cases, because surgery providers had gone out of business, women who received the implants could not be traced. The Breast and Cosmetic Implant Registry - which will be managed by NHS Digital - will include patients treated by both NHS and private providers. And participation in the registry will be noted during Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspections. The registry will be expanded in the future to also cover other cosmetic implants, such as buttock or calf implants. It is expected to record more than 20,000 cases of implant surgery every year and allow complications with specific implants to be picked up. Providers will be expected to submit data on patients via an online portal. Explicit consent from patients will be required to add their details to the registry - and this is in addition to the usual consent for the surgical procedure. Noel Gordon, chair of NHS Digital, said the registry marked a major step forward in improving patient safety for people who undergo breast implant surgery each year. "We look forward to working with patients and providers to ensure that the benefits of this important registry are delivered." The British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons, the Association of Breast Surgery and the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons welcomed the registry. In a joint statement, they said: "This will protect patients by providing a way to actively monitor all implants, track and trace their use and provide data for further research, which may be used to further technological advances. "We hope that all patients will consent to the submission of data on their behalf."	A register of patients in England with breast and other cosmetic implants has been set up to allow them to be traced in the event of any safety concerns.
The 34-year-old England international, who scored 15 league goals last season, has signed a three-year deal. "It's great to be back," said Defoe, who as a teenager spent the 2000-01 season on loan at Bournemouth from West Ham, scoring in 10 successive matches. "It was an easy decision, joining a top team with a top manager. The one thing I can guarantee is goals." The former Tottenham, Portsmouth, West Ham and Charlton player is seventh on the Premier League all-time goals list with 158 in 468 appearances. Cherries manager Eddie Howe said Defoe's signing is a "huge moment for the club". Defoe moved to Sunderland in January 2015 after a brief spell at MLS side Toronto and, after saving the club from relegation in the 2015-16 season with 15 goals, signed a contract extension until 2019. There was a clause in his contract that allowed him to leave on a free transfer if Sunderland were relegated, which he was able to trigger when the Black Cats finished bottom last season. Defoe made his England debut in 2004 and played at the 2010 World Cup, but did not feature for the national side between 2013 and 2017. His excellent form last season earned him a recall to Gareth Southgate's side, and he scored his 20th international goal against Lithuania in a World Cup qualifier in March. Defoe is Bournemouth's second signing of the summer, following the arrival of goalkeeper Asmir Begovic from Chelsea. "We want to bring players here who can have a big impact on our continued rise and we believe Jermain fits that as a natural, proven goalscorer," added Howe. The Cherries finished ninth in the Premier League last term - their second season in the top flight. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.

Estimated figures from its Federal Statistical Office said gross domestic product was 1.9% higher last year than in 2015. The annual figure is based on an early estimated that growth was around 0.5% in the fourth quarter. However, the actual fourth quarter figure will not be released until early next month. The 1.9% figure for 2016 was slightly above expectations, and builds on the growth rate of 1.6% in 2014 and 1.7% for 2015. Germany's exports were up by 2.4%, but that was outstripped by import growth of 3.4%. Household spending grew by 2%, while government spending was up by 4.2%, partly because of an increase in spending on assisting the vast numbers of asylum seekers the country has taken on. The country has enjoyed seven years of economic growth. Unusually for a developed country, it has a budget surplus. Last year's totalled 0.6% of gross domestic product, down a touch on 2015's 0.7%.	Germany's economy stepped up its pace of growth in 2016, thanks to higher household and government spending.
The 56-year-old ex-Derbyshire skipper leaves his post as club president to take the newly created job. Graeme Welch left as elite performance director in June, having been appointed following a management revamp in 2014. "We have not achieved enough success in recent years. We're determined to change this," said Barnett. "With a strong captain and players technically sound and tactically clued up, we will be in a great position for next season." Derbyshire finished bottom of Division Two, having failed to win a County Championship match in 2016. A review of the "cricket pathway to the first XI" was undertaken, with a new coaching structure put in place alongside a "targeted" recruitment drive for experience senior players, which will be funded by savings made by revamping the coaching team. Barnett will head a smaller backroom staff "streamlined" and aided by player-coaches, who will work "occasionally" with specialised "world class" coaches and cricketers. The new structure sees the post of first XI support coach and Twenty20 specialist coach created - neither of which have been filled yet. "The Elite Performance model regrettably has not produced the results that we have been hoping for," Derbyshire chairman Chris Grant told the club website. "We have been spending over 20% of our overall cricket budget on coaching and this new model will achieve a better balance between our coaching and playing budget."	Former England batsman Kim Barnett has been named Derbyshire director of cricket in the latest coaching restructure at the Division Two club.
The Age UK review said some people could not even wash, dress or feed themselves and yet were being left to fend for themselves by councils. And the charity warned that the whole system was close to collapse in some areas with services closing. It comes after the government said it was looking to solve the problems. Last week, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt pledged action on social care, which covers care homes and help in the home. That has prompted a growing expectation that a rescue package will be announced in the Budget in early March. Care is funded by either councils or individuals themselves - although growing numbers are also relying on family and friends to support them. The Age UK review looked at existing data and concluded there were nearly 1.2 million people who were not now getting the care they need - a rise of 48% since 2010. This included: The charity said this had been caused by cuts to council budgets which had led to a rationing of services. Last year, fewer than half of the people who requested help from councils were given it. You stay in your own home while getting help with everyday tasks such as washing, dressing and eating. average amount of care provided per week, by your council average paid per hour by your council, 2014-15 average paid per hour in your region if you pay for your own care, 2016 You live in a care home that provides round-the-clock support with everyday tasks. TBC pay for their own care You live in a care home which provides round-the-clock support for everyday tasks and nursing care. Depending on your medical needs, the NHS may contribute to your costs. TBC pay for their own care Savings, investments and income are assessed, along with the value of your home - unless you or a close relative live there. As well as reducing the numbers of people they help, councils have also started to squeeze the fees they pay agencies that run care homes and home help services. A report by market analysts Laing Buission earlier this year that estimated councils were paying £100 less a week than the going rate for a care home place. The Age UK review said half of councils had seen a care home provider cease trading in their area, while a third had seen a home care agency fold. Age UK director Caroline Abrahams said: "Our new report makes for frightening reading because it shows just how fragile older people's social care now is. "We think there is a real risk of collapse in social care in the worst affected areas." Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association, which represents councils, said the review was "deeply disturbing". "Genuine new government money is now the only way to protect the services." Councils spent £16bn last year on services for elderly and disabled people. It comes after funding from central government was cut by a third in real terms during the last Parliament. Councils protected social care by making big cuts elsewhere but still had to reduce the amount they spent on social care by 6%. Ministers have given councils the ability to ring-fence council tax increases for care services in the coming years and have used NHS money to invest in services, but the LGA predicts by 2020 there will still be a £2.6bn shortfall. In an interview with the BBC last week, Mr Hunt pledged the government would address the pressures in the social care system. A Department of Health spokeswoman said it was not all about money, but added ministers were "working to find a long-term, sustainable solution".

Writing on Facebook, Vine said he too had been attacked as a 15-year-old. He encouraged the boy not to try to be tough like his attackers, saying there was "no shame" in reading poetry and listening to "our favourite bands". "Dear Romford 15-year-old, who I'll call Ben. I don't know your name, and it's good that I don't, because I am sure you do not want to be associated with that video of the bullies savagely punching you to the ground. Bullies? They are worse than that. I was really shocked by what I saw. Loads of people were disgusted. You are just 15. Ben, something similar happened to me. I was a sensitive young teen, always trying and failing to be coolâ€¦ never athletic enough, never hip enough, a late developer, crazy hair, with uncool parents who thought church was the main event. I worshipped indie bands - Joy Division especially - in the way that sensitive souls do. I wanted to be a jock, but I was a nerd. Maybe you recognise that. One day I was at a party and spoke to a girl. Apparently she was the girlfriend of someone important. He sent his friend to beat me up. The friend said: "Excuse me, can I tell you something?" And because he was shorter than me I had to lean down to hear him. Having moved my head within range, he punched me as hard as you got punched. I had never been hit before. The shock was unbelievable - violence does that. I went down immediately just like you. My mates, also sensitive souls, were too scared to help. They were gutted afterwards. You feel humiliated. Your pride is hurt, your head is hurt - I had a gigantic black eye. A person can get very down over a beating. Some people think depression evolved in us as a way of keeping us safe if we lose a fight - the mind and body working together to prevent you re-entering the conflict for your own safety. It took me ages before I wasn't scared of being hit again. You look over your shoulder for a while, and you feel a primal fear. That is natural, Ben. So I watched your video and saw myself. That guy who distracted me in 1980 could be the thug who hit you from behind in 2016 - such a coward. Can I give you some advice? Don't think you have to be hard like them. I tried to be a tough teenager afterwards and closed myself off like a drum. I reacted to nothing and felt nothing. Then I got to university and found people like me who would never dream of punching someone, and my life opened up like a flower. A kind lecturer was shocked when I proudly and foolishly told him I had never read a poem. He said, "We'll change that," and helped me understand the power of poetry. One day in my student room I read a poem and cried. I was alive again. Sure, I would never win a fight - I have never hit anyone in my life - but you don't need to hit people to succeed in your life. Quite the opposite. The courts will decide who assaulted you and how to punish them. In our society, what happened to you is thankfully now taken very seriously. But let me tell you something about the lads in the video. In 20 years, when you're with the person you love and hopefully in a career you have a passion for, they will still be scumbags. Their cupboards will smell of gym sweat and cheeseburgers. Each will own one suit which he wore to the funeral of a friend who died doing a wheelie on a motorway - by the way, they all wore the same baffled expression at the funeral service. They've gone from making the weather to being rained on, and they complain about it constantly. They are not something anyone wants to be with - their lives are already over. Five per cent of people are good at fighting. I'm not one and nor are you. It is very important we let the 5% fight each other. Live by the sword, die by the sword: the thug who beat me up was in hospital himself a year later after someone broke a bottle across his face. Meanwhile, you and I can read poetry and listen to our favourite bands, and if we sometimes cry, there is no shame in that. To cry is to live. The people who attacked you are the walking dead. Come into Radio 2 sometime and I'd be happy to show you around. Yours, Jeremy"	BBC Radio 2 and Crimewatch presenter Jeremy Vine has written a letter to a 15-year-old after a video shared on social media showed the boy being attacked by a group of teenagers in Romford, east London.
She made the announcement at the Dorset Rape Crisis charity screening of the show's final episode in Bridport, Dorset, on Monday evening. Hesmondhalgh said she was proud to have "given a voice" to rape victims in the eight-part crime serial. The charity said it was "excited" she had agreed to take the position. The storyline of the third and final series of Broadchurch, which is part-filmed in West Bay, centred on the rape of Trish Winterman - played by former Coronation Street actress Hesmondhalgh. Among the relationships that develop in the show is Trish's work with her rape counsellor Beth Lattimer, portrayed by Jodie Whittaker. Tracy Parsons, from Dorset Rape Crisis, which worked closely with Broadchurch's writer and producer, Chris Chibnall, said the programmes had shown there was support for people struggling with the legacy of rape. "We are really excited that Julie has agreed to be our patron - it's huge for our trustees, staff and clients that someone who is so well known is coming onboard," she said. Hesmondhalgh said: "I was very relieved that I had given a voice - in my own small way in this big project - to the people who have been through [rape]." Of her new role as patron of Dorset Rape Crisis, she said: "I feel very proud to be part of increasing the profile of anybody who is doing this incredible, important, essential work." She described rape as a "pressing" issue, adding: "We need to start having conversations at home with our families - with our daughters and our sons - about consent and about respect, and about healthy, sexual relationships."	Broadchurch actress Julie Hesmondhalgh has become the patron of a rape crisis charity following her depiction of a rape victim in the ITV drama.
"Another terrorist attack in Paris," Mr Trump wrote. "The people of France will not take much more of this. Will have a big effect on presidential election!" The previous day, during a joint press conference with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, Mr Trump had quickly labelled the incident a "terrorist attack" - before even French authorities had done so. "It's a very, very terrible thing that is going on in the world today," Mr Trump said. "And what can you say? It just never ends. We have to be strong and we have to be vigilant, and I've been saying it for a long time." That last line is certainly true. While the dynamics of French politics are decidedly different from those in the US, Mr Trump may recall that another incident in Paris - the November 2015 mass shooting at the Bataclan theatre - helped solidify his lead in the polls leading into the Republican presidential primaries. "Everyone is now saying how right I was with illegal immigration and the wall," he tweeted several days after the attack two years ago. "After Paris, they're all on the bandwagon." Mr Trump did not mention her by name, but the president seems to be predicting the Champs-Elysees shooting will be a boost for French nationalist candidate Marine Le Pen, who has campaigned on deporting suspected Islamic militants and a French withdrawal from the European Union. Although Mr Trump has not formally met the French presidential candidate, she is close to some of the same advisers who helped craft the president's populist message during his campaign last year and was spotted in Trump Tower during the presidential transition in January. Breitbart News, which was an early supporter of Mr Trump's improbable presidential bid, has also warmly covered Ms Le Pen's efforts. "A new world is emerging, global equilibriums are being redefined by the fact of Trump's election," Ms Le Pen said the day after Mr Trump's presidential victory. "Their world is crumbling; ours is being built." While critics may view Mr Trump's Friday morning tweet as an unwelcome effort to influence the politics of another nation, the reality is slightly more complicated than that. Earlier on Thursday former President Barack Obama spoke with another leading French candidate, Emmanuel Macron, who has campaigned in favour of a strong European Union and open borders. "The main message I have is to wish you all the best in the coming days." Mr Obama said in an edited video of the call that Mr Macron posted on Twitter. "And make sure, as you said, that you work very hard all the way through because you never know, it might be that last day of campaigning that makes all the difference." "Let's keep defending our progressive values," Mr Macron wrote. "Thank you for this discussion @BarackObama". In other words, the French election - from an American perspective, at least - could be setting up a proxy battle between the current and former president and their competing views of economic nationalism versus liberal globalism. A similar dynamic played out during last June's Brexit referendum in the UK, when Mr Obama tacitly endorsed the Remain camp, while Mr Trump heralded the Leave victory as evidence that his nationalist politics were gathering strength. Now, after two notable defeats for the existing international establishment - in Brexit and Mr Trump's November election - Mr Obama may view Mr Macron as a last, best hope to stem a rising populist tide in the West. Although European Union supporters were heartened by the results in the recent Dutch elections, where nationalist candidate Geert Wilders was defeated, the French vote is a much more significant matter. Mr Trump and his advisers may view Ms Le Pen as the hand that will deliver a death blow to the European Union and cement his own election as more than a quirk of American politics and, instead, as the harbinger of a new global order.

The memory of the "Boy from Bassendean" - a suburb in the Western Australian state capital - is being erased by the local council. He has gone from favourite son to outcast by a simple show of hands at a council meeting. Harris's artworks will be taken down from its chambers and his status as a freeman has been rescinded, while a plaque outside his childhood home was stolen before the local authority could remove it. "We simply cannot tolerate the horrendous crimes for which he's been convicted," Bassendean Mayor John Gangell told ABC radio. And the backlash is spreading. In Melbourne a public mural, the "Entertainers of the Century" that features 100 prominent performers, will be changed to paint over Rolf Harris's cheery image. There is speculation, too, that Harris could be stripped of his Order of Australia award, one of the nation's most coveted honours. His conviction comes at a sensitive time for Australia, where the depravity of paedophiles is being scrutinised like never before. A royal commission into institutional responses to child sex abuse continues to uncover a terrible flood of atrocities, and could take years to complete its task. Justice Peter McClellan, who chairs it, believes that victims who have suffered alone for so long are finally coming forward because of high-profile court cases, including the conviction of Harris. "It is becoming apparent as we do our work that as the issue of abuse is raised and talked about, survivors increasingly feel able to bring their own story to the authorities," said Justice McClellan. "That which may have been kept secret for years may now be told. The burden of guilt and shame which many have felt is lifted by knowing that others who have suffered have overcome their reticence," he added. The law firm Slater & Gordon says since Harris's trial began it has been contacted by around a dozen women in Australia and New Zealand alleging they were molested by the TV presenter. "My understanding is that we're talking about assaults that occurred in those countries going back to the 70s and 80s," said lawyer Alan Collins. "Given what we heard in [Southwark Crown] court, a number of victims have suffered a very profound damage, I would have thought it highly likely that claims would be brought." Hetty Johnston, founder of one of Australia's most prominent child safety groups, Bravehearts Inc, raised the prospect of further charges against Harris. "Rolf Harris - icon to inmate. Victims vindicated. Hopefully when he comes out there will be more victims waiting to send him right back," Ms Johnston tweeted. Convicted by a court half a world away, 84-year old Harris has felt the full force of media outrage back home. The Australian has detailed "his most spectacular fall from cuddly establishment showman to jailbird," while the Sydney Morning Herald said he was "always an embarrassing curiosity rather than a national treasure". Harris was, the paper told its readers, a "mild colonial boy who simply went bad".	Australia is racing to distance itself from Rolf Harris as the shamed Perth-born entertainer starts a jail term for abusing young girls.
The forward, who turns 37 next week, has played over 500 games since joining his hometown club as a teenager. "It's what I and the club wanted. I thank them for giving me another chance to wear the shirt of the only team I've ever supported and loved," he said. Francesco Totti is 47 goals away from becoming Serie A's all-time leading goalscorer. Ex-Lazio, Torino and Juventus striker Silvio Piola, who played between 1929 and 1954, leads the way with 274 strikes. The ex-Italy international made his Serie A debut aged 16 in March 1993. Totti has scored 228 goals for Roma, putting him second on the all-time list of leading Serie A goalscorers. He played a key role in Roma's 2000-01 title win and also helped them to six runners-up spots between 2002 and 2010. And the five-time Italian Footballer of the Year, whose new deal runs until the end of the 2015-16 season, has started all three matches of Roma's 100% winning start to the Serie A season under new manager Rudi Garcia. "I have another two years of responsibility and I know that we can do great things here," he said ahead of Sunday's Rome derby against Lazio. "So far this season we've got off on the right foot, we have a manager who wants his team to play and demands respect, which we haven't had recently." Totti won 58 international caps for Italy, retiring shortly after helping them win the 2006 World Cup.	Roma captain Francesco Totti has signed a new two-year contract which ties him to the Italian side until just before his 40th birthday.
Overweight children between four and 18 months old eat similar food to healthy weight children but have bigger portions, a study found. The University College, London report said parents may not realise how much young children should be eating or the dangers of them being overweight. It said feeding guidelines needed to be more specific and better known. The study of data from a UK survey, being presented at the European Obesity Summit in Gothenburg, Sweden, looked at eating diaries parents kept for 2,564 children. The diaries showed what children ate, how often they were eating and the size of their portions. Researchers used the data to compare the eating habits of overweight children - classed as being in the heaviest 15% in their age group - and those of a healthy weight. The report found overweight children were consuming larger meals than their counterparts (141 calories versus 130 calories). Report author Hayley Syrad, from University College, London, said: "The research suggests eating frequency is having no impact on weight and it's not that parents of larger children are giving them an extra Mars bar or apple - it's that their portions are bigger." For every extra 24 calories consumed during each meal, there was a 9% increased risk of becoming overweight or obese, researchers said. Ms Syrad said the research suggested some parents may be overfeeding their infants, potentially under the belief it is healthy for babies to be "chubby". She added: "We know that even birth weight tracks into later life. If children are overweight when they are under two it tracks into adulthood. "A bigger baby is likely to be a bigger child and then a bigger adult." According to Public Health England, which publishes its advice on the NHS Choices website, there is "very little official guidance on precisely how much food children require". But it says: "A good rule of thumb is to start meals with small servings and let your child ask for more if they are still hungry. "Try not to make your child finish everything on the plate or eat more than they want to. And avoid using adult-size plates for younger children as it encourages them to eat oversized portions." The guidance also says children should be encouraged to eat slowly and have set mealtimes. Judy More, a nutritionist and paediatric dietician, said some parents were overfeeding their babies and young children out of fear of them being underfed. She said babies and young children who are not overweight should eat until they are full rather than being made to finish everything on their plate. "It's the parents' responsibility to provide nutritious food, but they should allow children to eat as much they want to." Ms Syrad added that eating guidelines for infants and toddlers needed to be more specifically catered to smaller age ranges. She said it was important for future research to follow the children in the study and see how food intake affects their weight as they get older. Anne-Marie O'Leary, editor-in-chief of parenting website Netmums, said more guidance and support for parents was needed. "Dietary advice for adults is conflicted and confusing - the U-turn on fats, sugar becoming the bad guy - let alone for parents. "When parents are weaning their babies, most of the advice is about making sure they are gaining enough weight, not about making sure they don't gain too much." She said the website was one of the bodies consulted by the government in advance of upcoming Department of Health guidelines on childhood obesity. And one of Netmums' posts illustrating portion size for toddlers was one of its stories that generated most reader engagement.	Parents may be feeding their babies and toddlers larger portions than they need, experts have warned.
Unconfirmed media reports say that Chinese troops have entered what India says is its territory near the disputed border. "Chumar sector in eastern Ladakh remained active with Chinese Peoples' Liberation Army (PLA) troops involved in tactical manoeuvre with the Indian army to exercise dominance by transgressing the Line of Actual Control (the de facto border)," reports the Hindustan Times. Papers also report that the army chief, General Dalbir Singh Suhag, has cancelled his Bhutan visit due to the tensions on the border. "The decision to put off the trip has been taken at a time when, for the last more than 10 days, Chinese troops have been sitting on this side of the Indian boundary in Chumar area of Ladakh," says a report on the First Post website. Some media outlets say the tensions are likely to "undo" the progress made during Chinese President Xi Jinping's India visit last week. Mr Xi and PM Narendra Modi had shown a keen interest in improving bilateral ties. "The great bonhomie generated between Asia's giants at Ahmedabad and New Delhi is withering away in the windswept cold desert of Ladakh," says the India Today website. Moving on to other stories, Abhinav Bindra, one of India's top Indian shooters, on Tuesday won two bronze medals in the ongoing Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea, The Times of India reports. His good performance comes a day after he announced his retirement from the sport. Bindra on Monday tweeted that the ongoing Asian Games could be his last competitive event. "Tomorrow will mark the end of my professional shooting life! I will however still shoot, compete as a hobby shooter training twice a week," he tweeted. And finally, papers are praising India's space agency after the country's maiden mission to Mars "entered the Martian neighbourhood" on Monday. Launched last November, the spacecraft - known as Mangalyaan - will complete a 300-day journey to reach the orbit on Wednesday. "If successful, India will become the first country to make it to Mars in its maiden attempt, propelling it to an elite club of space race leaders," the Hindustan Times reports.

Crews were called to the blaze at a building in Stewartville Street, in Partick, at about 12:15. The fire broke out in a communal area of the block. Four people were treated at the scene for the effects of smoke inhalation. The blaze triggered a large response from the emergency services. A spokesman for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said: "On arrival crews found a well-developed fire on the third floor of a six-storey residential block of flats with residents unable to leave the building. "Firefighters quickly brought the fire under control, whilst at the same time rescuing 17 people from the property, some of whom were suffering from slight smoke inhalation and minor injuries." Crews worked through the night to deal with any fire spread and make the scene safe. A spokeswoman for Police Scotland said: "About 25 to 30 persons were evacuated." The Scottish Ambulance Service sent four resources from their special operations response team, two A&E ambulances and an ambulance car. A spokesman said: "We did not transport anyone to hospital. We dealt with smoke inhalation."	Firefighters have rescued 17 people from a six-storey block of flats in Glasgow's west end after a serious fire left them trapped in the building.
Police were called to the Bristol Road South branch, in Northfield, at 11:45 GMT to reports a female member of staff was being held hostage in an interview room. West Midlands Police said it is understood a firearm was produced, but no threats or demands were made. They said the man, aged 60, surrendered to police at about 12:50 GMT. Police said the suspect, who is believed to be from the local area and a customer at the branch, was taken to hospital for an assessment. He is expected to be questioned later on suspicion of firearms offences.

Samantha Lacey, 32, from Northfield, said she arrived at the bank to make a deposit but found the door was shut. She said: "There were about six people outside. When I asked what happened they said a man walked in, pulled a gun out and told all customers to get out." Ch Insp Shaun Phillips said: "Officers quickly surrounded the bank, set-up a street cordon and established phone contact with some staff members who were hiding in a back room. "It's understood the man was with one female staff member, while other staff were lying low in another back room. "No customers were caught up in the incident and no-one was hurt."	A man was arrested on suspicion of holding a staff member at gunpoint at a NatWest bank in Birmingham.
The firm issued a profit warning on Tuesday, saying it expects $1.2bn in asset impairment charges as coal prices remain at "lower levels for an extended period of time". It also expects to book a loss from the sale of its agricultural unit. Noble reports its annual results on Thursday. "Long-end crude prices have fallen by almost 40% over a very short period of time," Noble, Asia's biggest commodities trader by volume, said in a statement. "Crude, besides being the benchmark for the energy sector, is also a key driver of the cost curves for coal miners via their consumption of fuel. In addition, the Paris COP21 agreement raises the probability of future substitution away from coal." "The combination of these factors, combined with a growing concern about weaker economic growth globally and especially in China has had a knock on effect on consensus estimates of future coal prices". Noble, which buys and sells long-term contracts for raw materials like coal, iron ore and oil, relies on its energy division for most of the company's revenue. But like industry rivals Glencore and Olam International, its been hard hit by the fall in commodity prices which has also eroded the value of their assets like storage facilities. Coal prices are at near nine-year lows because of slowing demand from China and the global move towards cleaner sources of fuel. Noble now estimates thermal coal contracts for 2020 and beyond to trade at $55 per tonne, which is below market consensus. Last year, the company's debt rating was cut to junk by ratings agencies Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's over concerns about its finances. The Singapore-listed company has been trying to reassure investors since it was accused of misleading accounting and targeted by short sellers. Noble's share price has lost 70% of its value since research firm Iceberg Research, which focuses heavily on Noble, alleged last year that it was inflating its assets. Other companies, including GMT Research, have since come forward to criticise the trader's accounting practices. Noble has rejected the allegations and denied any wrongdoing. An audit by consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers also found it had complied with international accounting rules. Market sentiment Noble said its cash balance was a record $1.95bn at the end of December. It also expects $1bn more in liquidity by March. The Hong Kong-based company has more than $2bn worth of debt payments to make this year, but investors have questioned its ability to refinance debt. Markets have been mostly negative on Noble's performance so far, with its stocks and bonds trading at depressed levels. Noble shares were the worst performer on Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Index last year. The cost of protecting the company's notes against non-payment for one year is also the highest in Asia, according to Bloomberg News and data provider CMA. "The most interesting aspect of today's statement was that the company is likely cash flow generative in the fourth quarter," Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, director of research at Religare Capital Markets told the BBC. "Investors are really focusing on the company's cash flow generation as a major yardstick of its viability."	Embattled commodities trader Noble Group is set to post its first full-year loss in nearly two decades because of the collapse in coal prices.
Glamorgan were beaten in under two-and-a-half days against Worcestershire having failed to last two days in their opening loss at Northamptonshire. Rudolph says discussions have been held with the senior players and head coach Robert Croft. "We've had some good, strong conversations," Rudolph said. "I think it's important for the senior players in the team to stand up. "We have a good blend of senior players and a lot of young Welsh talent in the likes of Aneurin Donald and Kiran Carlson. "We've refocused and we're ready for Friday's game against Leicestershire and it will be nice to start off with a win. "I've always been of the belief that in County Cricket as soon as you can gather some momentum you've got to try and carry it on for a long time." Glamorgan were beaten by an innings and 22 runs by Northants in their opening game of the season before an eight-wicket loss at home to Worcestershire. Despite his side's poor start to the season, South African Rudolph still believes Glamorgan can make an impression in Division Two of the County Championship. "If you look at last season we started with three losses and during the season there were about three or four games where we just missed out on winning opportunities," Rudolph told BBC Radio Wales Sport. "If that had happened we would still have finished in the top three or four so it's not all doom and gloom at the moment."	Captain Jacques Rudolph has said Glamorgan's senior players need to "stand up" after the county's poor start to the Championship season.
Michael Salmon, 30, used his position as freelance producer of a show, "Cosy", at Cardiff's Millennium Centre, to obtain grants. Some grants came from the Arts Council of Wales and Arts Unlimited, set up to fund projects with disabled performers. Salmon, from Grangetown, Cardiff, admitted five counts of fraud. The court heard that he used £9,000 to fund his own lifestyle, mainly on trips to London. But most of the money he defrauded was lost by his own mismanagement of several theatrical projects. One grant of £30,000 was obtained by falsifying a bank statement. The deception took place between May 2015 and February 2016. Jailing Salmon, Judge Paul Lewis QC said he had lied to theatrical directors who had gone to him for help in raising grants for their productions. He said: "This was public money intended for good causes which never reached them. "There was substantial financial mismanagement with money being transferred from one project to another when it shouldn't have been."	An independent theatre producer who fraudulently claimed £65,000 in grants has been jailed for 18 months at Cardiff Crown Court.
Many of the elements that make up the foundation of the modern world originated in China, including paper, gunpowder, credit banking, the compass and paper money. China stagnated for more than two decades under the rigid Communist rule of the founder of the People's Republic, Mao Zedong. But China now has the world's fastest-growing economy and is undergoing what has been described as a second industrial revolution. It has also launched an ambitious space exploration programme, involving plans to set up a space station by 2020. The People's Republic of China (PRC) was founded in 1949 after the Communist Party defeated the previously dominant nationalist Kuomintang in a civil war. The Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan, creating two rival Chinese states - the PRC on the mainland and the Republic of China based on Taiwan. China profile - home Country profiles - home Country profiles compiled by BBC Monitoring Beijing says the island of Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory that must be reunited with the mainland. The claim has in the past led to tension and threats of invasion, but since 2008 the two governments have moved towards a more cooperative atmosphere. The leadership of Mao Zedong oversaw the often brutal implementation of a Communist vision of society. Millions died in the Great Leap Forward - a programme of state control over agriculture and rapid industrialisation - and the Cultural Revolution, a chaotic attempt to root out elements seen as hostile to Communist rule. However, Mao's death in 1976 ushered in a new leadership and economic reform. In the early 1980s the government dismantled collective farming and again allowed private enterprise. The rate of economic change has not been matched by political reform, with the Communist Party - the world's largest political party - retaining its monopoly on power and maintaining strict control over the people. The authorities still crack down on any signs of opposition and send outspoken dissidents to labour camps. Nowadays China is one of the world's top exporters and is attracting record amounts of foreign investment. In turn, it is investing billions of dollars abroad. The collapse in international export markets that accompanied the global financial crisis of 2009 initially hit China hard, but its economy was among the first in the world to rebound, quickly returning to growth. In February 2011 it formally overtook Japan to become the world's second-largest economy, though by early 2012 the debt crisis in the eurozone - one of the biggest markets for Chinese goods - was beginning to act as a drag on China's growth. As a member of the World Trade Organisation, China benefits from access to foreign markets. But relations with trading partners have been strained over China's huge trade surplus and the piracy of goods. The former has led to demands for Beijing to raise the value of its currency, the renminbi, which would make Chinese goods more expensive for foreign buyers and possibly hold back exports. Beijing has responded with a gradual easing of restrictions on trading in the currency. Some Chinese fear that the rise of private enterprise and the demise of state-run industries carries heavy social costs such as unemployment and instability. Moreover, the fast-growing economy has fuelled the demand for energy. China is the largest oil consumer after the US, and the world's biggest producer and consumer of coal. It spends billions of dollars in pursuit of foreign energy supplies. There has been a massive investment in hydro-power, including the $25bn Three Gorges Dam project. The economic disparity between urban China and the rural hinterlands is among the largest in the world. In recent decades many impoverished rural dwellers have flocked to the country's eastern cities, which have enjoyed a construction boom. By the beginning of 2012, city dwellers appeared to outnumber the rural population for the first time, according to official figures. Social discontent manifests itself in protests by farmers and workers. Tens of thousands of people travel to Beijing each year to lodge petitions with the authorities in the hope of finding redress for alleged corruption, land seizures and evictions. Other pressing problems include corruption, which affects every level of society, and the growing rate of HIV infection. A downside of the economic boom has been environmental degradation; China is home to many of the world's most-polluted cities. Human rights campaigners continue to criticise China for executing hundreds of people every year and for failing to stop torture, as well as for continuing to censor political and artistic expression. The country is keen to stamp down on what it sees as dissent among its ethnic minorities, including Muslim Uighurs in the north-west. Chinese rule over Tibet is controversial. Human rights groups accuse the authorities of the systematic destruction of Tibetan Buddhist culture and the persecution of monks loyal to the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader who is campaigning for autonomy within China.	China is the world's most populous country, with a continuous culture stretching back nearly 4,000 years.
Gerry McGowan, Michael Toner, Stephen Crumlish and Gerard Kelly were all teenagers when they were accused of killing Lt Steven Kirby in 1979. The so-called Derry Four fled Northern Ireland until their acquittal in 1998. They are now involved in a civil case against the police for wrongful arrest. They four men also say they were subjected to false imprisonment, assault, battery and malicious prosecution. The PSNI told the BBC it would be inappropriate to comment due to legal proceedings. On Friday, lawyers for the PSNI chief constable submitted documents to the High Court in Belfast indicating that all original interview notes from 1979 were missing. "I suppose my first reaction was one of disbelief but at the same time it was not surprising," said Gerry McGowan. "These documents could have been forensically tested to determine whether the statements were tampered with. "Were they wilfully destroyed or was it just complete incompetence?" It is understood that no explanation was provided as to how the notes had gone missing. It is yet another twist in a long battle for justice, according to Paul O'Connor from the Pat Finucane Centre. "It is an incredible coincidence that in this particular case the interview notes have gone missing," he said. "It would be vital to get to the bottom of this to see what was written in the original interview notes and this is quite a blow for them. "My heart goes out to the four men, clearly they have been vindicated in terms of having the charges withdrawn but they've had no justice." The four men have now lodged an application for the release of covert tape recordings of the interviews, which they believed were made by the security services.	One of four men wrongly accused of murdering a British soldier has said he is "devastated, but not surprised" to learn that interview notes relating to the case have gone missing.

McKee netted the opener and Eugene Magee slotted home before O'Donoghue's drag-flick made it 3-0 at half-time. O'Donoghue added the fourth and, after Patryk Bulka pulled one back, McKee netted to seal victory. Ireland face Wales in Saturday's semi-final with the winners guaranteed a spot in the final and World League 3. France and Scotland will contest the other semi-final at the east Belfast venue. "In a must-win game, there will always be tension. These are difficult games - it's a quarter-final and must-win," said Ireland coach Craig Fulton. Media playback is not supported on this device "Whether you play beautifully or it's pretty, it doesn't matter. The result is everything.

The fishermen aboard the St Apollo escaped into their life raft during the incident early on Monday. A rescue helicopter was sent from Prestwick but the group were reached first by the Oban lifeboat at about 03:30. They were taken ashore at Oban. It's thought no one was been injured.	Five people have been rescued after their fishing vessel ran aground and capsized in the Sound of Mull.
Gatland says he will step down after the 2019 Rugby World Cup. The 52-year-old hopes to coach in his homeland once that deal expires and Brooke says he could be a candidate for the national side by then. "Warren Gatland's certainly got the capabilities of dealing with that," he said. "It's all about managing the players and he's been an All Black himself, so he knows what's required of a player. "His coaching credentials have been built through coaching in the UK. He's a quality guy and a very good coach." Two of Gatland's Wales predecessors and fellow countrymen, Sir Graham Henry and Steve Hansen, went on to coach the All Blacks. Hansen emulated Henry's exploits of 2011 by guiding New Zealand to a third World Cup with victory over Australia in the 2015 final. His contract expires in 2017 and Hansen expects to step down before New Zealand defend their title two years later. Since taking over in December 2007, Gatland has led Wales to two Grand Slams and become the longest-serving coach in their history. His deal expires after the tournament in Japan and he plans to return to his homeland, where he previously coached his native Waikato after spells with Ireland and Wasps. Waikato Chiefs chief executive Andrew Flexman says Gatland would walk into a job in Super Rugby. "He's about as credentialed as you can get and certainly in Chiefs country he's considered to be right up there," Flexman told BBC Radio Wales Sport. "We're pretty excited to hear that he's interested in rounding out his coaching career in this country. "Depending on what the lie of the land looks like for us in the future, we'd certainly engage him in a conversation around that."	Wales head coach Warren Gatland has the credentials to be All Blacks coach, according to ex-New Zealand forward Zinzan Brooke.
It happened at about 16:00 BST on Saturday - the blaze spread from one house to neighbouring properties in Ballyoran Park. It gutted one house and badly damaged two others. No-one was injured, but two dogs died as the fire spread. At this stage police have said they are not treating the fire as suspicious. Fire station commander William Weir said five pumps were brought in to bring it under control. "On arrival the first crews found two houses well alight and the fire spreading either side of them along a row of five terrace houses," he said. "It quickly became apparent that there was an oil tank involved which had allowed its contents to ignite which spread to a second oil tank in the house next door which then further added fuel to quite a large fire. "The fuel then followed through the gardens of the remaining houses in the street and set fire to a further six garden sheds and some fencing. "It was quite a large fire and it took crews approximately 35 to 40 minutes of hard fire fighting to stop it spreading to the other properties and to bring it under control and extinguish it." Mr Weir said an investigation by the fire service and police had concluded that the blaze had started accidentally. "Basically what happened was that some rubbish in the garden which had been burnt earlier in the day and left unattended re-ignited and set fire to a fence and then compromised the oil tank allowing its contents to become involved in the fire and from then the fire grew in intensity," he added.	A number of homes and gardens have been damaged in a fire in Portadown, County Armagh, after an oil tank caught alight.
A total of 387 people were arrested between February 2016 and February 2017 - up from 255 the previous year. Meanwhile more than half of cabin crew who responded to a survey said they had witnessed disruptive drunken passenger behaviour at UK airports. The Home Office is "considering" calls for tougher rules on alcohol. The arrest figures obtained by Panorama came from 18 out of the 20 police forces with a major airport in their area. Trade body Airlines UK said it should be made illegal for people to drink their own alcohol on board a plane. A total of 19,000 of the Unite union's cabin crew members were surveyed and 4,000 responded, with one in five saying they had suffered physical abuse. A former cabin crew manager with Virgin, Ally Murphy, quit her job last October after 14 years and told Panorama: "People just see us as barmaids in the sky. "They would touch your breasts, or they'd touch your bum or your legs. I've had hands going up my skirt before." In July 2016 the aviation industry introduced a voluntary code of conduct on disruptive passengers, which most of the big airlines and airports signed up to. The code's advice included asking retailers to warn passengers not to consume duty-free purchases on the plane, while staff are also asked not to sell alcohol to passengers who appear drunk. Panorama found more than a quarter of cabin crew surveyed were unaware of the code of practice and, of those who had heard of it, only 23% thought it was working. One anonymous crew member told Panorama: "The code of conduct isn't working… We're seeing these incidents on a daily, a weekly, a monthly basis. It's the alcohol mainly in the duty free that is the significant problem." Sources: Airlines UK* and UK Travel Retail Forum** Manchester Airport is one of the signatories but when Panorama's undercover reporter asked at World Duty Free whether she could open alcohol bought at a duty-free shop to consume on the plane, she was told "officially probably not, unofficially I think you'll get away with it". Another shop in the airport did give the right advice. World Duty Free said it was committed to dealing with the issue and that it displays "clear advisory notices at till points, on till receipts and on carrier bags that remind customers that alcohol purchases cannot be opened until their final destination is reached". Airlines UK, which represents carriers such as Virgin, British Airways and EasyJet, wants the government to amend the law to make consumption of a passenger's own alcohol on board an aircraft a criminal offence. Airlines can limit the amount of alcohol sold to passengers on board flights. Low-cost airline Jet2 has already banned alcohol sales on flights before 08:00 and managing director Phil Ward agreed further action was needed. "I think they [airports] could do more. I think the retailers could do more as well. "Two litre steins of beer in bars, mixes and miniatures in duty free shops, which can only be there for one reason - you know, they're items that are not sold on the high street. "We can't allow it not to change." A House of Lords committee report earlier this year called for tougher rules on the sale of alcohol at airports. Committee chair Baroness McIntosh of Pickering said: "We didn't hear one shred of evidence to show the voluntary code was either working now or had any possible vestige of success in working any time soon." The Home Office said it was considering the report's recommendations, which include revoking the airports' exemption from the Licensing Act, "and will respond in due course". Karen Dee, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, said: "I don't accept that the airports don't sell alcohol responsibly. The sale of alcohol per se is not a problem. It's the misuse of it and drinking to excess and then behaving badly." She said they were working with retailers and staff to make sure they understand the rules.	Arrests of passengers suspected of being drunk at UK airports and on flights have risen by 50% in a year, a Panorama investigation has revealed.
The singer told The Sun he had performed 10 concerts in "agony" on his European tour before he called in doctors. "I was a ticking time bomb. I guess I could have died at any time," he said. According to his website, he is on a course of "intensive antibiotics" and is expected to undergo surgery "in the coming weeks". Sir Elton has had to postpone a series of summer festival dates including shows in Italy, Germany and London's Hyde Park this week. A spokesman said the diagnosis had been made "following a number of exploratory scans and blood tests with his medical team in the UK". He confirmed the singer would not return to touring until he had fully recovered from both the planned surgery and any damage caused by the appendix abscess. "Elton is incredibly disappointed to postpone these tour dates," he said. "To know that he made such super-human efforts and continued to perform to thousands through his illness only confirms his dedication to his European fans. "He is eager to be back on top form and return to play the remaining shows starting in early September 2013." Sir Elton had been due to perform at the Collisioni festival in Italy on Tuesday, with further shows in Germany on Thursday and a headline gig at London's Hyde Park on Friday. British Summer Time festival organisers AEG Live said the Hyde Park show would still go ahead with Elvis Costello and former Kinks frontman Ray Davies on the bill, with existing ticket holders receiving a full refund. Other July dates now scrapped include festivals in Spain, France and Monaco. Sir Elton is due back in the UK in September, performing at the First Direct Arena in Leeds and at Bestival before heading back to Las Vegas for a month-long residency at The Colosseum.	Sir Elton John has said he is "lucky to be alive" after being diagnosed with appendicitis.
Concerns had been raised by the Pakistan Cricket Board over threats from Hindu extremists, who attacked the offices of Indian cricket's governing body last year. However, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said on Thursday that the team had been cleared to play in March and April. "I am pleased that our government has given its consent," said Shaharyar. "As a duty of care, we have asked [world cricket governing body] the ICC to put in place special arrangements for the Pakistan cricket team while in India." India and Pakistan have not played a Test series since 2007 due to fallout from the terrorist attacks on Mumbai in 2008, blamed on militants based across the border. Since 2009, Pakistan have played their 'home' Test series in the UAE after a terrorist attack on the visiting Sri Lankan team led to a boycott on tours to the country. The World T20 runs from 8 March to 3 April. Pakistan are scheduled to play a qualifier team on 16 March in Kolkata, then hosts India on 19 March in Dharamsala.	Pakistan will play in the World Twenty20 after the government approved their participation in India.
A white BMW 420 coupe struck the woman under a railway bridge on Bradford Road, Dewsbury at about 10:10 GMT, police said. The road was closed for four hours, with a section of the nearby Lidl car park also cordoned off. The arrested 21-year-old man remains in police custody for questioning. Sgt Carl Quinn, of West Yorkshire Police, said: "Anyone who saw the collision or the manner in which the BMW was being driven prior to it, is asked to contact the major collision and enquiry team."	A man has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving after a woman was run over near a supermarket in West Yorkshire.
"The documentary for me started with the questions: 'Is this the end of film? Is digital going to replace it? What are we losing if that happens and what are we gaining?,'" says Keanu Reeves. The actor serves as producer, narrator and interviewer on Side by Side, in which he sets out to examine cinema's transition from film to digital formats. It seems a niche subject, but Reeves and director Chris Kenneally say they were conscious about making the film for a mainstream audience. "We wanted to take something that was quite specialised and share enough information so people could understand what we'd be speaking about," Reeves says. But does the average cinema-goer care or notice what format the film they're watching is in? "If you're not an aficionado, probably not, as long as it was working," admits Reeves. "If you go and expect to see a Hollywood studio movie and it looked terrible you'd go like, 'what is that?' So I think it could impact in that sense. "But a perfect film print projected is something that is remarkable and unique." Side By Side makes no assumptions that audiences will know the technical aspects of filmmaking, so spends some time explaining how cameras work, the photochemical process of developing film and how the introduction of digital cameras has led to the progression of editing and special effects. And helping to explain is a cast that reads like a Who's Who of cinema. Directors Martin Scorsese, Christopher Nolan, David Fincher, David Lynch, James Cameron, Danny Boyle, George Lucas and cinematographers Wally Pfister (Inception, The Dark Knight) and Roger Deakins (Skyfall, True Grit) are all present. Female filmmakers are represented by the likes of legendary editor Anne Coates, who worked on movies like Lawrence of Arabia and The Elephant Man and Lena Dunham, one of Hollywood's hottest talents thanks to her TV show Girls. Reeves conducted a large share of the interviews himself, which not only helped the filmmakers gain such unprecedented access but also made for a series of relaxed, open conversations. "I can't say it didn't help that I've been in the industry for however many years - I was a known quantity in that sense," he says. It took around 18 months to round up and interview all the film-makers. Luckily, a large number of contributors attended an annual cinematography festival in Poland. However others weren't so easy to get. Directors such as Steven Spielberg and Quentin Tarantino are notably absent. "There were people who weren't available or who didn't want to speak," he says. "We got turned down a few times which sucked." Although mainstream Hollywood films have been shot digitally for about the last 12 years, the first digital film to win an Oscar for best cinematography was Slumdog Millionaire in 2009. Cinematography Oscars followed for Avatar in 2010 and Hugo in 2011 - also shot digitally. Some see this as a shift in the attitude towards digital film, which had previously been considered inferior in quality. Filming on celluloid is an expensive and time consuming process. Reels of film that each contain about 10 minutes of footage are developed overnight, creating "dailies". Viewing them is the first chance a director will get to see the product of his previous day's work. It is only then they discover if they have the right shots or if they have to go back and re-shoot. The advent of video cameras showed not only that film-making could be done at a fraction of the cost, but that you could see the results immediately. It also enabled anyone to effectively become a film-maker. The invention of low price digital cameras further democratised the film-making process. However, advocates for celluloid include Inception director Christopher Nolan and cinematographer Wally Pfister, who maintain digital images will never have the depth or clarity of film, which they insist on using. On the other side, the likes of George Lucas, James Cameron and David Lynch profess their love for digital and swear they'll never go back. Another issue addressed in the documentary is digital film archiving and preservation - where the introduction of new formats every couple of years is proving to be problematic. Indeed, Se7en director David Fincher says he has videos from the early days of his career in unplayable formats, as the hardware no longer exists. As a result, when he finishes a film, he now stores the relevant player alongside the rushes in his archive, to ensure he is able to watch them back at a later date. And even with modern technology, hard drives can fail, leading to the loss of digital content. It is something Reeves admits he had not considered. "I had no idea about the situation we're in right now where there is no standardised means of archiving digital information." "I didn't know anything about how it could all just go away - it was a bit jaw-dropping." The irony is that celluloid is the only format that has stood the test of time over the past 100 years and will continue to do so as long as there are projectors to play them on. Throughout Side by Side, Reeves maintains his impartiality but with filming complete, he is able to share his thoughts. "Going into the film I was definitely biased to 'what are we losing?'. Film was being held up as the gold standard and digital was this idea of replacing [it]," he says. "But what I've come to learn is that it's not necessarily replacing it - but that it's something else. And if it is that, then film has a better chance. "I'm still confident that it's going to hang around." Side By Side is out in cinemas from Friday, 15 February through Axiom Films.	Documentary Side by Side looks at the history of film-making and whether the advent of digital technology spells the end of celluloid.
Earlier this week, he refused to answer the question of whether he believed homosexual sex was a sin. But he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show he was "passionate about LGBT-plus rights" and defending equal marriage would be "at the top of my agenda". He also said he wanted to extend the marital rights of transgender people. Appearing on Channel 4 News on Friday, Mr Farron, who beat Norman Lamb to the leadership, was asked three times if he believed homosexual sex was a sin. Each time, he refused to give a direct answer, instead choosing to say "my firm belief is we are all sinners". Mr Farron was asked by Andrew Marr why he voted against the Equality Bill in 2007 - a law which would have made it harder for businesses to discriminate against gay people. "Let me be crystal clear, I'm a liberal and I absolutely support equality," he replied. "I'm passionate about LGBT-plus rights, for example, and as the leader of a liberal party, that is something that will be at the top of my agenda throughout the time that I am leader of our party. "Not just defending the law on equal marriage, but also saying there are areas where it needs to be extended." Mr Farron said transgender people currently did not have equal access to marriage due to something known as the spousal veto - which means the husband or wife of someone who has changed gender must give their consent in order for the marriage to continue. He said the Lib Dems tabled an amendment to the Equality Bill because of concerns about "protection of individual liberties" and when that was defeated he voted against the bill. He did not answer directly when asked what those concerns were, but said: "I am absolutely in favour of equal access under law for all people whatever their sexuality."	New Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron says he "absolutely supports equality" amid questions over his Christian faith and politics.
In a bid to promote password security, Strathclyde University produced a poster saying: "Bet Jennifer Lawrence wishes she'd used a StR0nG_Pas5w0Rd%." The image attracted criticism on social media, with the Glasgow-based university accused of "victim blaming". The university said the poster had been removed and should not have been made. An image of the poster was tweeted on Monday by Billy McCauley who said: "Pretty shocking victim blaming here. Will you take it down?" A short time later, Strathclyde University tweeted: "The posters are being removed now. They should not have produced and we are looking into how this happened." A spokesman for the university later said: "The posters are in bad taste and have now been removed from campus. The sentiment expressed is not consistent with the values of this university." Dozens of private pictures of Hunger Games actress Lawrence were released on the internet in September. Other celebrities targeted in the leaks included Rihanna, Kate Upton, Selena Gomez and Kim Kardashian. It is thought the photos were taken off the stars' iCloud accounts and were shared on other websites.	A university has withdrawn a poster which appeared to ridicule Hollywood star Jennifer Lawrence after her nude pictures were leaked on the internet.
A Wallabies win will knock England out of the World Cup and send Wales, who beat Fiji 23-13 on Thursday, through to the quarter-finals. New Zealander Gatland said: "If we were being selfish about our own destiny Australia can do us a big favour. "But it's a bit hard for a Kiwi to be cheering Aussies, so I think I'll be quite neutral for this weekend." Media playback is not supported on this device Wales's win over Fiji saw them move to the top of Pool A on 13 points - four ahead of Australia and seven in front of England. Wales, England and Australia can all still qualify for the quarter-finals but only the top two in Pool A will go through. With four points for a win, one bonus point for a team that scores four or more tries in a match, and one point if you lose by seven points or fewer, the permutations are many. If England beat Australia, then the tournament hosts will be favourites as their final game on 10 October is against minnows Uruguay - both Wales and the Wallabies recorded bonus-point victories over the South American side. A bonus-point win for England would mean the match between Australia and Wales, earlier on the same day at Twickenham, would decide the other qualifier from the so-called pool of death. There is a scenario that could see Wales and England finish on the same points. If that were to happen, Wales would go through because they won last Saturday's pool match. Should Australia lose to England and then beat Wales there is also the possibility of all three teams finishing on the same points and then points difference comes into play. The Welsh have lost their last 10 meetings with Australia, but captain Sam Warburton believes there has been little between the teams. The last five meetings between the sides have seen the Wallabies win by five points or fewer. "We take a lot of confidence from those defeats because it's been a penalty decision, or one guy coming out of the line in the last minute - really the finest margins you can probably get in Test rugby," said Warburton. "So we know that we have the makings to get a win against Australia, but I've seen some of their games recently and they are looking particularly good. "It's going to be another huge battle between England and Australia and then between us and Australia - it's going to be an exciting week."	Wales coach Warren Gatland admitted he will find it hard to support Australia when they play England on Saturday.
Carwyn Jones told The Guardian newspaper that people's "sense of disengagement with Brussels" could attach itself to London after Brexit. The UK government said it will trigger the Article 50 process on March 29. Mrs May, visiting Swansea, promised to seek the "best possible deal" that would work for everyone across the UK. Mr Jones told The Guardian the prime minister had a "tin ear" on matters of devolution. He warned the future of the UK could be under threat if the UK government did not listen to the other administrations. "If they are not careful, people's sense of disengagement with Brussels will simply attach itself to London," he said. "They are giving the impression sometimes that they do not listen. "And what kind of message is that to the people of Wales?" Amid calls in Scotland for a second referendum on independence, the first minister said Wales needed to see a "dividend" for his government's continued support of a United Kingdom. "Otherwise people in Wales are going to start saying, well, the government is listening to the Scots, we need to be like them," he said. "And that's a dangerous path for the UK." Last week, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced her intention to seek approval for a second independence referendum, to be held between Autumn 2018 and Spring 2019. Mr Jones met Mrs May in her visit to Swansea on Monday, during which she also signed the Â£1.3bn Swansea Bay Region city deal. Following the meeting, the first minister said the talks had been "constructive". "It was made clear that Welsh interventions had helped change and strengthen the UK positions on transition arrangements and on workers' rights," Mr Jones said. He called for more "partnership working" in the vein of the city deal as Article 50 approaches. Mrs May said she wanted to get "the best possible deal for the United Kingdom that works for everyone across the United Kingdom". She said the objectives included a "good free trade deal" and co-operation on matters such as security. Later in the afternoon, Mr Jones warned the assembly's constitutional and legislative affairs committee there could be Supreme Court challenges if the UK government took back powers from Europe and then decided which were to be devolved. "I think that's wrong," he said. "That's not the way we read our devolution settlement. It is the way that many in the UK government see it." He also told the committee, meeting in Newport, that it was "not always clear" that the Wales Office had "much influence" within the UK government.	Welsh support for the UK could be in doubt if Theresa May does not listen to concerns about devolution, the first minister has warned.
The 20-year-old follows Danny Ward from Anfield to the Scottish Premiership, the goalkeeper having been with the Dons since the start of the season. Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes told the club website: "He's a player who has always impressed us and will give us good options in the months ahead." The Northern Ireland international joined Liverpool from Glenavon aged 16. He has yet to make his competitive debut for the Premier League side but made nine appearances while on loan to Barnsley in the Championship in the second half of the 2013-14 season. That led to the first of three international caps and his only senior appearance last season was in a 1-0 friendly defeat by Scotland. "Ryan has the quality needed to play with us at Aberdeen and we are looking forward to working closely with him," added McInnes. "Ryan's eagerness to join us over others also give us great encouragement." McLaughlin's older brother, Conor, is also a right-back, with League One club Fleetwood Town, and has six Northern Ireland caps.	Liverpool right-back Ryan McLaughlin has joined Aberdeen on loan until January.
On Thursday, a human skull was found alongside the M54 slip road by workers doing a survey of the junction four roundabout, near Telford. Police confirmed the skull was that of an adult male and had been there for at least two years. West Mercia Police said "further skeletal remains" were found close to the skull. The eastbound entry slip road remains partially closed. Det Chief Insp Neil Jamieson said: "We are in the very early stages of this investigation and inquiries are ongoing." He said further forensic examinations and excavations were being carried out and police had been in contact with neighbouring forces asking for information about people who had been reported missing. Archaeological experts may be called in to help with the investigation. "This will be a lengthy process but we will continue to update the public in due course," he added.	More human remains have been found near a motorway slip road in Shropshire, police have said.
The Boeing 767 bound for Miami experienced an "uncontained engine failure", officials involved in the investigation said. The pilot aborted the take-off and evacuated everyone on board via emergency chutes as black smoke billowed from the plane. Twenty people suffered minor injuries, the fire department said. Nine crew members and 161 passengers were on board. A federal official quoted by the Associated Press news agency said the plane appeared to have suffered a rare and serious type of engine failure in which parts break off and are spewed outside the engine. Passengers reported an explosion followed by flames and black smoke as the plane was speeding down the runway. Sarah Ahmed said everyone on the right side of the plane rushed from their seats and moved to the left side. "People are yelling, 'Open the door! Open the door!' Everyone's screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door," she told WLS-TV. "Within that time, I think it was seven seconds, there was smoke in the plane and the fire is right up against the windows, and it's melting the windows." The incident took place at 14:35 local time (19:35 GMT). An initial statement by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the plane had burst a tyre, but that information was later deleted from the statement. Why do people grab their bags after a plane crash? American Airlines said passengers who still wanted to travel had been put on another flight to Miami. Elsewhere, a FedEx plane caught fire at Fort Lauderdale, Florida, airport after its landing gear collapsed on landing, the FAA said.	An American Airlines plane has caught fire on the runway of Chicago's O'Hare airport while taking off.
Media playback is not supported on this device Now, he has to find a replacement for the German as team-mate to Lewis Hamilton. And at this late stage of the year, it will be no easy task. So who will be on Wolff's shortlist and how likely are they to get the seat? This is the fight many would like to see. Hamilton and Alonso are regarded as the two towering talents of their generation and their intense battle as McLaren team-mates in 2007 was cut short by Alonso falling out with boss Ron Dennis and leaving the team. They ended that year tied on points, one behind world champion Kimi Raikkonen, with four wins each. Round two would be the biggest box office F1 could hope for, but it is highly unlikely to happen for two reasons: 1) Alonso is under contract to McLaren and even if he has a break clause - which they say he does not - they would not want to let him go; 2) More importantly, Wolff knows that the problems he had with Hamilton and Rosberg would pale compared to the potential difficulties of handling Hamilton and Alonso. Chances of it happening: 6/10 The Australian was the choice of many observers as the driver of 2016, and Wolff is a big fan. The on-track battle with Hamilton would be intense, but Ricciardo is a laid-back character and would probably be easier to handle off it. But he is under contract to Red Bull until 2018. Red Bull says they have no intention of letting him go, but if Wolff approached them there is just the possibility that they may consider selling Ricciardo. Why? Because most accept that, long term, Ricciardo and Max Verstappen is not a sustainable line-up - if Red Bull become title contenders their relationship is very likely to become incendiary. Chances: 6/10 Verstappen is the big rising star of F1. Shaded by Ricciardo over 2016 as a whole, performances such as his stunning drive in the wet in Brazil last month mark him out as a future world champion. Wolff would be very interested but, like Ricciardo, Verstappen is under contract to Red Bull - in his case to the end of 2019. And Red Bull are even more in love with the Dutchman than they are with Ricciardo. Chances: 4/10 Vettel's love affair with Ferrari - and vice versa - is long over after a difficult and disappointing season. Relations with team boss Maurizio Arrivabene are frayed - especially since the Italian said the four-time champion should focus more on his driving and needed to "earn" a new contract beyond 2017. And Vettel was unhappy with the decision to split with technical director James Allison in the summer. Likewise, Ferrari have been confused how, after a year and a half of easily beating team-mate Kimi Raikkonen, Vettel's form slipped in the second half of 2016 - although they might want to read the previous paragraph for an answer. Vettel has been shopping around for a move and would almost certainly welcome a switch to Mercedes. But there are some problems: 1) his contract runs to the end of 2017 and there is no obvious replacement for Ferrari; 2) he might not fancy going up against Hamilton; 3) Vettel and Hamilton together is almost as much of a recipe for trouble as Hamilton and Alonso. Chances of it happening: 8/10 Wolff has a long relationship with Bottas as part of his management team and rates him highly. The Finn has impressed in the last four seasons with Williams and would be a low-maintenance choice. He would deliver solid results on track and is calm and would not rock the boat off it. Next year is the last year of his contract at Williams. The team is not the most flush with cash in the pit lane and Wolff would almost certainly be able to put together an attractive deal - either for a cash payment to release Bottas or a reduction in Williams' engine fee. But Williams have an 18-year-old rookie in the well-resourced Canadian Lance Stroll in their other car next year and need experience in the lead car. Wolff could offer them Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein, who raced for Manor in 2016, in exchange. But would Williams accept? Felipe Nasr, who raced for Sauber in 2016, would also be an option for them, and please F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone, who needs a Brazilian in the sport to satisfy its largest single TV audience. Chances: 9/10 The German is the obvious choice - he is Mercedes' reserve driver, he has tested for the team several times, and he is a free agent. But he has only one season's race experience, and although he has put in some promising drives, he has had a few shaky ones as well. Putting him in a race-winning car with Hamilton as his team-mate would be a big ask. And that's without even considering his personality. Insiders say Wehrlein can be difficult and self-centred, and Wolff will be wary of putting such a character alongside Hamilton. Chances: 8/10 Another Mercedes young driver, Ocon has impressed in his half-season alongside Wehrlein at Manor - so much so that Force India picked him rather than the German as their second driver alongside Sergio Perez for 2017. But Ocon has only nine races under his belt and it's surely too early for him to get a seat at the factory Mercedes team. Chances: 7/10 A left-field choice, the Scot has been out of F1 for two years now. But he was Williams reserve driver this year and is a Mercedes-contracted driver in the DTM German Touring Car Championship and would be a solid option. Chances: 5/10 Button has retired from F1, but remains contracted to McLaren. He made it very clear in the last few weeks that he needed a break from the sport. Chances: 1/10 The German has just signed a three-year deal with Renault, but the French company and Mercedes have links on a corporate level and Wolff is close friends with their racing boss Frederic Vasseur. But taking Hulkenberg would leave Renault with a vacancy that would be tough to fill and Wolff is not overly enamoured with him either. Chances: 2/10	Mercedes Formula 1 boss Toto Wolff admits that Nico Rosberg's decision to retire took him completely by surprise - but it is only the start of his problems.
Liberty, headed by Sanjeev Gupta, was first to express an interest in the assets when they were put up for sale. A spokesman for Liberty told the BBC that the firm had put together a team of advisers and financial backers. "The formal process is to submit a letter of intent; it amounts to a bid. It will be done on Tuesday," he said. In addition to the Port Talbot factory - the UK's largest steelworks - Tata's remaining assets include sites at Newport, where more than 1,300 people are employed, and Rotherham, which employs 1,200. Tata also has operations at Corby, Shotton and Teesside. Macquarie, the Australian bank, was advising Liberty on a potential bid, and is considered a potential financial backer of any takeover. Liberty House started life in the university room of Indian-born founder Sanjeev Gupta. While a student at Cambridge University in 1992, the budding entrepreneur started what has since become a global steel and commodities business with annual sales of more than £2bn. With operations in 30 countries, and headquarters in London, Dubai, and Singapore, Mr Gupta's Liberty has also emerged as a possible saviour of Britain's steel industry. Liberty's focus is on recycling the mountains of scrap metal generated in the UK, rather than the historical method of producing steel in blast furnaces. Last month, it acquired Tata Steel's plants in Lanarkshire. In recent years, it has reached similar deals for steel plants in Newport and the Black Country. A management buyout team is also planning to submit a bid under the name Excalibur Steel UK Limited. It has appointed investment banker Mark Rhydderch-Roberts as a non-executive director. He joins Stuart Wilkie, the head of Tata's United Kingdom strip steel business, and former Alcan senior executive and venture capitalist Roger Maggs, on the board. The government has promised to support any buyer of the business by taking up to a 25% stake in a new business and making hundreds of millions of pounds of finance available. Tata has not publicly set a deadline for any deal, but has made it clear it cannot sustain its £1m-a-day losses indefinitely and does not want to prolong the uncertainty for workers and customers. Tata's Scunthorpe operation, which employs more than 3,000 people, has been sold to investment firm Greybull Capital for a nominal £1.	Liberty House plans to submit a formal bid on Tuesday to buy Tata Steel's UK assets, which include the Port Talbot works employing about 4,000 people.
By convention these are relatively uncontroversial and involve saying something nice about your predecessor despite political differences with them. Cardiff North Labour MP MP Anna McMorrin found some warm words about the Conservative whose job she took. "I know how hard Craig worked to represent the constituency over the past two years," she told MPs on Monday. Gower Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi didn't mention Byron Davies by name but said on Thursday: "I would also like to pay tribute to my predecessor who served the constituency to the best of his ability." Ms McMorrin went on to give her analysis of the Brexit referendum vote - her city voted to remain in the EU. "The vote in many parts of Wales was not a vote against Europe or the concept or the reality of the European Union," she said. "It was a vote against politicsâ€”against the reality of the decisions taken here. "The cumulative impact of benefit cuts and reductions in public spending has hit the poorest hardest, so I intend to use my time here to speak up against a failed austerity where the richest people have forced the poorest people to pay the price." She added her name to an amendment to the Queen's Speech calling for the UK to remain inside the single market and the customs union." Ms Antoniazzi used her speech to oppose fracking and urge ministers to sign off the proposed Swansea tidal lagoon. She also reflected on her own heritage. "My Italian family name is embedded in the Gower constituency," she said. "The introduction of cafe culture to the people of South Wales comes predominantly from the families of Bardi - and yes, you have ice cream to thank me for." Business Secretary Greg Clark told her he had sampled some of that ice cream while campaigning for her predecessor. A friend had found that "Gower" and "Tonia" were searched for more than 20 times on her daughter's tablet computer. "When questioned she told her mother, isn't it amazing that we live somewhere that anyone can become an MP you don't have to be rich, you don't have to go to a posh school you just have to work hard. "And with more than 20 years as a teacher Amelie's words ring so true for the schoolchildren of Gower, Wales and the United Kingdom because ambition is critical," she added.	Three weeks after the general election, and a week after the state opening of Parliament, new MPs have been busy making their maiden speeches in the House of Commons.
The France midfielder has accepted a violent conduct charge for the incident during Saturday's goalless draw. Sissoko, 27, apologised but was charged by the Football Association. Spurs will not appeal against the decision. His suspension will include Tuesday's EFL Cup tie at Liverpool, plus league games against Leicester and Arsenal. The FA said the incident was missed by match officials. "I need to say the elbow was in the face of Arter and it is clear," Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino said on Monday. "We are in a period where we need all the squad, all the players to compete. It's difficult now because he is a player who was in our plans to play tomorrow, so we have to change a little bit." Speaking to Match of the Day after Saturday's game, Arter said he was happy to accept Sissoko's explanation that the contact was accidental. He said: "I never want to see a player get into trouble if they didn't mean to. Sissoko apologised. I'm happy to move on from it."

The French authorities say the Airbus A310, which set off from the Yemeni capital, should not have been allowed to fly, the AFP news agency reports. Most of the 152 people killed in the crash were French citizens visiting relatives in the Comoros. There was just one survivor - a teenage girl who was rescued from the sea. Many of the passengers were travelling to the Comoros, but had begun their journey in Paris or Marseille on another jet operated by the national airline of Yemen, before boarding flight IY626 in Sanaa. An association of the victims' families, AFVCA, has welcomed the charge. "It's a great relief for the families of the victims who have waited four and a half years," a spokesman for the association told the BBC. "Now the company will finally be forced to face up to its responsibilities." Yemenia has previously said that bad weather - strong winds and high seas - was the more likely cause of the crash. The carrier is not included on the current European Union list of banned airlines. The crash caused anger amongst the Comorian community in France as people complained that the aircraft had been in poor condition. The plane was banned from French airspace after inspectors found numerous faults in 2007, according to the then transport minister, Dominique Bussereau. Several European countries had also found a number of problems when they inspected Yemenia aircraft prior to the crash. Officials from Yemen have previously said the plane had undergone a thorough inspection and conformed to international standards.	France has charged Yemenia Airways with manslaughter over a 2009 crash off the Comoros Islands that killed 152 people, judicial sources say.
The local authority has awarded the sum to Hearthstone Investments, a London property fund which hopes to build 1,000 new homes across the country. The Falkirk Local Government Pension Scheme Fund contribution could pay for up to 300 new homes, including 126 in Falkirk and Clackmannanshire. Social Justice secretary Alex Neil said the fund was "a trailblazer". Hearthstone aims to raise £150m for its Housing Fund For Scotland, including contributions from the country's 11 local government pension schemes. It plans to provide funds to local housing associations to invest directly in social housing, as well as buying affordable homes to be let at a mid-market rent. Edinburgh-based housing association Castle Rock Edinvar will manage the initial building programme for social rent houses. Mr Neil said: "The £30m Falkirk Local Government Pension Scheme fund investment will, I believe, act as a trailblazer and encourage other Scottish local authority pension fund trustees to take the plunge and invest in housing. "For an acceptable risk profile, investment will provide pension funds good, long-term returns for their members and a social investment to help build stronger communities."	Falkirk Council's pension fund has invested £30m in a scheme to build social housing in Scotland.
The court rejected campaigners' claims ministers were acting illegally by not suspending weapon sales to the kingdom, which is fighting a war in Yemen. The UN claims strikes on Houthi rebels caused thousands of civilian deaths. The government said defence exports would continue to be reviewed but the Campaign Against the Arms Trade said an appeal against the ruling was planned. The group had claimed the UK has contravened humanitarian law, and it attacked the refusal of the Secretary of State for International Trade to suspend export licences for the sale or transfer of arms and military equipment. Lord Justice Burnett and Mr Justice Haddon-Cave, sitting in London, said the decision to carry on the arms trade was not unlawful. The judges said "closed material", which had not been made public for national security reasons, "provides valuable additional support for the conclusion that the decisions taken by the secretary of state not to suspend or cancel arms sales to Saudi Arabia were rational". Equipment sold to Saudi Arabia includes Typhoon and Tornado fighter jets, as well as precision-guided bombs. The sales contribute to thousands of engineering jobs in the UK, and have provided billions of pounds of revenue for the British arms trade. Saudi Arabia has been supporting Yemen's internationally-recognised government after a civil war broke out in 2015. Houthi rebels, loyal to deposed president Ali Abdullah Saleh, began an attack in 2014, forcing leader Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee the country for a time. Since then the Saudi kingdom, and eight other mostly Sunni Arab states, have supported an air campaign aimed at restoring Mr Hadi's government. Andrew Smith, of Campaign Against Arms Trade, said: "This is a very disappointing verdict, and we are pursuing an appeal. "If this verdict is upheld then it will be seen as a green light for government to continue arming and supporting brutal dictatorships and human rights abusers like Saudi Arabia that have shown a blatant disregard for international humanitarian law. "Every day we are hearing new and horrifying stories about the humanitarian crisis that has been inflicted on the people of Yemen." Rosa Curling, of law firm Leigh Day, which represented the campaign group, said: "Nothing in the open evidence, presented by the UK government to the court, suggests this risk does not exist in relation to arms to Saudi Arabia. "Indeed, all the evidence we have seen from Yemen suggests the opposite: the risk is very real. You need only look at the devastating reality of the situation there." James Lynch, Amnesty International's head of arms control and human rights, said the ruling was "deeply disappointing". "Irrespective of this ruling, the UK and other governments should end their shameless arms supplies to Saudi Arabia," he said. "They may amount to lucrative trade deals, but the UK risks aiding and abetting these terrible crimes." The government said UK defence exports would continue to be "under careful review" to ensure they meet the standards of the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria. "We welcome this judgment, which underscores the fact that the UK operates one of the most robust export control regimes in the world," a spokesperson said.	UK government arms sales to Saudi Arabia are lawful, the High Court has ruled, after seeing secret evidence.
England's win over South Africa on Sunday secured the Twenty20 series. The game was officially sold out, as were England's two ICC Champions Trophy matches at the SSE Swalec Stadium. The near-15,000 crowd comes as counties bid for the next round of five years' worth of international games. "To have three full houses over 19 days for England matches is something we've very proud of," said Morris. Cardiff hosted England's win over New Zealand and semi-final defeat to Pakistan in the Champions Trophy, along with Sri Lanka versus Pakistan and the less well-attended Bangladesh v New Zealand match. Around 3,000 seats were not occupied for the England v New Zealand match because of poor weather forecasts, while cancelled trains are believed to have contributed to some empty seats for the T20 on Sunday. But a rapid re-allocation of tickets worked well for the England-Pakistan game after fears that India supporters, who bought tickets for both semi-finals, would not turn up. "It's particularly important (to have big crowds) this year, because at the back end of the year we are likely along with other counties to be bidding for our international programme between the years 2020 and 2024," explained Morris. "There's also the new city-based franchise T20 as well, so it's important we can demonstrate we can fill houses and people have a great time when they are here." England's score of 181 in 20 overs against South Africa could also come as a relief, after captain Eoin Morgan criticised the use of a previously-used wicket for the Champions Trophy semi-final, a choice attributed to the International Cricket Council. "I wasn't surprised (with the score), it's a wicket that has played extremely well this year in domestic and international cricket, in recent years we've had some very good marks," said former county captain and England opener Morris. Glamorgan have forecast an operating profit for 2017 on the back of five days of international cricket. But it appears unlikely they will add another overseas player to their squad for the T20 Blast, after signing South African paceman Marchant de Lange on a three-year deal for all forms of cricket.	Glamorgan chief executive Hugh Morris says Cardiff's third sell-out for an England match in June will boost their hopes of attracting further international matches.
The papers, showing drafts of the poems Unluckily for a Death and Into her Lying Down Head, were bought by Swansea University at an auction in New York. They will go on public display at the university's Bay Campus library on International Dylan Thomas Day - 14 May. The drafts include 25 pages in Thomas's minuscule handwriting. Thomas's granddaughter Hannah Ellis said: "It is wonderful that Swansea University are putting so much energy and effort into new ways to study and research Dylan Thomas. "Having these manuscripts in Britain, along with the notebook they acquired in 2014, will help people to see the meticulous craft that my grandfather put into his work, and allow them to understand that he was a significant 20th Century writer." The papers show the poet revising imagery and word choice, and working out rhythmic structures, including diagrams of his tentative rhyme scheme and small drawings where he appears to be visualising his imagery. Jeff Towns, owner of Dylan's Bookstore, said: "These papers reveal intimate and detailed records of the poet's creative process and will be invaluable to future generations of students and academics." The manuscripts will be kept in the university's Richard Burton Archives, which already house the Dylan Thomas notebook. Prof John Spurr, head of the university's College of Arts and Humanities, said: "These manuscripts offer a fascinating insight into the craft of one of our greatest 20th Century poets, and it is fitting that they will be kept in Dylan's home town, and be accessible to scholars and the general public."	Working manuscripts of poems by Dylan Thomas are to go on public show for the first time.
Finney, who earned 76 caps for his country, is considered one of the greatest players England ever produced. "The likes of Bill Shankly and Tommy Docherty idolised him," said former England defender Jimmy Armfield. Docherty, who played with Finney, said: "He was the best player I've ever seen, alongside Lionel Messi." "I watch a lot of Barcelona and when I watch Messi, I close my eyes and can see Tom. I'm serious when I say that Messi is the Tom Finney of today. "Just like Finney, Messi is always getting fouled, but doesn't complain and just gets up and gets on with the game." Finney played in three World Cups between 1950 and 1958, and is joint sixth on England's all-time scoring list with 30 goals, alongside Nat Lofthouse and Alan Shearer. "I was lucky enough to have met him when I was on loan at Preston and he was not just an England great but a true gentleman," said former England captain David Beckham. Away from the international spotlight, Finney's humble nature and reputation as one-club man endeared him to supporters everywhere. Preston born, he spent his entire 14-year career with his home-town club and wore their famous white strip over 400 times. "The two words always went together - Preston and Finney," added BBC Radio 5 live pundit Armfield. "I remember taking the FA team out to the Far East. We were out in Hong Kong and somebody asked me where I lived. I said Blackpool and they asked how do you get to Blackpool? I said, you get a train and change at Preston. As soon as I said Preston, he said 'ah, Tom Finney'. "When he finished playing, he did some reporting for a Sunday newspaper and he used to cover matches. I was playing for England at Cardiff against Wales and I got injured. "I remember [former England manager] Walter Winterbottom asking me, 'how are you going to get home?' I was hobbling and, just at that moment, Tom knocked on the door of the dressing room, came in and asked me if I'd like him to drop me off. "It hit me then. He didn't have to do that but he'd been a player and I'd played against him. No more than that." "Preston has lost its favourite son, a man who gave Prestonians pride in the place they come from. It was as though a little of the esteem and respect in which Finney was held rubbed off on all of them. "My dad always insisted that he knew him. Everyone of his generation did and so I took his words lightly. One day I was walking through the centre of town with my old man when I noticed Finney walking towards us. He looked up as our paths crossed and, with what I am sure to this day was a hint of recognition, looked my dad square in the face and wished him good morning. "Sir Tom, you will be missed." Read Paul Fletcher's tribute Finney scored 187 league goals for North End and was comfortable occupying any position across the forward line. Although team silverware eluded him as he finished as a league runner-up in 1953 and 1958, as well as a losing FA Cup finalist in 1954, he was twice named Football Writers' Player of the Year. "If Tom was injured and couldn't play, Preston would delay naming the team until after 2pm on a Saturday because the gates would halve if he wasn't on the teamsheet," added Docherty, who himself played over 300 times for the club. "If Gareth Bale is worth £100m, then Sir Tom would be worth far in excess of that in today's market. In fact, there is not enough money in football to buy him." To mark his passing, Preston's players wore black armbands and shirts with the name 'Finney' on the back - as well as their respective squad numbers - for their home draw with Leyton Orient on Saturday. "In my time as Preston manager, he used to come in on a Friday morning and he would sit there and spend the whole morning signing autographs and books," said Craig Brown, who managed the club between 2002 and 2004. "I know he cared for his late wife Elsie when she was ill and he diligently wouldn't bring in help - he wanted to do it all himself. This was a man of the utmost calibre and dignity." Howard Kendall, who would later manage Everton, joined Preston as a schoolboy shortly after Finney's retirement in 1960 and recalls guidance offered to him by the club legend. "He was so important to the Preston team that he played despite carrying injuries," said Kendall, who in 1964 became the youngest player to play in a Wembley FA Cup final at the age of 17. "One very important piece of advice he gave me was to never to do the same. He said 'it is not the number of games you play in a season that counts, it is the number of seasons you play'. "Bill Shankly once said that when it came to comparing Sir Tom with Sir Stanley Matthews, he would choose Sir Tom. When 'Shanks' said that, you had to listen." Finney was knighted in 1998 and, according to Armfield, continued to love the game. Sir Bobby Charlton, England's record goalscorer, describes Finney's contribution to English football as "immeasurable", but many former players reflect on his demeanour off the pitch as a defining characteristic. Former England midfielder Rodney Marsh, who played for Fulham, QPR and Manchester City during the 1960s and 70s, said Finney represented a different era. "He came from a time of gentleman footballers where they were always properly dressed, wore a jacket and tie and acted accordingly," he said. "They would go to the games with the fans, and we'll never see the like of that again. "I've always had the highest possible respect and esteem for Tom Finney. It was like being in the company of greatness."	Tributes have been paid to former Preston North End and England winger Tom Finney, following his death at the age of 91.
His left-wing Social Democrat party (PSD) had accused him of failing to carry out necessary economic reforms. The prime minister was involved in a power struggle with party leader Liviu Dragnea, who was barred from office after a conviction for voter fraud. Mr Grindeanu lost the censure motion by 241 votes to 10. The decision by his own party and its liberal ALDE allies to oust him was seen as a first, even for Romania's turbulent politics. For the motion to pass they needed a parliamentary majority of 233 votes. The PSD won elections in December only a year after losing power. Within weeks, protests erupted across the country over a decree seen as weakening anti-corruption measures in one of the European Union's most corrupt member states. In February the EU warned the government in Bucharest against "backtracking" in its efforts against corruption. Although Mr Grindeanu withdrew the decree, the crisis weakened the new government and soured relations between the prime minister and Mr Dragnea. Mr Dragnea criticised his rival's performance in government on Wednesday, accusing him of failing to push through "the most ambitious programme since 1989". Some commentators have argued that his removal was more about relaxing measures aimed at tackling corruption. Mr Dragnea, while being the power behind the left-wing party's throne, cannot take power because he was given a suspended jail term for vote rigging and also faces trial for alleged abuse of office. His first choice as prime minister, Sevil Shhaideh, was turned down by President Klaus Iohannis in December. A new nominee from the ruling coalition will also have to be approved by the president. Far from being the sick man of Europe, Romania's economy is showing the highest growth in the EU, at 5.6% in the year to March 2017. However, its justice system has been under EU scrutiny ever since the country joined in 2007. In its most recent report this year, the EU's executive praised Romania's anti-corruption agency (DNA) but warned that the fight against corruption was under serious threat from political and media attack.	Romanian Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu has been forced from power after only six months by his own party, in a no-confidence vote in parliament.
Most of the main streets are waterlogged, bringing the city to a standstill. Many offices, schools and colleges have been shut due to rains in the past week. The rains have also affected at least 80,000 people in northern parts of neighbouring Sri Lanka. A depression formed in the Bay of Bengal has triggered rains in coastal areas of India's Tamil Nadu state and Sri Lanka. Government officials said around 10,000 people had been evacuated from their homes in Chennai, the Reuters news agency said. The National Disaster Response Force and the army are also helping in ongoing rescue work. The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, J Jayalalitha, has announced a 5bn-rupee ($75m; Â£49m) relief fund for flood-affected areas. "The rain that was meant to be spread out over the monsoon months has poured in just a few days," she said. "No precautionary measures would have managed to prevent water logging and damages. In areas where flooding and damage have been caused, relief, rescue and repair works are being taken up on a war footing," she added. Images from Chennai show the difficulties people have been facing to access essential services.	More than 70 people have been killed as incessant rains continue to batter the southern Indian city of Chennai, media reports say.
Sabah Saleem, 11, and three-year-old Rayhan were hit by a car driven by 37-year-old Mohammed Khalil Anwar on Brudenell Road in August 2012. Leeds Crown Court heard that Anwar, of Brudenell Mount, failed to stop as he feared being attacked by local people. Anwar is due to be sentenced on 29 November. Sabah and Rayhan, who were 10 and two at the time of the incident, were knocked down by Anwar's Vauxhall Astra car on 18 August last year. They were returning from a greengrocer's shop with food for the family's Eid celebrations which were due to take place the following day. Both underwent surgery at Leeds General Infirmary. While Rayhan was discharged from hospital a few days later, Sabah remained in hospital for about six months and surgeons operated on her several times. The court was told she had been left with "significant and permanent" disabilities as a result of the crash. During his trial, Anwar told the court he was in control of his car at the time of the collision, but he had no time to react when Sabah and Rayhan ran out in front of him. The court heard Anwar was driving at nearly 35 mph along Brudenell Road when he collided with the two children, about 15 mph faster than the speed limit. Anwar admitted he did not know the speed limit was 20 mph along that stretch of road, even though he had regularly driven along there over the past 12 years. He told the court he drove off after hitting the children as he was afraid he would be attacked. Following the verdict, Sabah said she still could not remember anything about the accident. While she still found it "very difficult" to walk, she was now feeling "okay", she said. Sabah's father, Saleem Rafique, said his "very brave" daughter was still recovering. The 11-year-old continues to suffer from double vision, balance problems and memory loss, he said. "She was a really bright kid, doing really well at school and very determined to succeed. "Unfortunately, this happened and that has put her back. "She's tough, she's a real fighter but we don't know whether she will be the same as she was before. It's very hard to tell."	A driver has been convicted of a hit-and-run crash in Leeds which left a girl permanently disabled and her brother seriously injured.
The Coniston workings are sited in the south west of the Lake District National Park, below Coniston Old Man and Penny Rigg Mill. Lake District Park adviser, Eleanor Kingston, said volunteers were needed to help with conservation and archaeological survey work. It would give people the chance to "connect with their heritage" she said. Copper was mined at the scheduled monument until the 1950s. Over the next two years more than 150 repairs will be made and work carried out to stabilise structures. Chalcopyrite, a copper iron sulphide often known as Fool's Gold, was used for 16th century weapons, coins and the hulls of ships. German workers were brought to Coniston by Queen Elizabeth I to extract it. At its peak in the 19th century the mine employed 600 people.	A £450,000 Heritage Lottery grant has helped secure the future of a 400-year-old copper mine in Cumbria.
Gordon Smith, 44, was found dead on Lake Road about 400m (0.2 miles) from his home on Church Street on 1 July. Mark Russell, 27, previously of Holly Terrace, pleaded not guilty to manslaughter at Carlisle Crown Court. He was was given conditional bail ahead of trial on 14 March. It is expected to last up to five days. Judge Paul Batty QC said one of the conditions is that he does not enter Windermere or Bowness-on-Windermere. A 31-year-old man from Millom, a woman aged 48 and a 15-year-old girl, both from Kent, previously arrested on suspicion of murder, have been released with no further action, Cumbria Police said.	A man has denied the manslaughter of another man who was found lying in a street in Windermere close to where he lived.
The 29-year-old forward has signed what the Red Devils describe as a "long-term contract" at the AJ Bell Stadium. McCarthy has previously played in Super League with Hull KR and Warrington, helping Wolves win the Challenge Cup. "Tyrone is a really big signing for us. He is a bloke that leads with his actions," said head coach Ian Watson. "Not only will he bring ability and experience to the side, but also leadership. "His attitude and commitment to play for his team-mates is first class and that is exactly what we need at this stage of the season." McCarthy, who has 12 international caps and played for his country at the 2013 World Cup, will be available for the Super 8s phase of the season, with Salford sitting third in Super League with one round of the regular season remaining.	Salford have signed Ireland international Tyrone McCarthy from Australian NRL side St George Illawarra Dragons with immediate effect.
Pundits and election wags love to talk about the so-called "October surprise" - a last-minute revelation that turns an election upside down. This October, the only surprise seems to be a day without surprises. Here are just some of the highlights of a week that will likely cast a shadow over US politics for years to come. If there were any doubts about the direction the second US presidential debate was going to take on Sunday night, they were dispelled an hour before showtime, when Donald Trump held an impromptu press conference with women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault. The striking thing is that while the former president's sexual history was broached by the Republican, it probably wasn't the most eye-popping, norm-breaking moment of the debate. That, instead, came when Mr Trump said that Hillary Clinton feared his presidency because his election would lead to her imprisonment. "Such incendiary talk is an affront to elementary democratic decency and a breach of the boundaries of American political discourse," writes conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer. In the days since the debate, Mr Trump has only increased the voltage. Where once he used to downplay his crowd's "lock her up" chants, now he eggs them on. "She has to go to jail," he said at a Pennsylvania rally. Gone is any semblance of moderation or talk of pivot and restraint. It's red meat from here on out. Parade of the accusers While Mr Trump's embrace of "lock her up" rhetoric received the lion's share of condemnation from the left and the right, that debate moment likely won't have the greatest impact on the final month of the campaign. That (dubious) honour goes to his assertion that his secretly recorded discussion of how he made unwelcome advances on women was "just talk". Such a blanket denial has prompted a steady stream of women to come forward to assert that Mr Trump's actions do, in fact, reflect his candid words. Jessica Leeds, who accused Mr Trump of fondling her on a plane, said she practically jumped out of her skin when she heard Mr Trump deny any improper behaviour. The Trump campaign has promised that it will release evidence that the accusers are fabricating their claims - and Mr Trump in several speeches has issued blanket denials. So far, however, the sum total of evidence levelled against the growing list of women coming forward is a discussion of the mobility of airline armrests, an insistence that Mr Trump wouldn't have enough private time with the women in question to do anything untoward and, most amazingly, Mr Trump's own assertion that one of the women wasn't attractive enough to catch his eye. "Believe me, she would not be my first choice," he said at a North Carolina rally on Friday. Believe me, that line isn't going to win him any votes. You'd be hard-pressed to notice over the din of the travelling circus the Trump campaign has become, but the Clinton team also spent the week weathering a scandal of its own. Thanks to the release by Wikileaks of emails possibly acquired by Russian hackers, the public has been given an inside view of the Clinton campaign - and the picture it paints is often unflattering. Campaign operatives obsess over messaging and even individual tweets, they mull over negative campaign tactics, try to resolve staff infighting and speculate on ways to inspire a liberal revolt within the Catholic Church. The emails - assuming they are authentic - contain a full opposition-research dossier on primary opponent Bernie Sanders and staff-culled highlights of the most controversial portions of Mrs Clinton's speech to Wall Street banks that feature her pining for a hemispheric free-trade, open-borders zone. They also show the campaign's at-times cosy relationship with mainstream journalists and television pundits - including evidence that former Democratic campaign operative (and current party head) Donna Brazile may have given the Clinton team a sneak peek at a question from a televised town hall forum during the Democratic primary. It turns out presidential campaigns, like sausage, aren't things anyone wants to watch being made. Let's face it, email controversies aside, right now it's just Donald Trump's world and we're all living in it. Unfortunately for the Republican nominee, that particular world is one with enemies around every corner, conspiring to seize what is rightfully his. After announcing that he was free of "shackles" in a tweet on Tuesday morning, Mr Trump has proceeded to pick fights with members of his own party's leadership, condemn what he sees as a hopelessly biased media and warn of an international cabal that aims to subvert American democracy. He regularly tells his supporters that they should carefully monitor polling places in "other communities" for signs of malfeasance. His own website currently has a sign-up for volunteer "election observers". "This election will determine whether we are a free nation or whether we have only the illusion of democracy, but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system, and our system is rigged," Mr Trump said at a rally in Florida on Thursday. His campaign, he said, was at war with "a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities". Mr Trump's latest remarks have some commentators saying he's moved from anti-Semitic dog whistles to a fully fledged bullhorn. "Whatever Trump is thinking or means, the white nationalists and neo-Nazis he's activated will hear his speech with glee because he's channeling textbook anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, with all the code words and emotional tenor," writes liberal blogger Josh Marshall. "These are the kinds of conspiratorial, revanchist fantasies that spur violence and attacks on the mundane ordinariness of democracy itself." This week also featured two of the Democratic Party's biggest guns unloading their most pointed fusillades. President Barack Obama, who has seen his approval ratings soar to their highest point in nearly four years, appears to be running out of pejoratives to describe the Republican nominee. On Wednesday he said Mr Trump's comments on women would disqualify him from employment at a 7-Eleven convenience store, let alone the presidency. Perhaps more concerning for Republicans up and down the ballot, however, was Mr Obama's decision to try to tie the party as a whole to what could be Mr Trump's sinking electoral ship. "They don't get credit for at the very last minute when, finally, the guy they nominated and supported is caught on tape saying things that no decent person would even think, much less say, much less brag about, much less act on," Mr Obama said in Ohio on Thursday. "You can't wait until that finally happens and then say that's too much and then think somehow you're showing any kind of leadership and deserve to be elected to the United States Senate." Those remarks stand in sharp contrast with the tone Mr Obama took at the Democratic National Convention in July, when he said that Mr Trump didn't embody Republican or conservative values. Meanwhile, First Lady Michelle Obama launched her own attack on Mr Trump - and, if anything, it was more personal and more deadly. She has the advantage of being able to speak to Americans not as a politician but as an ordinary citizen (who happens to live in the White House, of course). And in this case, she was speaking to the nation as an outraged woman. "This is not something we can sweep under the rug as just another disturbing footnote in a sad election," she said of Mr Trump's surreptitiously recorded comments. "This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behaviour." That her speech took place shortly before Mr Trump's free-form conspiracy rant, media condemnation and blanket denial of sexual assault allegations just made the contrast more stark. Rhetoric and media furore aside, what this election really boils down to is a numbers game. Who can marshal financial and manpower resources and who can't? Who's got the votes in key states, and who doesn't? Messaging and momentum matter, but in the end it's only important insofar as it puts ballots in the box and numbers on the board on election day. According to current polling, it's been a miserable week for Donald Trump. His numbers are tanking nationally, as Hillary Clinton has stretched her lead from a virtual dead heat before the first debate to high single digits. The story in swing states is equally troubling for the Republican. He still leads in Iowa, but the pivotal battlegrounds of Ohio, Florida and North Carolina are trending away from him. Then there are states that are normally safe for Republicans - Arizona, Georgia, Utah, Alaska and Indiana - that are showing signs of tightening. A recent poll of Texas, which Republicans have carried in every presidential election since 1976 and hasn't elected a Democrat to state-wide office since 1994, shows Mr Trump only ahead by four points. With less than a month until election day, time is running out for Mr Trump. Next week's presidential debate could be the last  opportunity he has to shake up the race - but if the past two face-offs are any indication, they are more likely to cement Mrs Clinton's lead. Pundits and prognosticators have been wrong about Mr Trump many times in the past. His primary campaign proved to be one long refutation of conventional wisdom. After this at-times-stomach-turning week, however, it's looking more and more like it would take an unprecedented reversal of fortune for the New York businessman to add the White House to his real estate empire.	The second week of October is likely to be remembered as the moment when the 2016 presidential campaign went careening off the rails and spinning into the void.
Esteban Ruiz Santiago is accused of murdering five people at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International airport on Friday. During a 15-minute court appearance on Monday he was told by the judge that he may face the death penalty. Santiago answered the judge's questions in a clear voice. He spoke very little during the hearing and confirmed to the judge that he understood the criminal charges and that he is a US citizen. When asked about his employment, he told the judge that he worked for the Signal 88 security firm in Anchorage, Alaska, for the last few years and that he currently has only $5 to $10 in his bank account. Security was high outside the courtroom, with more than 25 armed police guarding the building. Santiago wore a red jumpsuit and was shackled at the wrists, stomach and legs throughout the hearing. Authorities say they have not ruled out terrorism as a motive, and that they are investigating whether mental illness may have played a role in the attack. In November 2016, Santiago visited an FBI building in Anchorage to tell agents he was hearing voices and believed that US spies were trying to control his mind. According to a criminal complaint, Santiago told investigators that he flew one-way from Alaska to Florida to carry out the attack. Agents say he checked a handgun into his luggage. He retrieved the gun from the baggage carousel, and loaded it in a bathroom before emerging and firing at random, investigators say. Six other people were wounded by gunshots at the airport's baggage claim area. Three dozen suffered minor injuries in the chaos as passengers and airport workers fled.	A 26-year-old Iraq war veteran suspected of opening fire in a crowded Florida airport last week has appeared in court to hear charges against him.
The magnitude-7.3 quake hit at a depth of 10km (six miles) at 01:25 on Saturday (15:25 GMT on Friday) in Kyushu region. At least three people died and hundreds were injured. A village has been evacuated after a dam collapsed, media reports say. A tsunami warning was issued, and lifted some 50 minutes later. Japan is regularly hit by earthquakes but stringent building codes mean that they rarely cause significant damage. This new earthquake in Kyushu was much bigger and hit a wider area than the one that struck Kumamoto on Thursday night, says the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Tokyo. In one town near the coast, the city hall has been so badly damaged there are fears it could collapse. A hospital has been evacuated because it is no longer safe. Thousands of people have fled on to the streets and into parks - where they are huddled under blankets looking dazed and afraid, our correspondent says. But there are numerous reports of people trapped inside buildings, including at least 60 inside an old people's home. Public broadcaster NHK says the dam collapsed in the Nishihara village. Television pictures showed thousands of people filling streets and parks, looking dazed across the region. NHK had warned of sea waves of up to 1m (3ft). Japan's nuclear authority said the Sendai nuclear plant was not damaged. The quake was originally assessed as magnitude 7.1 but revised upwards to 7.3 later. Gavin Hayes, a research geophysicist with the US Geological Survey (USGS) in Colorado, told the BBC that the latest earthquake would hamper the earlier rescue operation that was already under way. He said more damage could be expected as the earthquake had been shallower and the fault-line had been much longer. "The ground surface would have moved in the region of 4-5m. So, you are talking very intense shaking over quite a large area. And that's why we'll probably see a significant impact from this event." The Associated Press news agency said guests at the Ark Hotel near the Kumamoto Castle, which was damaged, woke up and gathered in the lobby for safety. Thursday's magnitude-6.2 quake caused shaking at some places as intense as the huge earthquake that hit the country in 2011, Japan's seismology office said. That quake sparked a huge tsunami and nuclear meltdown at a power plant in Fukushima. Most of those who died in Thursday's quake were in the town of Mashiki where an apartment building collapsed and many houses were damaged. More than 1,000 people were injured. Some 40,000 people had initially fled their homes, with many of those closest to the epicentre spending the night outside, as more than 130 aftershocks had hit the area. Japan is one of the most seismically active areas on Earth, accounting for about 20% of global quakes of magnitude 6.0 or greater. Seismometers are recording some kind of event every five minutes, on average. It is through bitter experience that Japan has learnt the strategies to mitigate damage, injury and death. Not only does it implement some the best building construction practices but it has also established an early warning network. This system relies on the lightning analysis of the developing quake, establishing its location and strength. Alerts are then broadcast that can give people more distant from the epicentre vital seconds' notice. Just 10 seconds is more than sufficient to drop and get under a sturdy table or open the doors of a fire station. The prospect of buildings already damaged in Thursday's quake toppling over in this latest tremor will be a concern.	A more powerful earthquake has rocked the southern Japanese city of Kumamoto in the middle of the night, a day after an earlier tremor killed nine people.
Her path to being the chief strategy officer of internet security firm RSA started when she travelled on her own to the US at 11-years-old. Ms Howe remembers vividly arriving at San Francisco airport on her own. "A tall, lanky, moustached immigration agent spends what feels like an eternity questioning me. I know the stakes are high. I know my family's future depends on me passing this interview" she explained at a Tedx event. Her family had fled Iran shortly before the 1979 revolution. They went to the UK and a few months later put her on a flight to the US as they "calculated that an 11-year-old girl on her own will not be turned away by immigration," she said. Their calculation paid off. The customs officer stamped her Iranian passport and she started her new life. The first thing she had to do was adapt to California - a place she described as "where all-you-can eat buffets and free-thinking rebellion are the norm". She found her safe space in coding. "I was happy in the computer room," she told the BBC. "I was an immigrant, trying to fit in a girls' school and the computer room was a safe place to be." But at 17-years-old she took an entirely different direction. She "fudged" a few details on her CV and applied for a job as a casting assistant for Steven Spielberg. "My 1968 birthday changed to 1966 so I could work legally full-time in that job," she explained. "I remember trying to stay as close to the truth as possible." Ms Howe was in her senior year at school, but was also doing a course at the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA) so just didn't mention the bit about school. She had also been an assistant director in theatre productions and gave that a prominent showing in her CV. She got the job and for around eight months she moonlighted between casting for a TV show and her senior year at high school. The UCLA course gave her more freedom than in normal high school and when she needed to take an exam she told her boss that she had a doctor's appointment. It would be decades before she returned to the world of coding. In that time she went from being an entertainment lawyer to business consultant to angel investor to venture capitalist. Ms Howe was meeting with the cyber security company Endgame to talk about investing in them when she was offered a job by the chief executive. "He said 'raising money is not going to be a problem. What I need is a business partner'." She took the job of chief strategic officer and eventually moved to a bigger cyber security company RSA. She described the path back to the computer room as "circular" and said she had been "distracted" by "bright shiny things" in the entertainment industry. But Ms Howe said she was not alone, as a female, in her interest in technology not turning into a career at first. Over the nine years of investing in tech, she said she had only met a "handful" of female company founders. But Ms Howe urged women to consider working in internet security specifically. She said making the internet safe was a "mission" that "appeals to women". "Solving a problem that makes the world safer, makes our personal lives safer and makes our children online safer," is how she put it. Internet security companies are struggling to fill vacancies and she said the demand for workers was only going to become bigger. The 13-year-old in the computer room now needs many more protections than when she was a teenager.	Niloofar Howe is a rare woman working in internet security.
Defence attaché Capt Oleg Kornienko presented Ushakov medals to the men of the Arctic Convoys. Able seaman Charles Lewis, 91, from Calmore, Hampshire said he was "honoured and delighted". The Foreign Office initially did not allow Russia to honour the veterans as it broke the rules on foreign medals. The Russian embassy said the convoys allowed Russian soldiers to defeat the Germans on the Eastern Front. Mr Lewis said: "I certainly don't see myself as a hero - far from it - and I think all my friends and colleagues, many of whom sadly are no longer with us, would regard us as simply doing our bit for the war effort. "Although I have to say that Churchill's famous quote about the Arctic convoys' missions through the North Sea in winter as being 'the worst journey on earth' did strike a chord  - then and now." •They consisted of vessels which travelled from Britain to northern Russia to resupply the Soviet Union during World War II •Under constant threat of attack by German U-boats and aircraft, the craft also had to deal with severe cold, storms, and ice floes •By May 1945, the Arctic route had claimed 104 merchant and 16 military vessels. Thousands of Allied seamen lost their lives Source: National Maritime Museum Minister-Councillor Alexander Kramarenko from the Russian Embassy said: "It [the ceremony] is done for them because they have been expecting for a very long time to be recognized. "It is done for us as it was important for us. "The arctic convoy was a material expression of our wartime alliance and they provided weapons and ammunition that armed us to defeat the Germans on the Eastern front. "We and Britain were in it together." More than 3,000 men died during the maritime campaign that Winston Churchill was said to have called the "worst journey in the world". The Russian Embassy wrote to survivors in May 2012 that it intended to award them with the Medal of Ushakov as a symbol of the country's gratitude. But the move was blocked by the Foreign Office as its rules stated British soldiers could not receive a foreign medal if the act happened more than five years ago. The British Government created the Arctic Star in 2012 following a long campaign for the convoy veterans to be recognised. But campaigners believed veterans should still be able to receive the Russian accolade. The Foreign Office allowed an "exception to the rules" last year and President Vladimir Putin presented the first medals during his visit to London on 16 June 2013. The Ushakov medal is awarded to sailors who have displayed courage in the course of defending Russia or its interests.	The Russian embassy has honoured 30 World War Two veterans in Southampton for their part in transporting crucial supplies to Russia.
Proposals for the upgraded tennis court at Anmer House would see it moved from its current position to improve views from the hall. The new court, on the Queen's Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, would would be resurfaced with astroturf, says the application. King's Lynn Borough Council will consider the plans at a later date. The application, lodged by the Estate Office at Sandringham, says the "current tennis court needs extensive work to resurface" and it would make sense to "remove all the existing court and start again". It says: "On completion of the new court, the garden will be prepared to reinstate the fencing and re-erect parkland iron fencing." The Royal couple are known to be fans of tennis and have previously been spotted attending games at Wimbledon.	Plans to revamp the tennis court at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's country mansion have been submitted.
A number of men, two of them believed to have been carrying guns, forced their way into the property at Oakfield Drive shortly after 20:00 GMT on Saturday. They demanded money before assaulting a man aged in his 50s. The gang made off with a sum of cash. Alliance East Antrim MLA Stewart Dickson has condemned the attack. "This was a particularly vicious assault, coming as it did in front of a family," he said. "Those behind it must be taken off the streets immediately, as they pose a serious danger to all," he added.	A man has been assaulted while a woman and four children escaped injury during a raid of a house in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, by an armed gang.
Hutchinson is involved in metal design and manufacturing and laser cutting. The jobs will be recruited over the next three years. A further 40 new jobs have been filled in the past nine months at the company. The jobs consist of manufacturing roles, business development and sales and marketing. It is part of a Â£4.1m investment supported by Invest Northern Ireland. The investment includes the expansion of the company's Kilrea site and further investment in laser technology with the addition of two new lasers.	Forty jobs are being created in Kilrea, County Londonderry, and in Antrim town, by manufacturing company the Hutchinson Group.
Australia centre-back Wright, 24, has been with Preston since 2009 and his existing contract expires in 2017. "We'd like to have him tied down, he's been good for us, but the football club has been very good to him as well," Grayson told BBC Radio Lancashire. "I'm sure there'll be some more talks. It's something we'll try and resolve." Wright has made 20 appearances in all competitions so far this season, helping Preston to their current position of 11th in the Championship. Grayson added: "I think Bailey owes the club a lot. But whatever outcome will be, will be. "If he leaves on a free, then so be it, because we've brought in some decent free transfers over the past few years as well who have turned out to be good signings for us. "But while he's here, he'll still be considered to play."	Preston North End manager Simon Grayson says defender Bailey Wright "owes the club a lot" and hopes he will agree a new deal with the Championship club.
Customers are being charged up to £200 for exceeding their time slot by as little as half an hour. A CAS report has criticised poor practice including unclear signage and misleading parking tickets. CAS is concerned about the effect on elderly and disabled Scots. CAS describe the level of complaints in 2012/2013 as "unprecedented", with over 3,653 parking enquires - an increase of 50% on the previous year. There is currently no specific legislation or regulations regarding parking on private land in Scotland. Nor is there a system of appeal, unlike in England and Wales. The CAS report highlights the use of "misleading" private parking tickets using terminology such as "Parking Charge Notice", which many people confuse with statutory "Penalty Charge Notices", issued by police or local authorities. Both are abbreviated to PCN, but only Penalty Charge Notices are fines with legal standing. The report also criticises poor car park signage, which leaves customers unsure of how long they can park and how much they will be charged, and failing to take into account reasonable mitigating circumstances. Scottish local authorities have regulations set upon the amount they can charge for parking infractions - usually a £60 penalty, reduced to £30 if paid on time. The CAS report found that private parking charges range from £40 to £200 with many around £100, which could be considered "excessive". It also noted the fact that disabled drivers have been penalised for small infractions or supposedly failing to display their disabled badge, when in fact they had done so. CAS chief executive Margaret Lynch said that some private parking companies do behave fairly and according to industry guidelines, but criticised those that "don't use proper signage, charge inflated fees and then fail to respond properly to people who appeal." She said: "To the parking companies we say clean up your industry and offer a fair deal to your customers. To the Scottish government we say introduce regulations so that Scottish drivers have the same protections as those in England and Wales. "And to drivers themselves we say make sure you know your rights and that you stand up for them. We will help you do that, and between us we can end this problem and create a fairer system." A spokesman for Scottish government agency Transport Scotland said: "There are clearly concerns about some private parking companies and how they manage off-street parking, including the level of fines applied in some cases. "Disputes over private parking in Scotland can be resolved in the small claims court and we would remind all companies that they have a responsibility to operate within the law. "While legislation already exists to protect road users from over-zealous private car park owners, we look forward to engaging with Citizens Advice Scotland to discuss their report and the important issues raised by it."	Citizens Advice Scotland (CAS) has launched a campaign to highlight the bad practice of some private car park operators after a 50% rise in complaints.
Thailand's Aphibarnrat, twice a winner this year, moved a shot ahead after a 40-foot breaking birdie putt at 14. But Fitzpatrick, 21, who has led since day one as he seeks a first European title, picked up his fourth birdie at 15 to join the Thai at 12 under. England's Luke Donald, now 66th in the world rankings, carded six birdies in nine holes in a 65 and is four adrift. Another former world number one, Lee Westwood, is two shots further back after a 67, with 16 players within five strokes of the lead. Donald, 37, who has not won since November 2013, said: "I've put myself in a good position. I'd love to shoot another round like this and if I did I think that might be good enough." Welshman Bradley Dredge, seeking his first European Tour title since 2006, withdrew shortly before the start of the round because of a viral infection. The 42-year-old, who lost his tour card in 2012 but regained it after finishing 81st on the Race to Dubai last year, had been only two shots off the lead.	Englishman Matthew Fitzpatrick shot a 68 to share the British Masters lead with Kiradech Aphibarnrat at Woburn.
Agnius Naumovas, who was from Lithuania but had been living in the city, was found on Margaret's Avenue at about 20:00 local time on Christmas Day. He was taken to hospital, where his injuries were described as serious. Mr Naumovas, who was 29, died on Thursday evening. A post-mortem examination has been carried out by the Irish state pathologist. A 41-year-old man was arrested in Waterford on Friday morning.	A man in his 40s has been arrested after a man found with head injuries in Waterford city centre on Christmas Day died in hospital.
There will be posters with the slogan "liar, liar" aimed at MPs who U-turned over their pledge to oppose fee increases for universities in England. "We won't let them trade lies for power again," said NUS president Toni Pearce. "The system now is fairer than Labour's fees system," said a Lib Dem spokesman. The coalition government's decision to raise tuition fees in England to a maximum of Â£9,000 provoked a series of sometimes violent student protests. Much of the anger was aimed at the Liberal Democrats, who had targeted the student vote in 2010 with personal pledges to vote against any tuition fee increase. In the current election campaign, the NUS is seeking to mobilise the student vote against MPs who had promised to oppose higher fees but then voted to almost treble them. "I'd like to say directly to Nick Clegg that your apology won't cover any of the Â£40,000 debt that students will graduate with for the first time this summer," said NUS president, Ms Pearce. "They pledged to scrap tuition fees - they lied. We won't let them trade lies for power again. We represent seven million students and are urging every single one across the country to vote against broken pledges." This election issue includes funding for schools, university tuition fees and early years education. Policy guide: Where the parties stand The campaign will involve advertising vans, billboards and newspaper adverts, says the NUS. It is aimed at 28 Liberal Democrats, including leading figures such as Nick Clegg, David Laws and Vince Cable. There are also two Conservative MPs who are accused by the NUS of failing to keep a promise to oppose the fee increase. There were another 21 Liberal Democrat MPs who kept their pledge to vote against the fee increase. The NUS also published a poll of issues that will be important to student voters, which found the biggest concern is cost of living. There have been warnings from students of a lack of recognition for problems in paying for accommodation and living costs and lack of maintenance loans. Labour has promised to cut tuition fees to Â£6,000 per year, while the Conservatives want to lift the cap on undergraduate university places and have called for more value for money for students. Some university leaders have been critical of proposals to cut fees, arguing that higher fees have not deterred poorer students. University applications dipped when fees were increased, but have since recovered to record levels, with more disadvantaged students applying than when fees were lower. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said: "I'm not prime minister, I lead a party of 8% of MPs in the House of Commons, there was no money left... Labour had introduced and whacked up fees before we had come into office. "But I actually think what we did was incredibly impressive for the smaller party in the coalition, all our front page priorities we stuck to - and we will do so again." And a Liberal Democrat spokesman said: "There will be some people who will judge us for one thing we could not do. But many fair minded people will judge us by what we have been able to do: tax cuts for millions of working people; more money for poor children in schools; a record two million apprentices; equal marriage; shared parental leave."	The National Union of Students has launched a "payback time" campaign against MPs who broke their 2010 election promise over tuition fees, including leading Liberal Democrats.
A red Ford Fiesta travelling north at Drumjohn, near Carsphairn, was in collision with a white Asda delivery van heading south at about 10:40 on Friday. The van driver Scott Kennedy, 46, was taken by ambulance to Ayr Hospital where he died a short time later. The Fiesta driver,  50 year old Antony Sztuka, died at the scene. Both men were from Ayrshire. The A713 was re-opened around 18:45 hours. Sgt Billy McEwan, of Police Scotland, said: "We would like to hear from anyone who was in the area of the time of the crash to contact police. "We know from witnesses already spoken to that there was a white flat-bed pickup truck - the size of a transit van - on the road at the time of the crash. "We are very keen to speak to the driver as he or she may have information that could prove vital to the investigation."	Two men have died following a road crash on the A713 in Dumfries and Galloway.
The local development plan is looking at how the area will grow after 2016 and the potential for 14,000 new jobs being created. Consultation is expected to start in December on 100 sites which could be earmarked for development. However, final details will not be decided until Spring 2015. The plan proposes development areas: Developments in the past have involved transforming the maritime quarter, the docklands for the SA1 housing and the lower Swansea valley. But the council admits that regenerating existing sites would not provide for all the city's future needs and it will need "significant additional - primarily greenfield - land for development". As well as "strategic" development sites for more than 500 homes and in some cases up to 1,000 homes, some existing housing areas will be expanded with up to 400 new homes. The city currently has a population of around 240,500 supporting 107,000 jobs. It expects over the next 10 years to be the economic hub and main driver of the new Swansea Bay City Region, which held its first meeting this week. Robert Francis Davies, cabinet member for enterprise, development and regeneration, said: "Swansea is a city which is constantly developing. "We know that the population will increase significantly in the coming years and we need to ensure that this city can develop in the right way, providing adequate space for housing and for economic growth." Councillors will be asked to put the next stage of the Local Development Plan (LDP) out to a month-long consultation.	Residents in Swansea are to be given their say on plans for more than 17,000 new homes across the city.
10 February 2016 Last updated at 14:11 GMT A team at the University of Sussex put heart monitors on horses and showed them pictures of faces to see how they reacted to different emotions. They found that the angry faces made the horses' heart rates speed up quicker than the happy faces. Amy Smith, one of the researchers, explains more.	Horses can tell if people are happy or angry, according to a new experiment.
The 20-year-old has played seven games for the Swans since making his £1.75m move to the Liberty Stadium from League Two Exeter City in January 2015. Grimes made his only Premier League start to date in September, having scored his first Swansea goal in the League Cup a month earlier. His last appearance came in their 3-2 FA Cup exit against League Two Oxford. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.

5 February 2016 Last updated at 15:27 GMT This year the festival features over 200 sculptures including iconic Asian buildings carved out of snow and ice. A  ten metre tall model of a high speed train is also one of the big attractions. Organisers hope over two million people will visit from all over the country, and abroad, to see the sculptures.	A snow and ice festival in Northern Japan saw some pretty impressive sculptures made out of the cold stuff.
Norah Boyle, 85, suffered a head injury as Sabrina Duncan and Benter Ouma put her to bed at The Green Nursing Home in Kings Norton. She died 23 days later. The workers delayed calling 999 and pretended Mrs Boyle knocked her head on the head board. They must do 160 hours' unpaid work and pay Â£500 court costs each. The pair were not prosecuted for being responsible for the fall, but for being "grossly negligent in their response". Mrs Boyle died in hospital after developing pneumonia. In sentencing, judge Mark Wall said it was impossible to say whether reporting the incident any earlier would have made any difference to Mrs Boyle's eventual death. Her daughter, Ellen Boyle, said: "I'm appalled that that's what they got for what happened to my mum. "I'm appalled that my mother's life is only worth 12 months of a community order." Speaking after the court hearing Det Sgt Victoria Lee said the pair had delayed calling an ambulance while they came up with a cover story. "While [Duncan and Ouma] plotted, Mrs Boyle laid in bed with a serious head injury, her head bleeding onto the pillow," she said. "Most of us have relatives who are frail, disabled or vulnerableâ€¦ we expect them to be cared for professionally and compassionately." Duncan, 40, of Shartlands Close, Cotteridge, and Ouma, 31, of Summerfield Crescent, Edgbaston, had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing at Birmingham Crown Court to neglect and ill-treatment.	Two care workers who admitted neglect after a pensioner fell from a hoist at a Birmingham care home have been sentenced to 12-month community orders.
It was the 29-year-old Spaniard's first Grand Tour stage win and Movistar's first at this year's Giro - still led by Jungels, with Geraint Thomas second. Thomas' Team Sky team-mate Mikel Landa's late attack was caught as time gaps in the top 10 stayed the same. Thomas is six seconds behind Jungels, with fellow Briton Adam Yates third. Orica-Scott rider Yates is 10 seconds behind Quick-Step's Jungels, on the same time as favourites Nairo Quintana and Vincenzo Nibali, who also finished safely in the main bunch on Saturday. Landa had built up a lead of 15 seconds on Jungels - a gap that would have seen him climb into the overall lead - before being reeled back by the peloton on the up-and-down finish into Peschici. Sunday's stage takes the riders into the high mountains for the first time since stage four, with a summit finish on the category-one Blockhaus ending a relatively flat 149km from Montenero di Bisaccia. 1.

The A835 Ullapool was closed for several hours because of a landslide at Garve. Police Scotland warned drivers to expect delays as the weather affected a number of roads across the country. Emergency teams are also dealing with landslips on the A83 Rest and Be Thankful in Argyll and Bute and the A85 in Stirlingshire at Crianlarich. The Old Military Road A83 diversion is now being used. The road between Ardnarff and Strathcarron in the Highlands, on the A890 Stromeferry bypass, is likely to be closed for at least 12 hours after a large landslide. A railway line next to the road has not been affected. The Met Office issued an amber warning of rain for the Highlands, as well as yellow warnings covering parts of Perthshire, Fife, Strathclyde and the south west. Drivers were advised to use the A87 as an alternative route between Kyle and Inverness. The Stromeferry bypass in Wester Ross has been badly affected by landslides in the past. One landslip closed the route from 22 December 2011 to 23 April 2012 and cost Highland Council Â£2.8m to deal with. The bypass plays a part in taking traffic around Loch Carron. Highland Council said the bypass was closed at 07:30. A spokeswoman added: "Rain has stopped falling and ground conditions appear to be easing. "Our initial assessment shows the landslip to be relatively small so we hope to have the road cleared and reopened later today. Police and engineers are on site at present. "Trains are currently unaffected." In Edinburgh, Balcarres Street has flooded. People living in neighbouring flats have put up their flood gates to stop the water from entering their homes. Meanwhile, the A82 was closed for a short time earlier on Tuesday between Tarbet and Crianlarich. The section of road has been reopened under temporary traffic lights. The A82 south of Fort William partially reopened on Monday after two landslides blocked the road on Sunday. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency issued flood warnings for large parts of Perthshire and Tayside, Skye, Lochaber, Speyside and Easter Ross. Flood alerts were also in place for Argyll and Bute, Wester Ross and Caithness. In Aberdeen, a vehicle was stuck in floodwater under a footbridge near Stoneywood Road. Firefighters have been pumping flood water from a filling station at Inverness' Inshes Retail Park, while travel on some roads in and around the city have also been affected by surface water. Police warned of "heavy flooding" on both carriageways of the A90 in Dundee, and officers urged caution on the roads in the west, Highlands and north east. Rail services between Gourock, Wemyss Bay and Port Glasgow have been affected by flooding. In southern Scotland, a landslip between New Cumnock and Kirkconnel means trains between between Glasgow and Carlisle will terminate and start from Kilmarnock. Alternative transport is being arranged for Kilmarnock, Dumfries and Carlisle. The bad weather is expected to ease in many areas midway through Tuesday morning. However, the Met Office said that since Saturday the worst-affected parts of the country had seen three-day rainfall totals in excess of 150mm (5.9ins). And BBC Scotland weather presenter Chris Blanchett said 265mm of rain (10.4ins) had fallen in some parts of the Highlands since Friday.

Police later named the woman as Joy Robson, 50, from the Isle of Skye. The boy was taken to hospital but police said his condition was not believed to be life-threatening. The incident happened on the first stage of the Highland Car Club Snowman Rally in Glenurquhart Forest, at Balnain. The rally was abandoned. It had been the opening round of the 2013 Scottish Rally Championship. Officers said one other person had been hurt in the collision but they were not seriously injured and were described as "walking wounded". The injured eight-year-old was taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness. Neither the driver nor the co-driver of the rally car were injured in the incident. In a statement, the Highland Car Club said: "Following an incident on special stage 1 of the Snowman Rally in which an adult spectator was fatally injured the event has been abandoned. "The club extends its sympathies to the families of those involved." The statement said the club would be co-operating fully with Northern Constabulary's investigation. The event attracted 110 competing crews and was due to include five stages.	A woman has died and an eight year-old boy was injured after a rally car left a forest track and hit spectators in the Highlands.
Thomas Bebbington, 22, from Shrewsbury, was last seen entering the river near the Dana Steps at about 19:20 GMT on 10 November. A body was found by a member of the public on private land near Leighton, about 10 miles (16.09km) away from the centre of Shrewsbury, on Monday. Mr Bebbington's family has been informed, West Mercia Police confirmed.	Police searching for a man who went missing last month have found a body on the banks of the River Severn.
Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane both hit centuries as India posted 622-9 declared in their first innings. Sri Lanka were never in the game once they were bowled out for 183 in reply. They managed 386 in their second innings - Dimuth Karunaratne making 141 - but India's spinners sealed victory on the fourth afternoon. Ravindra Jadeja picked up the man-of-the-match award after hitting an unbeaten 70 off 85 balls at number nine before taking 2-84 and 5-152 with the ball. India won the first Test in Galle by 304 runs. The third and final Test gets under way in Pallekele on 12 August. Jadeja will miss that match after he was suspended for a breach of the International Cricket Council's disciplinary code. The all-rounder pleaded guilty to the charge, which related to throwing the ball "in a dangerous manner" towards Karunaratne as he fielded off his own bowling on day three. He lost 50% of his match fee and earned three demerit points, taking him to a total of six in the past two years, leading to a one-game ban.	India completed a series win over Sri Lanka with a crushing victory by an innings and 53 runs in the second Test in Colombo.
The sum, covering January 2013 to October 2014, included money spent on in-house staff, third party companies and advertising agencies. Some residents said this was a "waste of money" and the States would need to "measure its effectiveness". Deputy Heidi Soulsby said when it comes to advertising "we've got to think in a modern way - this is the digital age". Ms Soulsby said currently States accounts do not show what is spent on advertising and promotion. She said the States hoped to produce a set of accounts that were "more meaningful and transparent". The figures, from an access to public information request, showed in-house staff costs came to just over £397,000 for the time period. The cost of third party public relation companies was just over £300,000 with two thirds going to tourism marketing spend and other promotional work. The total cost for advertising was just over £1.1million, which includes legally required adverts. Nearly £800,000 of the advertising cost was for States recruitment and advertising purposes. Guernsey's States chief executive, Paul Whitfield, said £300,000 being spent on third party public relations firms would be subject to a States-wide procurement policy. He said civil service public relations roles could be changed to reduce costs for taxpayers. Adam Riddell, chair of the Chartered Institute of Public Relations Channel Islands, said any organisation needed to justify its spend on public relations activity, and that justification needed to be based on "whether that spend has produced the desired outcomes".	The States of Guernsey spent £1.8m on PR and advertising over 22 months, figures released to the BBC show.
Gurpal Virdi, 56, of Hounslow, west London, was acquitted by the jury at Southwark Crown Court. Mr Virdi had denied indecently assaulting a male prisoner and misconduct in public office. The charges dated back to on or before 7 November 1986. During the trial Mr Virdi accused the Metropolitan Police of bringing the criminal case against him as part of a 17-year campaign to "hound" him out of the force. The retired detective claimed the police had tried to discredit him after he gave evidence to the Stephen Lawrence inquiry about racism within the police force. He told jurors: "This is a typical reaction from a department that has hounded me since 1998, investigating me and following me around and bugging my phone. Mr Virdi retired from the Metropolitan Police in 2012 after 30 years of service.	A former Metropolitan Police officer has been found not guilty of sexually assaulting a teenage boy in the back of a police van nearly 30 years ago.
It was far from a comfortable afternoon for high-flying Rovers against a side that had failed to win in their previous five matches. But Rowe scored in the last seconds of the first half to give Doncaster something to work with after the break. The midfielder latched onto the ball after a fine dummy from John Marquis and clipped a shot over Colchester goalkeeper Sam Walker. The visitors had done a superb job to stifle Doncaster's passing game with high-intensity pressing in midfield. And Colchester arguably had the more dangerous chances. Chris Porter rose unmarked but headed straight at Marko Marosi a matter of seconds before Doncaster took the lead. Marquis really should have doubled the advantage in the second half. Inexplicably left unmarked standing just inside his own half, the striker latched onto a long clearance and attempted to round Walker but saw his shot cleared off the line by Richard Brindley. Colchester piled on the pressure in the latter stages but Doncaster held firm. Report supplied by the Press Association. Match ends, Doncaster Rovers 1, Colchester United 0.

After a sterile first 60 minutes, Stephane Sessegnon fired the Baggies into the lead with a powerful shot. Stoke created little in the second half but substitute Jonathan Walters headed them level from a superb Joselu cross. Almost immediately, the visitors' Geoff Cameron was sent off for striking Claudio Yacob before Evans tapped home after a goalmouth scramble. Relive how West Brom beat Stoke here Stoke had two men sent off within the first 30 minutes in the reverse fixture in August and needless indiscipline proved costly again at The Hawthorns. The red card for Cameron, in reaction to a Yacob challenge, came much later in the game - the 82nd minute - but it followed within 60 seconds of substitute Walters heading an undeserved equaliser. From being in a position where they could have stolen an unlikely three points, Mark Hughes' men were forced back on to the back foot. The Baggies piled on the pressure, won a 93rd-minute corner and, after the ball pin-balled around the six-yard box, centre-half Evans tapped home his first goal for the club as Stoke appealed for offside in vain. Media playback is not supported on this device Former Stoke boss Tony Pulis has now lost only once in 11 matches when managing in this fixture after West Brom won their second game in a row to move further away from the relegation zone. The home team totally dominated the second half, having 11 shots to Stoke's three, and striker Rickie Lambert blew a great opportunity to put them 2-0 up when he miscontrolled after being put clean through. Walters punished them almost immediately, but Evans, who along with captain Darren Fletcher performed superbly throughout, was in the right place as Stoke became the final team this season to concede in the Premier League from a corner. Fletcher, who covered a match-high 11.03km, was key to the opening goal, winning possession and surging forward before finding James Morrison, who set up Sessegnon for his first league strike in over a year. Pulis' men kept 17 league clean sheets in 2015 and, although they could not do so in their first match of 2016, they looked secure at the back for virtually the whole game and climb to 12th, just three points behind Stoke. Stoke named an unchanged team for the third match in succession after wins over Manchester United and Everton but, having scored four at Goodison on Monday, offered little threat at The Hawthorns. Bojan, Marko Arnautovic and Xherdan Shaqiri linked up brilliantly at Everton but Evans and Gareth McAuley virtually nullified them, with the Swiss managing one tame shot in the second half. Walters' goal came from nowhere, created by a rare moment of quality from fellow substitute Joselu, but they are still only four points from fifth-placed Manchester United in 10th and in a good position to climb the table in the second half of the season. Media playback is not supported on this device Stoke boss Mark Hughes: "I don't think it was a high-quality game - we didn't play particularly well and I didn't think West Brom played particularly well. "Geoff got caught late by the lad Yacob, he's just reacted to it and pushed the guy. We're not too happy with the reaction of the West Brom player. I think he went down really easily with the intention of maybe getting Geoff sent off, which he succeeded in doing. "We'll look again tomorrow and we'll decide whether or not we appeal. At the moment, having seen it, that is probably what we will do." West Brom boss Tony Pulis: "Stoke have been flying and are a real high-quality team and we are very pleased to win. "The equaliser would have given them momentum but the lad being sent off means it goes back our way." West Brom host Bristol City in the third round of the FA Cup next Saturdaybefore a league trip to Chelsea on 13 January, while Stoke are at home to Liverpool in the first leg of their League Cup semi-final on Tuesday. After an FA Cup trip to Doncaster on 9 January, their next league game is home to Norwich on 13 January.	Jonny Evans grabbed a stoppage-time winner for West Brom as Stoke suffered just their third defeat in 13 matches.
Fox has spent the last five years as chief commercial officer at Premier League rivals Arsenal and replaces Paul Faulkner, who left Villa Park in July. "I was delighted and even flattered by Tom's interest in the job," said owner Randy Lerner, who put the club up for sale in May but is yet to find a buyer. "His reputation as a leader and team builder makes him, to my mind, a great fit to take our club forward." Fox had been with the Gunners since 2009 and brings more than 25 years' experience of sports marketing to Villa. "Aston Villa has always been an important club in English football and it has a long and rich history of success at the top of the game," Fox said. "The chance to help restore the club to its rightful place in the Premier League is a challenge I'm really energised by and greatly looking forward to."	Aston Villa have named Tom Fox as the club's new chief executive.
An uplifting Six Nations featuring wins over Italy and France ended with a 35-25 defeat by Ireland on Saturday. Two quick Irish tries while the Scots had a man in the sin-bin proved costly. "The top teams in the world simply don't have flat halves like we did. They don't come out and start slowly," Gray told BBC Scotland. "I hope we can achieve that winning habit, and every time we take the field, we start with a bang." Gray's second-half try in Dublin was one of 11 Scotland scored in the tournament, surpassing their previous best Six Nations tally of nine in 2000. Their 25 points in defeat was the most they had managed in Dublin for 32 years, contributing to an overall haul of 122 from their five matches, the first time they had passed three figures in the Six Nations. "I think there's been progress," added, Gray, echoing the sentiments of captain Greig Laidlaw and hooker Stuart McInally. "Certainly, looking at last year's tournament, we didn't manage to win a game and this year we won two and came very close in two. "We finished well and we'll take a lot of positives from the championship. "We've always said that it's a talented group, it's a group that can do things and we're building towards something." Media playback is not supported on this device Stuart Hogg, who scored a stunning solo try in Dublin, and Duncan Taylor, who enjoyed another strong outing after a brilliant individual try against France, have been nominated among 12 players for the Six Nations player of the tournament award. England trio Billy Vunipola, Jonathan Joseph and Jack Nowell, Wales duo George North and Gareth Davies, Ireland's Jonathan Sexton and Conor Murray, France pair Guilhem Guirado and Virimi Vakatawa, and Italy captain Sergio Parisse are the others.	Lock Richie Gray says Scotland can't afford flat periods and must start every game 'with a bang' if they are to develop into a world-class team.
The character with a huge papier mache head was the alter-ego of musician and comedian Chris Sievey, who died in 2010. Fans raised Â£60,000 for the tribute which was made in a Czech foundry. Hundreds of people attended an unveiling ceremony earlier, many in fancy dress for the occasion. Neil Taylor, who helped raise the donations for the statue, said its installation would mean that "Frank will gaze on the Timperley sunset forever". He said: "You either got the humour or you didn't get the humour. "Frank Sidebottom created a whole world, he was just magical. He just made a very modest living entertaining people and that's what he's enjoying doing." Sievey set his character's life in the village, where he lived himself, and, as Frank, hosted tours of the area for fans. He often referenced Timperley in his TV and music work, notably on his 1987 release, The Timperley EP, which featured a version of The Kinks' 1967 song Waterloo Sunset with altered lyrics that referred extensively to the village. He also covered Sex Pistols' Anarchy in the UK, changing its title to Anarchy in Timperley. Although best known for Frank Sidebottom, Sievey also had success in the late 1970s with his punk band The Freshies, who had a hit with I'm In Love With The Girl On The Manchester Virgin Megastore Checkout Desk. His TV fame peaked in the early 1990s with his own series Frank Sidebottom's Fantastic Shed Show. Next year Michael Fassbender will play Frank Sidebottom in Frank, a movie inspired by the character.	A life-size bronze statue of comedy character Frank Sidebottom has been unveiled in his hometown of Timperley in Greater Manchester.
The bird, which is named LM12, arrived on Thursday, the earliest reappearance of a resident bird there in almost 50 years. Its mate LF15 is expected soon at the Scottish Wildlife Trust reserve near Dunkeld, which operates a live webcam of the nest. The pair fledged three chicks in both 2015 and 2016. Charlotte Fleming, Perthshire ranger for the Scottish Wildlife Trust said: "One of our eagle eyed volunteers spotted LM12 just after 17:00. "He spent several hours in the nearby trees but didn't touch down on the nest until early this morning when he appeared carrying his breakfast. "From the views we've had of his distinctive chest pattern and long wing tips we are as sure as we can be that it is LM12. "He has also made himself well and truly at home, bringing in sticks and preparing the nest, which is further proof that he is the resident male."	A male osprey has returned to its nest at the Loch of the Lowes reserve after its migration from West Africa.
Speaking to Huw Edwards on The Wales Report, Andrew RT Davies defended his party from criticism that it simply opposes Labour policies rather than putting forward its own programme for government. "At every juncture we bring forward an alternative, we don't just criticise," he said. "There is a clear agenda for what the Welsh Conservatives stand for, and it's action. "It's action to improve the economy, it's action to improve public services in Wales and it's action to strengthen communities the length and breadth of Wales." Asked about his priority if the Tories won power after the assembly election in May, Mr Davies said: "The first spending commitment is protecting the NHS budget for the lifetime of this parliament, or the assembly's term, the five years. "I would suggest that the outcomes in Wales regrettably aren't as good as we want them to be. "And we want to make sure those outcomes are improved. "That's why we've called for an independent Keogh-style enquiry into the NHS here in Wales so we can make those improvements, not on political whims, but led by clinicians themselves telling us what we need to be doing to improve the health service here in Wales." Prof Sir Bruce Keogh investigated 14 NHS trusts in England for a review into higher-than-expected hospital death rates, published in 2013. Speaking about the Wales Bill on further devolution, the Welsh Conservative leader praised Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb's handling of the legislation, put on hold on Monday after MPs called for a re-think. It followed claims that the draft bill was confusing, and would leave Welsh ministers with fewer powers rather than more. Mr Davies said: "The secretary of state deserves huge credit; for instead of ploughing on with this bill, actually saying 'I've listened to what people have said to me'. "Actually, the Welsh Labour government could learn a lot from this legislative process." First Minister Carwyn Jones had called Monday's announcement on the Wales Bill an "avoidable delay to clear up an avoidable mess".	Labour has been "ploughing on as if they have a divine right to rule" in Wales, the Welsh Conservative leader has said.
The scandal, known as "uranium-gate", resulted from a 2011 transaction between French nuclear giant Areva and companies both in Niger and abroad. There is also a French investigation into some of Areva's business dealings, with aspects related to this deal. Areva has not commented on the legal case in Niger, but says it is cooperating in the French enquiry. Niger is one of the biggest uranium producers in the world and the metal is the country's largest export. Many people turned up on Friday morning outside the court in the capital, Niamey, as representatives of civil society movements arrived to register the court action, the BBC's Himadou Hamadou said. Their complaint alleges embezzlement of public funds, money laundering, forgery and conspiracy to defraud. The legal action centres on the allegation that Areva in 2011 bought a stock of uranium from Niger at a discounted price. Niger has two significant uranium mines that provides 7.5% of the world mining output from Africa's highest-grade uranium ores, according to the World Nuclear Association, the international organisation that represents the global nuclear industry. Niger's first commercial uranium mine began operating in 1971, with a strong government support for expanding uranium mining.	Activists in Niger have started legal action into a uranium deal in which the country is said to have lost $3.25m.
The Conservatives have been given a huge confidence boost and will feel in a position to challenge in more constituencies next year, rather than just on the list. At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a "short sharp" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign. The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile. He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people "did not see the strengths" of its arguments. The Welsh Liberal Democrats are still licking their wounds but in a "je ne regrette rien" moment, the leader Kirsty Williams said she had no regrets over the coalition. She has admitted the party failed to communicate what they were standing for. It will now hold a series of meetings across Wales as it tries to rally members for an election that it'll be able to fight unshackled of being in coalition government which was clearly a burden to many of them.	Another election is probably the last thing the public want to hear about after what we've just gone through but that's exactly what the parties at the assembly are gearing up for next year.
Craig Stillwell and Carla Andrews's baby girl Effie was taken away from them for almost eight months. It has emerged she has a rare medical condition, known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV (EDS), which causes "easy bruising". The case has been stopped and Effie is home with her parents in Aylesbury. Mr Stillwell was arrested at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, accused of causing grievous bodily harm after Effie collapsed last August, aged five months. "The hospital treated us like monsters," he said. "It was heartbreaking." LIVE: For more Buckinghamshire stories Effie was put in foster care and her parents were permitted to see her just three times a week for 90 minutes at a contact centre. Buckinghamshire County Council took the case to the family court, seeking to put the little girl into local authority care. Miss Andrews researched what could have caused bleeding on her daughter's brain and tests revealed she suffered from EDS IV. The condition is characterised by "thin and translucent skin, easy bruising, vascular and arterial rupture". The council's application was withdrawn last week and the judge Karen Venables said the family had experienced "unimaginable horror". Miss Andrews said it was "amazing" to have her daughter back home. The couple, both 23, said they were not going to take any action against the authorities but wanted to raised awareness of the condition. Miss Andrews said: "I feel bitter towards the hospital. I know they have to do their job but they should've gone about it differently." Mr Stillwell added: "We want to get the awareness out there that these connected tissue disorders do exist. "They may be invisible but they can cause a lot of damage and they do mimic child abuse and shaken baby syndromes."	A couple accused of hurting their daughter in a suspected shaken baby case said they had been treated like "monsters".
The veteran broadcaster died of cancer on Sunday at the age of 77. The books, in Sir Terry's birthplace of Limerick, will allow people to mark the passing of "a true son of Limerick", the city's mayor Liam Galvin said. Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: "He was the absolute governor." A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London. In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners. At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: "He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years. "All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident. "And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes. "Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something." Evans described Sir Terry as his "radio dad" and said that Radio 2 was "in disbelief and shock". "He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio," added Evans. "He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that." BBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry "one of the greatest broadcasters of our age". "Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish," he said. "You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one. "But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them." Prime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a "wonderful human being". "I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour," he said. Veteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was "stunned" at the news and that his condolences were "very much with Helen and the family". Sir Terry died surrounded by his family "after a short but brave battle with cancer", a statement released by his family said. He leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy. An online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning. The city's mayor said: "Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots. "The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family." President of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was "always proud of his origins in Limerick", and returned frequently to his native country. Family friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was "shocked" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had "put it out that he had a bad back". The Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin. "I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money. "For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan," he added. Sir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon. Blessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance. He also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event. From 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan. The second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or "Terry's Old Geezers and Gals". Tributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday. BBC director general Lord Hall said: "He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family." Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was "one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard". Sir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career. Radio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a "radio genius", saying: "The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone." Sir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account. The singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: "Such a special and funny man. "A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter." Members of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity. Norman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: "He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster. "He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it." Sir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later. When he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: "The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you. "When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine." Sir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015. The One Show: A Tribute to Sir Terry will be broadcast at 19:00 GMT on Monday 1 February.	Books of condolence have opened for Sir Terry Wogan, as his breakfast show successor Chris Evans paid tribute on air to "radio's Eric Morecambe".
The announcement was made on Friday by Alex Jones and Chris Evans on BBC One's The One Show. Denise White from Eglinton village is the founder of Something Special, a musical and creative arts group that educates almost 100 students with learning disabilities. In a tribute video, her students described her as an "inspiration". "Denise has helped my confidence, she's got us out singing," said Sorcha Friel. "There are some students in here that have nothing else, coming in here makes their week, without Something Special they would have nothing to do." Ms White is one five recipients of BBC Music Day's Unsung Hero award. "I could see that music worked some kind of magic with young people and that it could really change things for them," she said. The Unsung Hero award was launched as part of this year's BBC Music Day on Friday 5 June. It is a nationwide celebration of music, aiming to bring people together across generations and communities. The day will be reflected across BBC television and radio programmes with numerous events and concerts taking place in towns and cities in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. BBC Music Day events in Northern Ireland include performances from Sir James Galway, Andrea Begley, Villagers, The Priests, The Ulster Orchestra and the Belfast Community Gospel Choir.	A County Londonderry woman who uses music to "transform the lives of people with disabilities" has been honoured with a BBC Unsung Hero award.
The 66-year-old, of Ballybinaby, Hackballscross, County Louth, faces nine tax charges at the Republic of Ireland's Special Criminal Court. Prosecutors claim he had significant dealings in cattle and land and received farming grants but failed to submit tax returns for nine years. Mr Murphy denies the offences. His defence lawyers claim that their client's brother, Patrick Murphy, managed his cattle herd and farming activities. The prosecution at the three-judge, non-jury court was brought after an investigation by the Irish Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB). One of the judges indicated that the verdict may be delivered next Thursday, 17 December, but added it is "by no means certain". Mr Murphy was remanded on continuing bail until 17 December.	The trial of the prominent republican Thomas "Slab" Murphy for alleged tax evasion has heard the court may deliver judgement on the case next week.
Australian Matthews, 25, of Orica-BikeExchange won a sprint finish ahead of Peter Sagan and Edvald Boasson Hagen to claim his first Tour victory. Slovak Sagan took the green points jersey from Briton Mark Cavendish. Defending champion Froome finished in the peloton, nine minutes 39 seconds behind Matthews, on the 197km stage from Escaldes-Engordany to Revel. Britain's Adam Yates, Matthews' 23-year-old team-mate, was in the same group to keep the white jersey for best young rider. 2013 and 2015 winner Froome and his main rivals enjoyed a relatively comfortable day, which started with a big climb but flattened out to suit a breakaway win. The main contenders for the yellow jersey were happy to let a group of 15 riders - none of whom threatened the overall lead - surge ahead. Britain's Steve Cummings, who won stage seven, was part of the breakaway but dropped back as two Orica team-mates helped Matthews earn an emotional win. Matthews said he came close to "giving up" on the Tour de France after breaking four ribs in a crash last year, and missing the 2014 race following an accident. But his win continued Orica's impressive Tour, with Yates second in the general classification standings, 16 seconds behind Froome. While Yates has produced some superb solo performances, Matthews was helped by team-mates Luke Durbridge and Daryl Impey as they neutralised the threat of Tinkoff's world champion Sagan. Durbridge's pace reduced the breakaway to seven riders before he dropped out, with Impey launching several attacks in the last few kilometres. Matthews waited until the final 200m to make his move, overtaking BMC's Greg van Avermaet and Sagan in the last 50m. "To have won a stage after two really bad years in the Tour de France, the emotion is just sinking in," said Matthews, who has also won stages at the Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espana. "I was close to giving up on this race, thinking it was maybe not for me, but today was incredible. "It was never the plan to go in the breakaway. We were hoping for bunch sprint after the last climb but we had strong guys, and whoever is up we give them 110%. Daryl and Luke gave me everything." Sagan overtook Cavendish in the green jersey standings after winning the intermediate sprint and finishing second to Matthews. Cavendish, who has won three stages in this year's race, finished in the peloton and now trails Sagan by 38 points. Sagan has won the green jersey in each of the past four years, and Manxman Cavendish, 31, said before this year's race that he cannot beat the world champion. Cavendish, whose tally of 29 career stage wins is bettered only by Eddy Merckx's 34, could challenge for a 30th on a largely flat stage 11, which takes the riders 162.5km (101 miles) from Carcassonne to Montpellier. 1.

BBC director general Tony Hall set out plans for the next decade, saying the corporation will become an "open BBC for the internet age". A children's iPlayer and a pool of local reporters who will share work with local newspapers are also planned. Yet he said funding cuts would mean the loss or reduction of some services. Lord Hall laid out the plans at the Science Museum on Monday, ahead of the BBC's charter renewal in 2016. Citing the importance of "excellence without arrogance", he said his plans did not signal "an expansionist BBC". He did warn, however, that funding cuts would mean it would "inevitably have to either close or reduce some services", without specifying which areas might be under threat. New initiatives will include an Ideas Service, which Lord Hall said would be an "open online platform" featuring material from galleries, museums and universities as well as the corporation itself. He said: "Our new, open BBC will act as a curator bringing the best from Britain's great cultural institutions and thinkers to everyone. "Britain has some of the greatest cultural forces in the world. We want to join with them, working alongside them, to make Britain the greatest cultural force in the world. "We are extremely ambitious for this new service. "Where Google's mission is to organise the world's information, ours in a smaller way would be to understand it. We will work with anyone who can help us understand this ever more complex world." The government launched a consultation on the BBC's Royal Charter, which sets out the purpose of the BBC and how it will be governed, in July, promising to ask "hard questions" about the corporation's size and ambition. Other BBC plans include: The director general also said he wanted to enable "producers, directors, writers, artists to have the creative freedom to do things they would find it harder to do elsewhere". Quality drama will also be a priority, he said, and the BBC will make "bigger and bolder series" that will be made available on the iPlayer in their entirety. Physicist and BBC presenter Professor Brian Cox also announced a science strand named The New Age of Wonder, which will be part of the Ideas Service and will be created in partnership with organisations like the Royal Institution. "This is not an expansionist BBC" is perhaps the key political line in today's announcements.  This is a response to the accusation that the corporation is "imperial in its ambitions" made by Chancellor George Osborne (along with several newspapers). Partnerships with cultural bodies, sharing news with local newspapers, opening up the iPlayer to third party content - the mood music is all about co-operation rather than competition. The second theme can be seen most clearly in the plans for bigger and bolder drama and giving people the chance to "binge" watch. The BBC is in a global marketplace - Netflix, Amazon, Google, Apple and HBO - the traditional media landscape is being blown apart. The BBC's problem is looking after its core audience and responding to a technological transformation.  It will take money and the BBC has just taken a Â£650m cut.  Those "tough choices" mentioned in the speech is the theme that has not yet been announced. Lord Hall described the recent agreement by the BBC to cover the Â£600m cost of providing free television licences for over-75s as a "tough deal" that would require "some very difficult choices" to be made. He said: "Having already saved 40% of the BBC's revenues in this charter period, we must save close to another 20% over the next five years." Details of how those savings will be made and which services might be under threat will be announced in the coming months, he added. In a charter review proposals document published on Monday, however, the BBC suggests that "some existing services" might no longer be needed in future. "Streaming news may replace rolling news," the document states. "Children may prefer iPlay to scheduled television. The Ideas Service might mean we no longer need BBC Four." Later in the same document, though, the BBC states "it is too early to be specific about the service changes that we will need to make." The BBC's plans for "a network of 100 public service reporters across the country" did not find favour with the Scottish Newspaper Society, who labelled the proposal "a Trojan horse which will undermine long-established publications and destroy local news agencies". "Instead of helping local news publishers, it would make the BBC even more powerful and would further concentrate coverage of news in the hands of the state-funded broadcaster," said its director John McLellan. The News Media Association, which represents national, regional and local news media organisations across the UK, expressed similar concerns, saying the corporation's proposals represented "BBC expansion into local news provision and recruitment of more BBC local journalists through the back door". "The local newspaper sector already employs thousands of journalists and is the only reliable source of independent and trusted local news across the UK," said its vice chairman Ashley Highfield. "There is no deficit which the BBC needs to plug." "Under the guise of being helpful, the BBC would end up replacing independent local news services," Mr McLellan told Radio 4's The World at One earlier, calling the plan "a further expansion of the BBC's encroachment". Yet this accusation was rejected by James Purnell, the BBC's director of strategy, who told the same programme it was "very much not the goal" for the BBC to "take over all local journalism".	The BBC has pledged to work more closely with the UK's arts and science institutions to "make Britain the greatest cultural force in the world".
It was 1993 and Muhammad Ali was in Glasgow signing books with his friend, the photographer, Howard Bingham. We stood in that queue for three hours or more, people of all ages chatting about Ali and what he meant to them. There was an old man there - maybe 80. Twenty-three years later and his face is as clear in the mind's eye as it was then, when we inched our way forwards and listened to his stories. This was no braggadocio. As Ali once said, 'It ain't bragging if you can back it up'. And that Glasgow man could definitely back it up. He spoke about being at Wembley when Clay beat Henry Cooper in 1963, about being at Earls Court when Ali took apart Brian London in 1966, about being in Dublin when Ali did Al 'Blue' Lewis in 1972. He knew it all. He spoke - quietly and not at all boastfully - about attending Ali's fight with Karl Mildenberger in Germany. None of us so-called Ali aficionados in that slowly moving line had ever heard of Karl Mildenberger. So when Ali's people lowered the boom about his death at the weekend, one of the first thoughts was for that wee man in 1993 and what happened when we eventually got to the top of the queue and entered the bookshop, like children heading into Santa's Grotto. Media playback is not supported on this device He did not ask for Ali's autograph or take his picture, he just stood away at the side and watched Ali do his thing. Then he became emotional. And Ali noticed. Ali was exhausted - he should have been out of there hours before but he promised to stay until the last person left - and he did not have the strength to speak, but when he got up to leave he looked over at the old man, smiled as much as his illness would allow and then slowly put his up his fists, as if challenging him to a fight. The old man did the same - and smiled back. It is funny the things you remember, but that one tender and fleeting image is impossible to forget. No words were exchanged, but none were needed. Ali was the most eloquent man in the history of sport, but even when Parkinson's robbed him of his full voice he still moved people with the simplest gestures. Since his death, the eulogies have come thick and fast from all corners of the world and all spheres of society. There was not a nook or cranny on this planet that his legend did not reach. For the best part of half a century he has inspired not just great sports writing but great literature. Hugh McIlvanney, Tom Wolfe, Gay Talese, Norman Mailer, George Plimpton, Pete Hamill, Hunter S Thompson, Mark Kram, David Remnick, Thomas Hauser - all heavyweights in their own game, all with a body of work that will keep Ali's complexity and the epic sweep of his personality alive for eternity. In looking back on his life, you have to look at the whole life, not just the best of it. Hagiography has no place in the Ali story. To accentuate the greatness at the expense of the ugliness would actually diminish what he was. Ali was the most remarkable sportsman in history but he was also, at times, one of the most bigoted, one of the cruellest, one who preached love but delivered hate on to men like Joe Frazier, a man who tried to help Ali at his lowest ebb and got little back apart from racial hatred. Ali became world champion in 1964 when shaking up the world in victory over Sonny Liston. He defended his title against Liston in 1965, the same year he came to Scotland to fight exhibition bouts at the Paisley Ice Rink. Even by then he was in the grip of the Nation of Islam, a frightening mob made up, in part, of ex-cons who preached a doctrine of separation of black and white. The integration of the races was a sin and they used Ali for all he was worth to get their message out there. No better man, no bigger audience. This was one of the many contradictions of Ali. He was, as he said, free to be who he wanted to be, but he was not free at all in that period of his life, he was being manipulated remorselessly; ideologically and financially. The Nation got into Ali's head - and his bank account - to such a degree that he was, by the mid-1960s, espousing the view that any black person who had sexual relations with a white person should be killed. Media playback is not supported on this device He carried on that hateful mantra for years. You look at some of the television interviews he did with Michael Parkinson back then and you get chilled to the bone by Ali's thoughts. He came across as a Ku Klux Klan member in reverse. The complexity of the man was profound. In 1967 - when still world champion - he appeared in front of the US Armed Forces Examining and Entrance Station in Houston. The army wanted to enlist Ali for the war in Vietnam that day. If he had taken a step forward when his name was called out he would have been on the first bus out of Houston bound for Fort Polk, Louisiana and then onwards to Vietnam. Ali never took the step. Everybody knew he was not going to take it. The FBI had his every move under surveillance. They regarded him as a subversive. As soon as Ali conscientiously objected to the draft - 'Man, I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong' - he was aware of what was coming. The backlash was seismic. His title was stripped, his reputation trashed by white America and his life put at risk. He was not allowed to leave the country. Red Smith, one of the most influential sports columnists of the age, took out a literary blow-torch and let Ali have it. "Squealing over the possibility that the military may call him up, Cassius makes himself as sorry a spectacle as those unwashed punks who picket and demonstrate against the war," he wrote. Ali was branded a coward and a phony. David Susskind, the famous American television presenter and political commentator, went on TV with Ali and branded him "a disgrace to his country, his race and what he laughably describes as his profession". Susskind called Ali a "simplistic fool" who ought to be jailed. Time proved Ali right, of course. It cost him almost four years of his career and an estimated $10m, but his principled stance became a hallmark of his greatness - or one of them. Ali said that he was prepared to die for what he believed in. Nobody doubted that there were people out there in 1960s America who would have wanted Ali dead. Ali was suspended from boxing on April 28, 1967 and returned with a fight against Jerry Quarry on October 26, 1970. Those around him said then, and they've been saying it ever since, that the three-and-a-half years he lost would have been his peak years. Ali knew it, too. Not that it stopped him marching onwards into boxing history. He now entered the Joe Frazier years - The Fight of the Century at Madison Square Garden in 1971, the Thrilla in Manila in 1975 and, in-between, the Rumble In The Jungle -  the reclaiming of his world title against George Foreman. Ali versus Frazier - the blood feud trilogy - has spawned books and films and every new one that comes out adds another layer to what is surely the greatest rivalry in sporting history. What Ali did to Joe was shameful - and he was remorseful about it until the end. Joe lent Ali money and helped him get his boxing licence back. He went to the White House and asked president Richard Nixon to help Ali out.  Joe did not agree with Ali's stance on Vietnam but he felt it wrong that he was banned because of it. "Not right to take away a man's pick and shovel", was his immortal line. Ali forgot all of that. When he fought Frazier first, in 1971, he belittled him in public. He called him dumb and ignorant and ugly. He called him ape man and the gorilla. Through the force of his oratory, Ali turned black America against Frazier. He said that anybody who supported Frazier was a traitor. "The only people rooting for Joe Frazier," said Ali, "are white people in suits, Alabama sheriffs and members of the Ku Klux Klan. I'm fighting for the little man in the ghetto." Frazier was presented as an Uncle Tom - a grotesque distortion of his life, which was entrenched in the kind of poverty that Ali never knew. Their three fights were savage. "The closest thing to dying," as Ali put it. Frazier was prepared to die, no doubt about it. Right to the end of his own life, in November 2011, Frazier held a grudge against Ali. He used to speak about Ali's Parkinson's and the fact that he could not talk much anymore and he would mock him. He would say that God sent him to fix Ali. "He sent me to get him. I don't think that, I know that." Ali said sorry to Joe many times over the years. He felt guilt and tried to make amends. It never quite worked out with Frazier, not in this world at least. As he got older Ali became all about tolerance and love. All the hard edges softened and then disappeared. He lived out his life as a fighter of another kind, not the Louisville Lip, but a crusader against racism, injustice, crime, illiteracy, poverty. Those things, you sense, were of far greater importance to him than anything he achieved in the ring, from his first professional fight against Tunney Hunsaker at the Freedom Hall in his hometown of Louisville to his last, against Trevor Berbick, 21 years later. "This life is nothing but a fraction of a second compared to eternity," Ali once said. "You give God one good second and God will give you heaven for eternity."	The queue snaked out of the side door of the book shop, 50 yards down the street, 100 yards down one side of an alleyway, 100 yards back up the other side and down the street again.
At its peak more than 40 firefighters tackled the blaze in Albion Terrace, which started at about 08:10 BST. The line, which was closed for safety reasons, was reopened at about 15:15. South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue (SYFR) said crews were expected to be at the scene "damping down" throughout the evening. It is believed the unit was being used to manufacture soft toys from the film Minions. National Rail said trains are now running normally between Sheffield and Doncaster. Kevin Ronan, from SYFR, said: "We're on top of the fire now. We're just in the process of damping down the remains of the incident. "Parts of the building have collapsed already. It's been totally involved and it will probably have to be taken down." He said the cause of the fire is under investigation.	A fire at an industrial unit in Hexthorpe caused disruption to train services between Sheffield and Doncaster for several hours.
The foreign ministry said a Russian jet flew into its airspace on the border with Syria on Friday. Moscow described the claim as "baseless propaganda". Tensions between the two countries have been high since November, when Turkey shot down a Russian jet. Russia has been carrying out air strikes in Syria since September. It has been targeting forces fighting the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, its ally. In a statement, the Turkish foreign ministry said a Russian SU-34 jet crossed into Turkish airspace at 11:46 local time on Friday, ignoring several warnings made in Russian and English. It said the ministry had summoned the Russian ambassador in Ankara to "strongly protest at and condemn" the incident. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned on Saturday that Russia would "have to face consequences if it keeps up such violations". "Such irresponsible steps do not benefit either the Russian Federation, or Russia-Nato relations, or regional and global peace," he told reporters. He said he had asked repeatedly for a meeting with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, without success. Nato - of which Turkey is a member - on Saturday urged Russia "to act responsibility and to fully respect Nato airspace" and "take all necessary measures to ensure that such violations do not happen again". Relations between Russia and Turkey, a vocal opponent of Mr Assad, plummeted after Turkish F-16s shot down a Russian SU-24 on 24 November. Turkey said the plane intruded into its airspace and ignored repeated warnings to leave. Russia insisted the jet had never crossed over from Syrian territory and did not receive any warnings. The two leaders embarked on a war of words and Russia introduced a raft of sanctions designed to damage Turkey's economy. Moscow's ban on the import of Turkish foods, the sale of charter holidays for Russians to Turkey and most construction projects with Turkish firms was expected to cost the Turkish economy at least $10bn.	Turkey has accused Russia of again violating its airspace and warned it would "face consequences" if such infringements continue.
Media playback is not supported on this device The world number one, 30, was scheduled to play an exhibition match at Hurlingham Club in London on Friday. "Sadly I won't be ready to play at the Hurlingham, my hip is still sore and I need to rest it," he said. The Briton is still expected to begin the defence of his Wimbledon title on Monday, but will be short of practice heading into the Championships. Murray has only played one grass-court match this year, suffering a shock first-round defeat by world number 90 Jordan Thompson at Queen's. As defending champion, the Scot is set to open on Centre Court at 13:00 BST on Monday. Russell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent: Aches and pains are nothing new for Murray, or for any professional tennis player, but the timing is inopportune. Murray's last practice session was a light one at the All England Club on Tuesday, and although it is possible he might still have one on Friday, he may need to spend another day on the sidelines. My understanding is that his participation at Wimbledon is not currently in doubt, but his preparation has once again been hindered. This is a season in which injury and illness have caused much frustration.

There will be at least eight guaranteed singles' matches, plus any more which are not completed on Saturday. Tickets must be purchased in advance online, with none available on the day. Full Wimbledon forecast Further details will be released at 13:00 BST on Saturday, added Wimbledon organisers. Play will start on all courts, including Centre and Court One, at 11:30 BST. It will be only the fourth time in Wimbledon's history - after 1991, 1997 and 2004 - there has been play on the middle Sunday. Organisers were forced to close the roof on Centre Court on Friday, while Novak Djokovic - the defending men's champion - was two sets down against world number 28 Sam Querrey on Court One when play was stopped for the day about 20:15 BST. "It was a pretty straightforward decision because we're here on Friday night and have still got second-round matches to be played," said former British number one Tim Henman, who is part of the Wimbledon organising committee. "You have got to avoid sections of the draw getting too far apart and therefore have to hold those matches back. "If we weren't to play on Sunday then we would have the scenario on the women's side where they would have to play third-round matches on Monday, fourth-round matches on Tuesday, quarter-finals on Wednesday and semi-finals on Thursday. And that's if we have good weather. "From the tournament's point of view, our hand was forced. It is a good decision."

More than 100 people are still missing and feared dead after a hillside collapsed on Sunday, following the heaviest rains in the country for decades. Local residents initially used their bare hands to dig into tonnes of mud that engulfed some 30 houses. Seven people have been saved so far. Thousands of people have fled the area. The BBC's Jeremy McDermott in Medellin says many of the bodies being pulled from the mud are those of children who were playing in the streets when the landslide hit. The scar of the collapsed hillside can be seen from miles away, he adds. The landslide hit the La Gabriela district of Bello, Antioquia province, at about 1900 GMT on Sunday. In pictures: Colombia landslide Officials originally feared that 145 people may have been buried. But the mayor of Bello, Oscar Andres Perez, told Colombian radio 123 people had been trapped. He said the hill had become increasingly saturated with water over the past few days and that there had been a "high risk of landslides". Mr Perez said the authorities had warned residents of the danger. Orfanely Madrigal, a Bello resident, told a local radio station she had been aware of the risk: "I foresaw this tragedy. I told my mother this was a high-risk area but nobody believed me." "I've lost half my family - my mother, four brothers, nephews and my 13- and 10-year-old daughters," she said. Several hundred people, including Red Cross rescue workers, soldiers and police, are digging through the deep mud in an effort to find survivors. More than 20 sniffer dogs have also been brought in. However, teams are moving cautiously for fear that heavy machinery will crush homes buried in the mud. Red Cross officials say that 174 people have died as a result of the heavy rains in Colombia, 225 have been injured and 19 are missing, without counting the victims of the Bello landslide. Tens of thousands have been left homeless after most major rivers have burst their banks as a result of the heavy rain. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has announced he is flying to Bello to personally assess the situation there. Mr Santos has said recovering from the torrential rains and the damage they have caused is going to be very expensive, and that he is considering calling a national state of emergency if the rains continue. "Unfortunately, this tragedy has just kept growing," he said. Neighbouring Venezuela is also experiencing heavy flooding. Some 70,000 people have been driven from their homes there. President Hugo Chavez has said his government plans to seize private land to house some of those forced to abandon their homes. The May-November rainy season in Mexico, Central America and the northern part of South America has been severe this year. The extreme weather is attributed to the La Nina climatic phenomenon, which is caused by colder than usual water currents along the Pacific coast.	Rescuers say they have recovered 24 bodies following a landslide near the Colombian city of Medellin.
The latest intake of Tory MPs is far and away the most Eurosceptic in the Conservative Party's history. Almost all of the pro-European "big beasts" of the Thatcher/Major years - men like Chris Patten and Michael Heseltine - are long gone from front-line politics. According to Tim Montgomerie, the assiduous student of backbench opinion who writes for the website Conservative Home, a third of those now on the Conservative benches would like to see a fundamental renegotiation of the UK's relationship with Europe, and another third would like Britain to come out altogether. The estimate of more than a hundred outright "withdrawalists" - Conservatives who essentially believe in the European policy of the UK Independence Party - suggests many Tory MPs are being coy about what they really believe. Only ten Conservative MPs have declared their position publicly, by joining the "Better Off Out" group, which campaigns openly for withdrawal. Today Euroscepticism is the iceberg of Tory politics; only the top is visible, but a large and - for the leadership - possibly dangerous mass lies beneath the water. That impression is reinforced by the fact that two of the MPs I interviewed for BBC Radio 4's Analysis would talk only on condition we concealed their identity. One of them told me that even though his views are, he believes, now "mainstream" in his party, he still sees support for EU withdrawal in Wildean terms as "the love that dare not speak its name". The other complained of a "supine approach" to Europe by the Party's leadership since it came into government. When the Conservatives were in opposition, David Cameron made a "cast-iron guarantee" that, should he be elected Prime Minister, he would hold a referendum on any EU Treaty that emerged, as "no treaty should be ratified without consulting the British people in a referendum". The Lisbon treaty was ratified by all EU states before the 2010 general election, but critics maintain that David Cameron reneged on his promise. "The collateral damage from that broken promise", our un-nameable MP said, "is a bit of a black cloud over the government even now". Could the government ship be heading towards a collision with the Eurosceptic iceberg? There are signs of new currents of opinion on Europe swirling through the left of British politics too. Last year, during the Labour leadership campaign, Ed Balls questioned one of the principles at the heart of the EU and its single market, the free movement of labour. Mr Balls, now shadow chancellor, said he wanted to stop "the practice where people can work in our country and send benefits back to their own countries". That theme has been picked up by Lord Glasman, the driving force behind the Blue Labour movement - which aims to revitalise the party's traditional grassroots support - and an influential adviser to the Labour leader Ed Miliband. Maurice Glasman argues against the current EU rules which, he says, encourage people in poorer member states to leave their families to work overseas, arguing the practice can depress workers' incomes in richer economies. He told Analysis he would be happy to make common cause with Tory Eurosceptics if he concluded it would advance his cause. All these factors suggest that Europe could soon occupy centre stage in British politics once again. And the crisis in the eurozone has offered a golden opportunity to those pushing the government to engage in debate about Europe. Douglas Carswell, Tory backbench MP for Clacton in Essex, and one of the small group of Better Off Out MPs, argues that the eurozone crisis has destroyed the economic case for EU membership: "Far from joining a prosperous trading bloc", he says, "we shackled ourselves to a corpse. We are now actually having to pay to prop up a zombie currency we didn't even join." But Mr Carswell appears to be in a minority - not so much in his views, as in his enthusiasm for making Europe a salient issue at this stage of the current parliament. Tory memories of the bitter divisions of the past over Europe are still raw. There is also a widespread recognition among Eurosceptic Tories that economic recovery, not Europe, must be the government's priority. "So long as Britain is in an economic crisis", says Tim Montgomerie, "every Conservative MP knows that the focus must be on fixing that, and staying in coalition with the Liberal Democrats as a government of national unity."

The meeting's convener, the young MP for Camborne, Redruth and Hayle, and former Cameron aide George Eustice, said the group would be looking for "new thinking" on Europe, not campaigning for a referendum on British withdrawal. One of those who attended the meeting, Clare Perry, a prominent member of the new intake of Tory MPs, described "this in-or-out discussion" as "a bit crude", and said she thinks the choice is between "the status quo or a renegotiation of the relationship". The wildest card of all is what happens in Europe itself. Almost everyone now agrees that fundamental reform of the Eurozone is inevitable - whether the Euro survives as a currency or breaks apart. That in turn is bound to have an impact on Britain's relationship with the Eurozone countries, and may well force changes in the way the wider EU works. Former Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Lamont told Analysis that if the Eurozone countries form a tighter fiscal union, Britain might simply "wave goodbye" altogether. And Mark Seddon, a Labour Party activist who runs the People's Pledge campaign for a referendum on EU membership, believes the sort of changes that are likely to come will force the government to put the matter to the public. It is exhilaratingly uncharted territory, and the choices to be made will probably not become clear until much closer to the next election in 2015. Those MPs who are so nervous about debating Europe now, may find that by the time they are ready to come out, the terms of the debate have changed beyond all recognition.

The 24-year-old tight-head is among the starting XV who are given a chance to redeem themselves after the 29-13 defeat by Scotland. Asked if he was relieved to be retained, the Exeter Chiefs player replied: "Oh yeah. "Obviously you want to keep your place and after a loss everyone was on edge." Francis continued: "It's good we've got a good squad and a good depth especially in my position. "There's Samson [Lee] there's me and there's Rhods [Rhodri Jones] and there's Scott Andrews. "If you don't have a good game there's someone knocking ready to do anything to take your place." Media playback is not supported on this device Wales go into Friday night's match in Cardiff off the back of defeats by Scotland and England. Another defeat will mean it would be Wales' worst championship since 2010 and Francis accepts the players have something to prove at the Principality Stadium. Francis says he has managed to avoid the worst of the criticism aimed at the team in Wales because he plays his club rugby in the south west of England. "It's a bit like a fishbowl isn't it," he said. "When the game doesn't go how you want it's quite hard not to take that personally especially if you look at the press. "I guess I'm lucky in the weeks after the losses I've been back in Exeter. "I didn't have to stay here and I sort of managed to get away from that and focus on something else and then come back into it. "It's not a nation is it? It's a little part of the south west and there's only a few papers that will print anything about the rugby, but here it's all over the news."	Wales prop Tomas Francis admitted he was relieved when coach Rob Howley named an unchanged team for Friday's Six Nations match with Ireland.
Jones, of Colwyn Bay, Conwy, announced last month that he has a severe type of dementia. Fellow Python star Michael Palin paid tribute to his "most wonderful friend" before presenting him with the award. Jones told the crowd to "quieten down" before his son told the crowd it was a "great honour". Accepting the accolade on his father's behalf, a tearful Bill Jones told the audience in Cardiff: "It's a great honour for dad. We're so proud of him... with the struggles we're having at the moment, it's been hard." Earlier in the evening, Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio paid tribute in a video message to Oscar-nominated make-up artist Sian Grigg, who won the Sian Phillips award. It is given to someone who has made a significant contribution to international feature films or network television. Mali Harries took the best actress prize for her performance as Det Insp Mared Rhys in detective series Hinterland/YGwyll, which also won best television drama. Mark Lewis Jones won the best actor award for the film Yr Ymadawiad, which tells story of two young lovers who are saved by a man after crashing their car into a ravine in the remote mountains of Wales. Hinterland/Y Gwyll producer-writer Ed Talfan also won the writer award for the film. Mr Calzaghe, a documentary film about the career of Welsh boxer Joe Calzaghe, won three awards, including special achievement in a feature/television film and best factual director for Vaughan Sivell. Will Millard, won the presenters award for Hunters of the South Seas, which explores the lives of people of the Coral Triangle in the Western Pacific, while Newyddion 9, a BBC Wales production for S4C, won best news coverage for its programme Argyfwng y Mudwyr about the European migrant crisis. Music for Misfits: The Story of Indie, which documents the development of British indie music, won the factual series prize. The award for live outside broadcast went to S4C's Cor Cymru - Y Rownd Derfynol - coverage of the Welsh choir final. Those attending the event, which honours the achievements of Welsh television and film makers, included Gotham star Erin Richards, Torchwood and Victoria actress Eve Miles and comedian Elis James.	Monty Python's Terry Jones has received a standing ovation at the Bafta Cymru awards for his outstanding contribution to television and film.
At the Paris climate summit last December, governments agreed that they would "pursue efforts" to keep warming below this figure. But a new study shows the limit will be breached over land, even if emissions of warming gases ceased immediately. The research has been published in the journal Scientific Reports. Around 180 countries have so far signed the Paris climate agreement in which they pledged not only to limit the global temperature rise since pre-industrial times to "well below" 2C but to do their very best to keep them to 1.5C. The lower target was crucial in gaining the support of small island states and the poorest developing countries. Rallying around the slogan, "1.5 to stay alive," they have argued their very survival is at stake with the rise in sea levels and the increase in storms that this amount of warming would bring. But as recorded temperatures this year have edged above 1C, scientists believe we are already "dancing" with the 1.5 degree target. This new study suggests that it will "almost certainly be surpassed", at least over land, based on the amount of CO2 already in the atmosphere. "Even if we just had a planet where we could prevent greenhouse gases going up any further, there would be an additional warming over land, in many places if not most it would 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels," said lead author Dr Chris Huntingford from the UK's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. The researchers say there are two reasons behind the finding.  The first is the fact that much of the heat created in the Earth's greenhouse is currently subsumed into the oceans. The authors argue that this sea sink will decline as the world cuts emissions of CO2 and other warming gases, putting more heat into the air. This will combine with the second reason, namely that warming rates over land are far higher than those over the oceans. "At the moment the oceans are drawing down a vast amount of heat from the atmosphere," said Dr Huntingford, "but as you stabilise the climate you get to the position where these net fluxes of heat actually become zero, and that would correspond to a higher temperature." Other researchers agree that keeping temperatures at the 1.5 figure is going to be a significant, if not impossible, challenge. "In my opinion we should work for as low a target as possible," said Dr Gavin Schmidt from Nasa, who was not involved with the study. "But we should be prepared for worse." The authors of the latest paper say that it was a good idea to have an "aspirational" 1.5 degree target in the Paris agreement. Emissions are going down they say and the uptake of renewable and green sources of energy is happening more quickly than expected. But if the world is to take the 1.5 target seriously, then a serious discussion needs to be held about the implications of that goal. "I think there needs to be a very thoughtful debate about what's to be gained at these different temperature levels, if approaching the lower levels meant severely damaging the economy," said Dr Huntingford. "Every climate scientist realises that when you write that we have to get emissions down to hit this target that could potentially push the world into a global recession - so we need to be really clear about what's to be gained by aiming for 1.5 that might be extremely difficult for society rather than 2 degrees."

The sign - on the Beeston-bound platform of the Queen's Medical Centre stop - points commuters towards the "Univeristy Of Nottingham". The error could have been there for "seven to eight months", it is estimated. A Nottingham Express Transport (NET) spokesman said they will now be looking to replace the sign next week. People were quick to condemn the "unfortunate error", captured by a BBC journalist. It follows another spelling mishap spotted on a sign last July on the network, which stated "Chillwell Road" rather than Chilwell Road. "Absolute joke - what is happening with the world," Melanie Winskill wrote on BBC Radio Nottingham's Facebook page. Gill Bennett pondered: "Maybe the people responsible didn't go to university." A NET spokesman said it is unsure how long the error has existed at the stop, but added it "could have been there for seven to eight months". "Clearly this is an unfortunate error made during the production of the sign," the spokesman said. "We will be looking to replace it as soon as possible next week now it has been pointed out."	A misspelt sign at a stop on Nottingham's tram network has been branded an "absolute joke".
Two former Welsh secretaries, Lord Peter Hain and Paul Murphy, want to change the law to ensure all candidates are on the Wales electoral register. Lord Hain said being represented by people who live outside the country was "insulting to the people of Wales". UKIP's assembly group leader AM Neil Hamilton - who lives in Wiltshire - was asked to comment. Mr Hamilton was elected on the regional list as AM for Mid and West Wales last May. At the time Mr Hamilton became group leader he said he lived "less than an hour from Cardiff". "For the time being I'm living where I lived for the last 10 years," he said, adding there was a "big logistical problem to solve" about where he based himself. Under current rules there is nothing to stop people living outside of Wales standing as a candidate for the assembly. The proposed amendment says a person may not stand as a candidate unless they are recorded on the Welsh electoral register as "living in Wales". Lord Hain said the current rules were an "anomaly" in the Government of Wales Act 2006 - which he said he was responsible for as Welsh secretary at the time. Lord Hain, who moved from London when he was elected as an MP for Neath, did not criticise Mr Hamilton directly, saying he would not "personalise" the issue. The Assembly's independent Remuneration Board is considering a change in the rules to allow AMs to claim more than Â£8,000 for Cardiff accommodation expenses if they live in England. The board - which sets pay and expenses - will discuss the responses to a consultation at a meeting in November.	A bid has been launched to bar people who live outside of Wales from standing for election to the assembly.
But the study says there is no clear evidence of academic improvement for pupils using tablet devices. The study, commissioned by education technology charity Tablets for Schools, looked at a representative sample of 671 state and independent schools. Many pupils reported that they took an internet-connected device to bed to continue social media conversations. The rapid growth of tablet computers in the classroom was one of the ways in which the study found that young people are immersed in technology at school and home. Tablets are now being used, at least to some extent, in 68% of primary and 69% of secondary schools, according to the study headed by Barbie Clarke of the Family, Kids and Youth research group. But researchers found examples of much more intensive use. In 9% of schools, there was an individual tablet device for every pupil. The highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools. The underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them. Between 2014 and 2016, the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000. But Dr Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results. Researchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment. But Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact. And there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families. Dr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools. "The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away. It will almost seem ridiculous if some of them are not using technology," she said. A separate study from the National Literacy Trust and Pearson, published on Monday, suggested that touch-screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read. It showed children in poorer households were particularly likely to read on touch-screen computers rather than printed books. The study on tablet computers in schools shows how much online technology is part of everyday life for young people. Within a sample of schools where every pupil has a tablet computer, a quarter of secondary pupils described themselves as internet "addicts". About two-thirds took a computer device or smartphone to bed with them, used for social media or watching videos. Findings earlier this year from Ofcom show how tablets have spread quickly within families with children. It showed about 70% of five to 15-year-olds had access to a tablet at home. Simon Mason, head of Honywood Community School in Essex, said it was not possible to say whether results are changed by any individual factor, but he is a strong advocate of tablet computers in schools. Each pupil has an iPad, which remains the property of the school, but pupils can take them home. Using these computers, he says, is about making sure that the school is in "the current century and not the last". The benefits are "difficult to put into league tables", he says. But they create a "sense of empowerment" for young people and create an ethos in which pupils can feel "trusted and valued". Tablets are preferable to laptops, he argues, more portable, the right size, touch-screen and immediately switched on. The head says that the use of technology in school also reflects the reality of how pupils live at home and what they will find at work. "I think it's really important that schools function in the way that the world is," said Mr Mason.	Almost 70% of primary and secondary schools in the UK now use tablet computers, according to research.
That compares with just 300 people in the largest trust area, Belfast. It is thought that the problem in the South Eastern Trust is down to staffing issues in that area. The trust - which covers Newtownards, County Down and Lisburn, said it has been unable to fill two consultant cardiologist posts. There is also the added problem of staff sickness and increase in the number of referrals. The South Eastern Trust serves a population of approximately 345,000 people with a budget of almost Â£500m. The figures also show that 364 people are waiting up to a year for their first urgent consultant-led appointment at the Ulster Hospital, while in every other trust the waiting list for this type of appointment is zero. In a statement, South Eastern Trust said:  "We have recently lost two consultant cardiologists who both required to relocate. "Despite strenuous efforts, we have, so far, been unable to fill these vital posts and, combined with the constant increase in the number of cardiology referrals, this has led to an unfortunate increase in waiting times for appointments. "We are taking every possible measure to address this."	Almost 1,000 people in the South Eastern Health Trust are waiting for an urgent appointment to see a cardiologist, according to a report.
The Mako-type mackerel shark was recovered on Barmouth Beach on Friday. Also known as sharp-nosed mackerel sharks, they are usually found in tropical and temperate seas. An average mako will grow up to 10ft (3m) in length, can swim in excess of 30mph and can weigh up to 300lbs (135kg).	A dead shark has been found washed up on a beach in Gwynedd.
She will play Denker, a lady's maid to Dame Maggie Smith's character, the Dowager Countess of Grantham. Johnston, who has also appeared in Waking the Dead and Coronation Street, joins new stars Richard E Grant and Anna Chancellor, both of whom will play guests of the Granthams at Downton. The hit period drama will return to screens this autumn. Series four of the show, which followed the wealthy Grantham family and their servants, achieved an average of 11.9 million viewers in the UK. The very British drama has also been a huge hit in the US, winning both Emmy Awards and Golden Globes. More than 26 million viewers watched series four on Masterpiece on PBS, making it one of the highest rating shows on American television. Previous high profile guest stars include Shirley Maclaine who played Martha Levinson, Lady Grantham's mother, and Oscar-nominated actor Paul Giamatti who appeared in last year's Christmas special as her "maverick, playboy" son. Series five will also feature 24 star Rade Sherbedgia as a Russian refugee who has fled the revolution after World War 1. Earlier this year, executive producer Gareth Neame promised it would have "all the usual highs and lows, romance, drama and comedy".	The Royle Family actress Sue Johnston is the latest star to join series five of ITV's Downton Abbey in a guest role.
Chiefs, third in the Premiership, had only four players included in squads for this year's Six Nations. That compares to the seven players called up from each of leaders Wasps, second-placed Saracens and fourth-placed Bath's squads. Asked if that was a surprise, Baxter replied: "not particularly". "You've got to understand that although we've finished the end of the season very well and we had guys away on Saxons duty and other internationals, we actually didn't start this season very well," he told BBC Radio Devon. "We weren't performing either as a team or individually at the intensity that you need to to demand an international selection. "I think Luke Cowan-Dickie is getting close now, you can see the level of his performances the last month or so have been fantastic, and I think Henry [Slade] is very close. "But overall if we want to drive our players into the international setups we have to perform at a very high intensity and as individuals they have to perform at a very high intensity."	Exeter head coach Rob Baxter says his side need to perform consistently at a "high intensity" if they are to earn more international recognition.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said the process should begin "immediately". And several EU foreign ministers have urged Britain to start the process soon. But Mr Hammond insisted that "nothing is going to happen at the moment". The timing of the formal notification of intention to leave the EU was in Britain's hands and talks would not start until a new prime minister was chosen to replace David Cameron, he said. Mr Hammond's position was supported by German Chancellor Angela Merkel's chief of staff, who said Britain's politicians should take time to review the consequences of leaving the EU. "Politicians in London should take the time to reconsider the consequences of the Brexit decision - but by that I emphatically do not mean Brexit itself," Peter Altmaier told Reuters news agency. Mrs Merkel said on Saturday that the EU had "no need to be particularly nasty in any way" in the negotiations with Britain, and that deterring other countries from leaving the bloc should not be a priority in the talks. The EU has clarified the way the UK can kick start formal negotiations to exit the bloc following Thursday's referendum. It says Britain can trigger Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which sets a two-year deadline for a deal, by making a formal declaration either in a letter or a speech at a meeting of the European Council, the gathering of ministers from each EU state. UK PM David Cameron has said he will step down by October to allow his successor to conduct the talks. Since Thursday's vote there has been intense speculation about when, and how, the UK might begin formal negotiations. The UK's decision to leave the EU has sent shockwaves across the continent with leaders of Eurosceptic parties in France, the Netherlands and Italy demanding referendums in their own countries. In response, some EU politicians have called for speedy reforms to quell further unrest. French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron suggested a new mission statement should be drafted and put to a referendum of all EU citizens. "We've never had the courage to organise a true European referendum in its real sense," he told a conference. "We would first build this new project with European peoples and then submit this new roadmap, this new project, to a referendum [across the bloc]." The first summit of EU leaders with no British representation will be held on Wednesday, a day after Mr Cameron holds talks with members. Global stock markets and the pound fell heavily on the news of the so-called "Brexit", while credit rating agency Moody's cut the UK's credit rating to "negative". Brexit: What happens now?	Britain will resist pressure from the European Union for a swift start to negotiations on its withdrawal from the bloc, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has indicated.
Jo Deering died in 2011, aged 52,  just months after being sectioned under the Mental Health Act. Under-fire Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust admitted it could have made better decisions about her care. However, Ms Deering's sister, Maureen Rickman, said the trust's findings "deserved to be binned". In December, the BBC revealed that the trust, which provides services to about 45,000 people in Hampshire, Dorset, Wiltshire, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire, had failed to investigate hundreds of unexpected deaths since 2011. Ms Deering, from New Milton, Hampshire, had paranoid schizophrenia and was discharged from hospital two weeks after being sectioned. She was sent home where she was the main carer for her 89-year-old mother, who had dementia. Four months later she took her own life. Her family said the trust should not have allowed her to go home while she was still ill. In its 2012 report, the trust said the medical team based at Waterford House who cared for Ms Deering should "be commended for their ongoing efforts to work with Joanna and her whole family in as an inclusive a way as possible, despite significant complications". Ms Rickman said: "There isn't an investigation here, nothing of the sort. I could have carried out a better investigation myself to be quite frank." She added: "It deserves to be binned - nobody would have known anything from this at all, there is nothing to take away from this other than a load of psycho babble and twaddle." In a statement, Dr Lesley Stevens, medical director at the trust, said the report found its "decision-making process about granting leave, and how we communicated this with Jo and her family, could have been better". "Robust actions to learn from this incident were fully implemented at the time," she added. She said the trust had provided community support to help Ms Deering with her role as a carer. "The way we investigate and learn when things go wrong, has changed substantially," she added.	The family of a woman who killed herself after being discharged from hospital has labelled a report into her death "psycho babble and twaddle".
Ex-French Minister for Health and Sport Roselyne Bachelot said Nadal's seven-month absence in 2012 was "probably due to a positive doping test". Nadal, 29, has denied ever doping and the Spanish Olympic Committee said he had passed "countless doping tests". Real Madrid have defended Nadal from "the attacks made on his person". A club statement said: "Rafa Nadal represents the fundamental values of sport. "His greatness and his incredible achievements have always been based upon a foundation of exemplary conduct, unwavering work, talent and astonishing levels of commitment. "This being the case, our institution considers the attacks made on his person by former minister Roselyne Bachelot to be unjustifiable and unacceptable." Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane added: "I feel bad for Rafa Nadal because he is a gentleman, a person that has shown the values he has and that everyone loves. "He is a professional and I know him a little. I feel bad for what they have said. "He has to leave all this to one side and think that everyone who loves sport, loves Rafa Nadal, whether they be French, Spanish or American." Nadal, who has won 14 Grand Slam titles, was out for seven months from July 2012 with tendinitis and then a stomach virus. The Spaniard was asked on Wednesday about the subject of doping, in the light of Maria Sharapova's admission last week of a failed test. "I am a completely clean guy," said the former world number one. "I have never had the temptation of doing something wrong."	Real Madrid backed "exemplary" club member Rafael Nadal after the tennis star was accused by a former French minister of failing a drugs test.
John Biggadike died when he fell while in the hoist and was impaled on a metal post at Boston Pilgrim Hospital. At Lincoln Crown Court, the prosecution alleged hospital staff were not adequately trained and had wrongly removed a knee support pad. United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust denies breaching health and safety regulations. Mr Biggadike was receiving physiotherapy at the hospital ahead of being discharged in April 2012 when the incident happened. More stories from around Lincolnshire The defence suggest Mr Biggadike's death was not caused by failings in training, but by a failure to act after a previous "serious incident" with a hoist at a hospital in Leicester in 2007. Jurors heard evidence from Sarah Vincent, representing the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Mrs Vincent admitted the Leicester incident was "serious" but conceded the subsequent MHRA investigation was limited to questioning the hoist manufacturer's own investigation and making sure the hospital trust had instructions for using the hoist. United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust denies breach of health and safety regulations by exposing non-employees to risk by failing to train, supervise and monitor its employees in relation to the safe use of the lifting hoist on dates between July 2001 and April 2012. The trial continues.	Instructions for a hoist involved in the death of a hospital patient were not comprehensive, a court has heard.
The 22-year-old man needed hospital treatment after the incident on Bridge Street on New Year's Day. Police Scotland said a 15-year-old boy had been charged. The teenager is expected to appear at Aberdeen Sheriff Court.	A teenager has been charged in connection with an Aberdeen assault which left a man with a fractured jaw.
Mr Jepson, who died in August, began his affiliation with the club in the 1960s and was named president in 2004. The service took place at Headingley Stadium earlier. Rhinos chief executive Gary Hetherington said: "Harry had a wonderful life and touched the lives of so many others." Mr Jepson's love of the sport dated back to the 1920s when he first watched Hunslet at their Parkside Stadium. Leeds players past and present were amongst those to pay tribute to Mr Jepson during the service. Among those who spoke during the ceremony were Jamie Jones-Buchanan and Tony Currie, while former Leeds Rhinos and England captain Kevin Sinfield read Rudyard Kipling's poem 'If'. The service was brought to a close by Lizzie Jones singing the Challenge Cup anthem 'Abide With Me' as the hearse carrying Mr Jepson's coffin left the ground for a family service. Mr Hetherington said: "He knew people who had been involved in the formation of the game in 1895, and his death coincides with the 121st anniversary of the game he loved so much. "He was a Rugby League legend, despite never playing the game and his passing is so sad." A book of remembrance has been opened for fans in the club shop.	A memorial service has taken place to remember the life of Leeds Rhinos president and life-long rugby league fan Harry Jepson OBE, who died aged 96.
Media playback is not supported on this device Tweddle's score of 15.916 took bronze in her uneven bars final after a decade pursuing an elusive Olympic medal. The 27-year-old has four world titles and is the most decorated GB gymnast in history. A step back on landing may have cost her higher honours. Russia's Aliya Mustafina won the gold medal ahead of Beijing 2008 champion He Kexin of China. Mustafina scored a massive 16.133 to win the title, a mark Tweddle had herself posted in qualifying at London 2012. "Everyone kept saying to me, 'You're a great champ, it doesn't matter what happens today.' I kept trying to tell myself that but I knew if I walked out of here without a medal, I'd have been really disappointed," Tweddle told BBC Sport. "I knew the crowd would be good and I got a lot of texts this morning from people saying they were behind me and rooting for me, and that calmed me down. "I know I've done the years of hard work, my coach has too, and she'd have been as gutted as me if we'd come away with nothing." London 2012 marks Tweddle's final outing at this level. She has endured agony to reach this point, her body breaking down in a sport that usually spits out gymnasts by their early twenties at best. The City of Liverpool gymnast slept with an ice machine strapped to her leg for much of this year to calm the swelling from training, and long ago abandoned two of the four pieces of apparatus in women's gymnastics to preserve her fitness for the bars and floor. "This is definitely my last Olympics," she confirmed. "It was a tremendous routine by Beth. She went for the big dismount, and knew she had to go for maximum difficulty, and her work on the apparatus was superb. To get a medal is a wonderful moment for Beth and British gymnastics." "I'm not totally retiring straight away. It would be too much on my mind and body just to stop. "The federation have said I can keep training a bit, so I can decide what I want to do rather than make drastic decisions." While she did not reach the floor final at her home Games, her bars routine was the best in qualifying and she replicated that scintillating form for nine-tenths of her performance in the final. But two large steps back following her landing were enough to end her challenge for the Olympic title. Asked if she might dwell on that moment, Tweddle said: "Do you know what? I don't care. Coming into London 2012 I had a few different routines. I went with that one; it could have gone totally wrong, and it didn't. "I landed on my feet, I've got a medal around my neck and that's all I'm bothered about." Mustafina, the 2010 all-around world champion, came through a serious knee injury in 2011 to reach London 2012 and was a deserving gold medallist. He scored 15.933 behind her. Watch Tweddle speaking about winning a bronze medal	Great Britain's Beth Tweddle won a medal at last in the final Olympic appearance of her gymnastics career.
Robinson was confronted as the teams left the pitch, and had to be restrained. "This does not reflect well on anyone," said chief executive Erik Samuelson. "Any abusive remark by a volunteer towards an opposition employee is completely unacceptable, and will not be tolerated." Robinson previously spent six years in charge of MK Dons, the club which resulted from Wimbledon FC's relocation from south London to Milton Keynes in September 2003. AFC Wimbledon was formed in 2002 after permission was granted for Wimbledon FC to move, and worked their way up the non-league pyramid before reaching the Football League in 2011. The Addicks boss, 36, told BBC Radio London the comment directed towards him "breaks all boundaries of football". "We were very aware that the presence at the game of Mr Robinson represented a risk, because many of our fans feel he was very disrespectful of our club in his time [at Milton Keynes]," Samuelson added in a statement on the club website. "For that reason we went out of our way to avoid any incidents. We will complete our investigation before reaching a final conclusion." Meanwhile, Wimbledon are also set to investigate a coin-throwing incident from the Charlton supporters' area, which resulted in an assistant referee being hit on the back of the head. Samuelson said the League One club are studying CCTV footage, to identify who committed what he described as a "reckless act".	AFC Wimbledon will investigate an incident between a club volunteer and Charlton boss Karl Robinson at the end of Saturday's 1-1 draw.
2 December 2016 Last updated at 14:06 GMT Asked by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire about a survey that showed many myths about HIV endure in the UK, Sir Elton said he was not surprised considering the DUP's Trevor Clarke said this week he did not know until recently that heterosexual people could contract HIV.	Sir Elton John has criticised comments by a DUP MLA on HIV.
Previously, agents with the FBI and other federal agencies were forbidden from recording interrogations without special dispensation. Critics of the old policy said it risked generating false confessions and other abuses. The change was first reported by the Arizona Republic newspaper. The policy, due to take effect in July, will cover agents at the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and the US Marshals service. Under the new rules, agents may take audio or video recordings but the latter will be "strongly encouraged", the justice department memo authored by Deputy Attorney General James Cole states. Valerie Newman, a lawyer and law professor who served on a Michigan task force on the issue, told the BBC the policy shift brings the US federal government in line with the states, whose police are already required to record interrogations. "Now you have transparency, so it's not one person's word against another's," she said. Under the current policy, federal agents conducting an interview take handwritten notes and then produce a report summarising the conversation. Critics have charged that process unfairly works against a defendant in court, especially when the suspect's recollection of the interview differs from that of the agent. "You'll often hear a criminal defendant say, 'I never said that.' But how can you prove that?" Ms Newman said. Former US Attorney for Arizona Paul Charlton said he was fired in a 2006 purge at the justice department in part because he pushed back against the policy of not recording interrogations. "We were losing cases and pleaded cases to a lower offence when we ought have won those cases," because of the policy, he said. Mr Charlton had jurisdiction over violent crimes normally considered in state criminal courts, because of 21 Indian reservations in his district. He said the lack of recorded confessions did "great harm" to his prosecutions, especially in child sex abuse cases. "It was a grossly outdated policy," he said. While the justice department has refused to release its policy on recording of suspect interviews, the New York Times has published a 2006 FBI document stating that jurors might not understand the legally permissible tactics agents use to obtain information - and could find them distasteful. The bureau has also said recording devices might intimidate suspects into silence. Exceptions to the new policy include when the interviewee refuses to be recorded, national security or public safety situations, or when it is not feasible. The policy shift will not apply to interviews conducted outside the US, though the memo notes recording "may be appropriate" in that circumstance.	US federal law enforcement agents have been ordered to record interviews with suspects, in a reversal of a decades-old justice department policy.
Andrew Travers left the authority by "mutual agreement" after the error, officials said. Voters were initially turned away from all 155 polling stations in the borough because their names were missing from the poll list. An independent investigation has been launched, the council said. In a statement issued through the council, Mr Travers said: "I have enjoyed my time at Barnet and I believe the changes we have put in place and the continued programme of growth and transformation will enable the borough to continue to thrive." A council spokesperson said Mr Travers had "made a valuable contribution to the council during his three and half years as chief executive." Deputy chief executive John Hooton will take over temporarily while longer term arrangements are put in place, the council said. On election day, staff at one station said just three of the first 30 voters to show up were on the register. The rest were told to come back later. Barnet Council apologised for the problems and later offered emergency proxy votes to residents who had been affected. But voters in the area questioned how the result could be "fair" when not everyone was able to have their say at the ballot box. A statement released by Mr Travers on Thursday blamed electoral registration lists for the problems. The council's review will conclude by the end of May and the findings will be presented publicly to the General Functions Committee. It will look at the "appropriateness" of arrangements in place for the EU Referendum in June. A spokesman said it was currently in discussions to establish who would lead the investigation.	The chief executive of Barnet Council has left his role after a blunder led to some voters being turned away from polling stations on Thursday.
The issue has been described as the biggest challenge facing police focussed on breaking up organised crime groups. Police Scotland said they made more than 2,100 arrests in relation to organised crime last year. They estimate 220 gangs are currently dealing in drugs, firearms, high-value theft, fraud and human trafficking. Some 122 people arrested in the last 12 months were described by officers as being principal players involved in serious and organised criminal activity. Police Scotland said it had enjoyed "significant successes" in detecting and disrupting criminal networks. Senior officers believe most gangs are still profiting from "traditional" crimes but are using online resources to do deals and avoid detection. Det Ch Supt Gerry McLean, head of the organised crime and counter-terrorism unit, said organised crime is still down to "profit, power and people". But with fierce debate around the use of the Regulations of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) to access communications, officers know there is a balance to be struck when tracking people. Det Ch Supt McLean said: "[Gangs] are taking the additional step or layer of security around their communications because of the success we have had over the last decade or so in communication strategies that show where calls were made and placed. "They want to take themselves away from conventional itemised telecommunications billing and use apps based on their phone. "We've got to be alive to the possibility that they will use any kind of means to communicate, what we are seeing more use of is the use of encrypted devices - telephones with software within them that have been about for a number of years." The officer added: "I think discussions around Ripa and in terms of how law enforcement can secure communications data in the future is something they are alive to and will change their methodology. "Particularly the type of crime groups we are targeting - that top 20% - the ones that have got perhaps the most to lose are always looking at new methods of communications. "We're firmly in the camp of trying to catch criminals but we need to give that reassurance to the community and there is a balance to be struck." A number of high profile cases have concluded this year where the leaders of organised crime groups have been jailed. Stephen Nisbet, who ran a drug business despite being in jail for murder, was sentenced to 12 years as part of an operation that led to 66 people being arrested, including his brother James Nisbet junior. Stephen was jailed for 12 years, while James was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Scotland's first "cuckoo smurfing" case - a complicated international money laundering scheme - was also concluded with Muhammad Hameed, Saleem Shikari and Shahid Aslam jailed for a total of nine years. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said: "There's no place for serious organised crime in Scotland and I'm proud of the efforts of our law enforcement agencies in taking on and taking down these criminals who are exploiting law-abiding communities and businesses. "Today's latest figures show another successful year of operations in dismantling these criminal operations. As we move into 2016, there will be no let-up in our efforts."	Organised criminals are using apps and encrypted messaging to evade them, senior police officers believe.
The justices said they would hear a combined case about marriage bans in four states. But a supreme court ruling on the cases could fully legalise gay marriage in the US. The court previously struck down a US law preventing federal recognition of marriages in states allowing same-sex unions. After that ruling, a wave of decisions in the regional federal appeals courts ended numerous state gay marriage bans. Thirty-six states and the District of Columbia now issue marriage licences to same-sex couples. Fourteen state bans remain. On Friday, the justices said they would take up cases from gay and lesbian plaintiffs in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. In November, a US appeals court overturned rulings striking down marriage bans in those four states, the first appeals court to do so since the Supreme Court's initial gay marriage ruling. The US high court previously declined to intervene in cases that had made it to the appeals court level, effectively allowing marriages to go forward. During two-and-a-half hours of arguments, the justices will consider two related questions - whether the US constitution requires states to issue marriage licences to gay and lesbian couples and whether states must recognise such marriages performed in other states. The case will be argued in April and a decision is expected by late June.	The US Supreme Court will rule this year on whether gay couples have a right to marry across all states.
Seam bowler Chapple, 40, has played for the Red Rose county for more than two decades and led the side throughout Moores's five-year reign. He will be assisted by ex-Lancashire spinner Gary Yates, who was already on the club's coaching staff. Lancashire return to Championship action at Northants on Sunday. He's taught me a lot about the game, about what you see from the sidelines when you're not a player, and in that respect he's inspired me to want to stay in the game Moores left his position as head coach following the Division One fixture with Warwickshire, which ended in a draw on Wednesday. The 51-year-old will now begin his second spell with the national team, having been in charge for nearly two years before his dismissal in January 2009. Speaking prior to Friday's announcement, Chapple told BBC Radio Manchester that working alongside Moores has increased his desire to stay in the game at the end of his playing career. "I rate him very highly as a coach," Chapple said. "The lads are very pleased for him because he's been terrific for us as a coach. We wish him every success. "He's taught me a lot about the game, about what you see from the sidelines when you're not a player, and in that respect he's inspired me to want to stay in the game. "My role will inevitably be bigger because Peter's not here, but at the same time I've been involved in team selection for five years now. "We've got a lot of resources at the club and a lot of highly qualified coaches, and we'll back ourselves to be great until the club tells us anything different."	Captain Glen Chapple will take control of Lancashire for the rest of the 2014 season following the departure of Peter Moores to become England boss.
Four of its high-speed 175 Coradia train units have been taken off routes along the north Wales coast and to Manchester. Work on its 150 class of diesel trains is also under way. Arriva Trains said as a result "some affected peak time services have been busier than usual". The Coradia trains are the fastest in the fleet operating at up to 100mph on the lines from Chester across to Holyhead, and are between 16 and 17-years-old. They pull two and three carriage trains. "We can confirm that four of our 175 units are currently out of use for corrosion repairs, also our 150 fleet is undergoing corrosion repairs," said a spokesperson for the operator. "We will not be sourcing any extra capacity due to the timescales involved and lack of availability and there are no plans to use the loco stock on the weekends. "We regret any inconvenience that this has caused to our customers whilst we carry out this essential maintenance work." The rail company said it hoped all the maintenance work on its trains would be completed by the summer.	Rail operator Arriva Trains Wales has been forced to pull some of its fleet out of service to deal with corrosion problems.
Yorkshire Ambulance Service (YAS) figures show medics spent 32,000 hours waiting at A&E departments in 2015-16 compared with 16,000 in 2014-15. YAS said waiting time "was one of the most significant issues" it faced. A shortage of available hospital beds has been given as one of the problems causing knock-on delays at A&E. Dr David Macklin, Executive Director of Operations at YAS, said handover waiting times were "a system problem" for the NHS, not just in Yorkshire, and said blame could not be attached to individual hospitals. "We have numerous occasions where we have multiple vehicles queued at hospitals," he said. "Emergency departments across Yorkshire are working incredibly hard to manage their demand and that means sometimes ambulances are queuing. "Patients who are not seriously injured may need to wait." Professor Keith Willett from NHS England said the increase in waiting times was "concerning" and added there were "a multitude of reasons" for the rise. "One of the biggest problems is the pressure on the beds in the hospital," he said. "That's because the hospitals are finding it increasingly difficult to move patients and their care back into the community." The figures were supplied after a Freedom of Information request by the BBC. Just five hospitals - one each in East, South and West Yorkshire and two in North Yorkshire - accounted for about 70% of the total waiting time. The handover time is counted only after 15 minutes have elapsed at A&E. The number of hours spent by the YAS to handover patients was about 12,000 In 2013-14 and about 16,000 in 2014-15.

Former Pompey shot stopper Carson brilliantly prevented Michael Smith's powerful header and Michael Doyle's 20-yard pile driver, He then blocked a Conor Chaplin header in stoppage time as the hosts missed out on the opportunity to put more pressure on the top three. Pompey, unchanged for a fourth successive game, looked the more likely to score throughout, Gary Roberts the first to put pressure on the Pools goal as he won the ball on the touchline before dragging wide on the edge of the box. Winger Kyle Bennett was next in the queue to see a sight of Carson's goal, his give-and-go with Smith was excellent but he hooked his finish past the post, and then Gareth Evans and Roberts both had further first-half efforts. Hartlepool had shipped 11 in their last three matches in all competitions and not scored in seven fixtures against Pompey, and hardly threatened on this occasion. Carl Baker twisted and turned himself into a shooting position for the hosts after the break but his chance was deflected over, before substitute Chaplin air kicked at Kal Naismith's cross.

Seventeen-year-old Sylvia Fleming was pregnant when she was murdered in Omagh in 1998 by Stephen Scott. He was sentenced to life, but has been taking part in a pre-release scheme. The prison service said the Victim Information Scheme (PRVIS) gives victims an opportunity to provide and receive information about prisoners. Miss Fleming went missing in April 1998. Her body parts were found under the foundations of a partially-built house eight weeks later. Sentencing Scott in 2000, the judge described him as "thoroughly evil". He said: "The manner in which her body was disposed of after her murder is surely the most gruesome. "I am satisfied that you, Scott, not only deliberately killed this young girl but that you planned that killing and carried it out in circumstances so squalid that they would revolt any right-thinking person." Her sister, Josie Fleming, told BBC Radio Foyle she was contacted by someone who had spotted the killer painting a fence. "Even though we knew the time was coming we are angry and fearful," she said. "They need to let us know when he is due for his official release - it's important for us to know when this evil person will be free to walk the streets." Miss Fleming said she believes Scott is "capable of anything" and should never be freed. "He took her into his flat, he tied her up in a bed and put a blindfold over her eyes and covered her mouth with tape," Ms Fleming said. "He injected her with insulin and when she passed away he put her in the attic and then took her down and put her in the bath to cut her up." "You never can come to terms with what happened, we're learning to live with it but we'll never, ever get over it." In a statement, the prison service said those who register with the Victim Information Scheme will get details about a person convicted of a crime against them. They will receive details about any temporary release a prisoner is granted,  the month and year in which a prisoner is expected to be released, any conditions of the prisoner's release and any breaches of those conditions which result in the prisoner's return to custody. In the case of life-sentence prisoners, the victim can obtain information about the minimum number of years the life prisoner must serve, when the life prisoner is being considered for release and have the opportunity to give views when the prisoner is considered for final release.	The sister of a teenager who was murdered, cut up and buried by her boyfriend says she is afraid after discovering he has been out of prison.
Inspired by fond memories of his childhood caravanning holidays in Southwold, Suffolk, photographer Gareth Iwan Jones turned his attention to this subject, the very British world of Caravanning. "I've always thought of caravanning as a wonderfully eccentric, colourful world of quirky characters and interesting regalia that would make for a great photography project," says Iwan Jones. "It didn't disappoint." Together with his wife, Iwan Jones stayed at more than 30 sites across the UK, from beauty spots to those not so picturesque spots near motorways, covering more than 2,000 miles. "There is a unique union of canopy, awning and torrential rain that one can only experience in caravan and camping parks," he says. "For me, the most endearing caravanning moments came with the worst weather - this is when your neighbours and fellow campers brave the elements to help you find your guy ropes and hammer in your pegs." Iwan Jones found there was a daily routine to the caravanning life and would wander the site looking for good pictures as well as arranging to meet the campers later to take their portrait. "Everyone was so enthusiastic and eager to be in the pictures, not a single person I approached declined to be photographed," he says. "In my experience of photographing people in their environments, this is pretty much unheard of and a real reflection of the culture of caravanning - very open and friendly. "The portraits were all shot with the same camera and lens combination, a Pentax 645 and 55mm lens and the same artificial lighting." "I was deliberately looking to bring continuity to the posed portraits, as I knew the documentary side would be quite loose in its appearance. "I'm always interested in finding the humour in my images, and the world of caravanning made for a great fit. "From a man who takes his budgies caravanning to the varied attempts to bring a bit of glamour to one's caravan, there was plenty for me to photograph." Caravan, A Great British Love Story by Gareth Iwan Jones will be published in early June by Frances Lincoln. You can see more of Gareth Iwan Jones's work on his website. All photographs © Gareth Iwan Jones/Institute	In the UK, the May Day bank holiday offers a chance to take a short break away from the daily grind, and for some people that means hitching up the caravan to the back of the car and heading into the countryside.
The men, aged 26 and 24, were in a house in Melrose Street when three men armed with a knife, hammer and batons forced their way into the property just before midnight on Saturday. After assaulting the men, the gang left with a sum of cash and personal items. They also smashed a number of windows. The men in the house received medical treatment for their injuries. Police have appealed for anyone with information to contact them.	Two men have been assaulted by an armed gang in south Belfast.
The 29-year-old terminated his contract with the O's after the transfer window closed, and cannot join another EFL side until January. "I wouldn't say I'm in a predicament, but I have never been in this position before," Cox told BBC Radio London. "It is not a nice thing for a footballer. I'm not able to do my job." The former Brighton man continued: "I am going to have to sit it out again for four months before I can kick a ball in the League again. "I'll try to make the best of it. It is hard to train on your own and keep yourself motivated but it is something which has got to be done." Cox left Orient on 1 September after turning down a move to League One Northampton Town. Having spent six years with the O's, scoring 59 times in 275 appearances, Cox said he was "an emotional wreck" on his departure from Brisbane Road. "I didn't really want to leave but, circumstances being what they were, I felt like I had no choice," he said. "We had come to our conclusion that we were going to go our separate ways. I can't really elaborate on it for legal reasons. "It is a club I will always love. When I finish playing I want to be a manager and if I can go back there and manage one day that would be great." Cox, who has only just recovered from a long-term knee injury, is aiming to agree a contract with an EFL club which will commence in January before seeking a short-term deal with a non-league side to keep up his match fitness. "I was just getting back in the groove," he said. "If I can get something sorted sooner rather than later League-wise, then great. "Hopefully the clubs I speak to will understand my situation. I'm not too proud to play in lower divisions as I need to play. "Come January, I need to be ready to kick on." Cox has already held initial negotiations with League Two side Crawley Town. "It interests me because they are local to where I am," he said. "It ticks the boxes and I used to play with the captain Jimmy Smith at Orient. The manager [Dermot Drummy] wants attractive attacking football, which is great for me because that is the way I like to play. "By no means is it a done deal. We have had talks and we'll see how that goes." You can hear an interview with Dean Cox on BBC Radio London's Saturday Sport show, which begins at 13:00 BST.	Winger Dean Cox says he will have to remain patient as he searches for a new club after leaving League Two side Leyton Orient by mutual consent.
More than 1,000 people packed into the city's Anglican Cathedral for his funeral on Friday, with a bevy of famous Merseysiders in attendance, including comedian Ken Dodd, model Danielle Lloyd and actress Jennifer Ellison. Howe's flamboyance, lust for life and penchant for self-promotion earned him near celebrity status in the city - what you might call a "Scousehold name". But who was Howe and what was his story? It began almost 50 years ago, when the talented snipper stated his vision of creating "The Harrods of hairdressing". Born in 1944 in the Old Swan area of the city, he became a hairdressing apprentice in Bold Street before using the princely sum of Â£100 to open his first salon on West Derby Road. Howe showed a keen talent from the outset, becoming the youngest-ever Guild master hairdresser at the age of 28. His business grew gradually, and before long he was running Merseyside's largest hairdressing training school. He would later be presented with a "Scouseology" special award for services to Liverpool. Previous winners of the award include Paul McCartney, the late Cilla Black and Liverpool FC stalwart Kenny Dalglish. At home mingling with the rich and famous, Howe loved showbusiness and featured on ITV docu-soap Shampoo and Channel 5's Celebrity Super Spa. Later in life he took to the stage as a pantomime dame, for which theatre producer Jane Joseph said he was "an absolute natural". "He was as much an entertainer as a hairdresser, so it was only natural that he could entertain on stage as well," she said. He also chose to regularly spend his Friday night contributing to BBC Radio Merseyside's late show - an association that lasted nearly 10 years. At his funeral, presenter Linda McDermott described Howe as "irreplaceable", and said he "radiated love of people and of life, and of great kindness". He loved the bright and colourful - particularly pink, the colour he painted his house. So it was no surprise that in 2006 he named his landmark Â£3m salon the Bling Bling building. The Hanover Street salon was designed by architect Piers Gough as a place to match his vibrant and theatrical personality - and was soon frequented by the great and good on the city. Herbert even tried his hand at politics - if only briefly. He stood for Mayor of Liverpool in 2012, launching his campaign with a champagne reception and promising to give his mayor's salary to youth groups, but quickly withdrew because of what he described as the "viperous attitude" of local politics. But friends say his greatest legacy will be his charity work. Ms McDermott remembered how he took hundreds of young carers to Blackpool and Gulliver's World theme park and was moved to tears by a letter from a young boy thanking him. She said Howe once brought 40 children from Chernobyl into his salon to treat them to cakes and haircuts. He set up Queenie's Christmas Charity in 2007 in memory of his mother, who died of Parkinson's Disease. It provides Christmas dinner at the city's famous Adelphi Hotel, for people who would be alone on Christmas day,  as well as supporting Barnardo's young carers by providing food and gifts. Howe had said he wanted to be remembered as "Liverpool's Father Christmas". Fellow hairdresser Andrew Collinge said he was "a great man - as we know a much loved part of Liverpool - and a great hairdresser" whose "work for good causes was unparalleled". Actor Ricky Tomlinson called Howe "a champion of the underdog", who "cared about people who weren't as lucky or fortunate as himself". Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson earlier said on Twitter he was an ambassador for the city and that there was "less glitter" now he has gone.	Mayoral candidate, friend to the stars, charity fundraiser, lover of pink and hairdresser extraordinaire - Liverpool has been saying goodbye to the much loved Herbert Howe.
The central bank voted unanimously to raise the key rate to a range of 0.5% to 0.75%, citing a stronger economic growth and rising employment. But the central bank said it expected the economy to need only "gradual" increases in the short term. Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen said the economic outlook was "highly uncertain" and the rise was only a "modest shift". However, the new Donald Trump administration could mean rates having to rise at a faster pace next year, she signalled at a news conference after the announcement. The president-elect has promised policies to boost growth through tax cuts, spending and deregulation. A US rate rise - how am I affected? US rate rise: Should Asia worry? Ms Yellen said it was wrong to speculate on Mr Trump's economic strategy without more details. But she added that some members of the Federal Open Markets Committee, the body which sets rates, have factored in to their forecasts an increase in spending. As a consequence, the FOMC said it now expects three rate rises next year rather than the two that were predicted in September. Ms Yellen told the news conference: "We are operating under a cloud of uncertainty... All the FOMC participants recognise that there is considerable uncertainty about how economic policy may change and what effect they may have on the economy." Also, she declined to be drawn on Mr Trump's public comments about the Fed, and his use of tweets to announce policy and criticise companies. "I'm a strong believer in the independence of the Fed," she told journalists. "I am not going to offer the incoming president advice." The interest rate move had been widely expected, and followed the last increase a year ago. Rates have been near zero since the global financial crisis. But the US economy is recovering, underlined by recent data on consumer confidence, jobs, house prices and growth in manufacturing and services. Ms Yellen said the rate rise "should certainly be understood as a reflection of the confidence we have in the progress that the economy has made and our judgment that that progress will continue". Although inflation is still below the Fed's 2% target, it expects the rise in prices to pick up gradually over the medium term. "The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate," the Fed statement said. It added: "The federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run." The Fed also published its economic forecasts for the next three years. These suggest that the Federal Funds rate may rise to 1.4% next year; 2.1% in 2018; and 2.9% in 2019. GDP growth will rise to 2.1% next year and stay there, more or less, during those years. The unemployment rate will fall to 4.5% over the 2017-2019 period, the Fed forecast. And inflation will rise to 1.9% next year and hover at that level for the next two years. The dollar rose 0.5% against the euro to â‚¬0.9455, and was 0.9% higher against the yen at 116.17 yen. Wall Street's main stock markets were largely unmoved immediately after the Fed's announcement, but drifted lower later. The Dows Jones index closed down 0.6%, and the S&P 500 was 0.8% lower. There's a name missing from the Federal Reserve's statement - Donald Trump. The president-elect's surprise triumph at the polls last month has turned out to be a short term boost to the US economy. Stock markets have surged higher, and consumer confidence indicators show US consumers feeling even more upbeat. The challenge for the Fed is working out what his election may mean to the economy in the next year or so. The most obvious likely impact could come from tax cuts which both he and the Republican Congress seem to favour. Less certain is an infrastructure spending spree that Mr Trump would evidently like, but which many in Congress are less keen on. If Janet Yellen and her colleagues considered these political issues, they weren't mentioned in the official statement on monetary policy. Nevertheless Mr Trump has a way of breaking in to most conversations these days. And the first question asked of Ms Yellen at her press conference duly concerned America's next president - and she admitted that Mr Trump's impact on US tax and spending policies might have influenced some of her colleagues forecasts for next year.	The US Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.25%, only the second increase in a decade.

The frontier is shut but Turkey has said it is prepared to feed and shelter the refugees. In the past few days, the Syrian army backed by Russian air power has made a series of gains in Aleppo province. The advance threatens to encircle the city of Aleppo, Syria's largest, landing a major blow to the rebels. Nato has accused Russia of "undermining" Syrian peace efforts through its strikes, which it says are mainly aimed at opposition groups. But Russia insists it only targets what it calls terrorists. On Friday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused Russia of being engaged in an "invasion" of Syria, saying it was trying to create a "boutique state" for President Bashar al-Assad, an ally of the Kremlin. Mr Erdogan said Russia and the Syrian government were together responsible for 400,000 deaths in Syria. Turkey and Russia have been embroiled in a row since Turkey shot down a Russian jet it accused of violating its airspace in November. According to the UN, up to 20,000 Syrians have gathered at the Bab al-Salam border crossing. "Humanitarian organisations are responding to the needs of those displaced, but ongoing military conflict is making access to populations in need increasingly difficult," the UN's Linda Tom told the AFP news agency. She said another 5,000-10,000 displaced people had gathered at Azaz, a north-western Syrian city close to the Turkish frontier. March 2011: Anti-government protests erupt across Syria, but Aleppo is initially untouched due to a state crackdown February 2012: As the rebellion turns into a conflict, clashes between rebels and the government are reported with increasing frequency in Aleppo province July 2012: The battle for Aleppo begins. Rebels make swift advances, but are unable to consolidate their gains and the city becomes divided 2013: The government begins bombarding rebel districts with barrel bombs, causing thousands of casualties September 2015: Syria launches a fresh offensive in the wake of Russia's intervention in the conflict February 2016: The government captures towns north of Aleppo, threatening to encircle the city Aleppo profile Separately, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said 15,000 people had arrived at the border. In a televised speech, he said Turkey would not leave them "without food or shelter" but would not say if they would be allowed in. Friday saw further gains for the Syrian government on the ground, recapturing the town of Ratyan, north of Aleppo. Earlier in the week, it claimed a major victory by breaking the rebel siege of two towns in Aleppo province, severing an opposition supply line from Turkey to Aleppo city. "It feels like a siege of Aleppo is about to begin," said a spokesman for aid group Mercy Corps, David Evans, who said the main humanitarian route was cut off. Since 2012, Aleppo has been divided into rebel and government-held areas. Before the conflict it was a key commercial centre and home to over two million people. Why is there a war in Syria? Anti-government protests developed into a civil war that, four years on, has ground to a stalemate, with the Assad government, the so-called Islamic State group, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all holding territory. Who is fighting whom? Government forces concentrated in Damascus and the centre and west of Syria are fighting the jihadists of Islamic State and al-Nusra Front, as well as less numerous so-called "moderate" rebel groups, which are strongest in the north and east. These groups are also battling each other. More than 250,000 Syrians have been killed and a million injured. Some 11 million others have been forced from their homes, of whom four million have fled abroad - including growing numbers who are making the dangerous journey to Europe. How has the world reacted? Iran, Russia and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement are propping up the Alawite-led Assad government, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar back the more moderate Sunni-dominated opposition, along with the US, UK and France. Hezbollah and Iran are believed to have troops and officers on the ground, while a Western-led coalition and Russia are carrying out air strikes.	At least 15,000 Syrian refugees fleeing fighting in northern Aleppo province have gathered at a border crossing with Turkey, UN and Turkish officials said.
One of Tata's two galvanised steel lines could be closed from the end of October or November, according to Keith Jordan from the Community union. The company said the line could be restarted in better market conditions. Last month, Tata announced it was mothballing part of its plant in Newport for the third time in six years with the loss of hundreds of jobs. Mr Jordan said it was hoped many of the Shotton workers will be moved to the second line, which produces 350,000 tonnes of steel per year or 7,000 tonnes per week. The Shotton site is part of Tata Steel Colors which produces metallic and paint coated products for the construction industry and domestic appliances. A company spokesman said: "We continue to be in discussions with employees, their representatives and the employers of contractors and agency staff about possible implications for employment levels. "Every effort will be made to redeploy any affected employees within the business."	A production line at Deeside's Shotton steelworks is being mothballed which could affect 40 jobs, a union has said.
Lesbos used to get more than 5,000 a day. On Monday there were just four. But with Europe's borders closed, more than 50,000 migrants remain in Greece waiting for a decision about their futures. Angus Crawford visited three sites to find out how they are living. Miracle is sleeping. He cannot tell me anything about the conditions in Moria camp. He is unaware of the smell of raw sewage that hangs around the entrance gate.  He does not know about the fighting between migrants that insiders say breaks out on a regular basis. Luckily on Tuesday the tear gas fired by police at young migrants throwing stones never reached him. He does not have to stand in line for hours to get food. Miracle is just 10 months old and is strapped to his mother's back. She tells me her name is Blessing. She says she is Nigerian, a Christian from Kano, and that she left because of the Islamist militants, Boko Haram. I have no way of independently checking her story. But here she is in Moria, once a transit camp for migrants, now since the EU deal with Turkey, a detention centre, run by central government. There are several thousand people inside even though it was never built to house so many. It is another sign of how Greece was simply overwhelmed by the numbers who came, while itself in the middle of an economic crisis. Most of those who arrived before March 20, the start of the EU-Turkey agreement, are free to come and go, but cannot leave the island. Those who came after that date are locked in, waiting for a decision about their asylum claims. Moria's chain link fence, topped with razor wire, snakes on its way up into olive groves.  It surrounds a collection of converted shipping containers, large white plastic shelters and small tents. I meet one man who says simply, "in here, I fear for my life". 'A hellish Glastonbury' Five minutes drive away, another camp. There is no razor wire, no police guarding the gate. The first thing I see is an electronic display board. It reads "the camp director wishes you a pleasant and safe stay". There are orderly lines of white UN refugee agency tents. Children run up and down the pathways between them. This is run by the council, for migrants who arrived before the 20th, and for the vulnerable: families with children, pregnant women and the disabled. They can leave the camp, but not Lesbos. One aid worker tells me it is the best camp he has seen. It sits on top of a hill, surrounded on three sides by the Aegean. In the distance lie the ruins of a castle. The facilities may be better and site picturesque, but those who I meet inside tell me it is still in effect an open air waiting room. Amiyah is 19 and from Damascus. The rest of her family are in Germany. But she cannot join them. Abdul, who is 16, complains about the food and says everyone is getting sick. Tareq tells me he had only â‚¬50 left after paying a smuggler, but yesterday even that was stolen. The migrant crisis in seven charts The Plaza is an eight storey hotel not far from the centre of Athens. It has three stars and more than 60 rooms. There are more than 140 guests, but none of them have to pay to stay. The hotel was a casualty of the economic crash, going bankrupt in 2010 and closing its doors. But last Friday a group of activists and former workers unlawfully reopened the Plaza, with migrants as guests. The reception is manned by volunteers 24 hours a day and the kitchen turns out food. There are more than 70 children staying here. When we visit there is laughter and singing from the playroom on the first floor. And in a rack by the entrance, yellowing maps of Athens still waiting for the tourists who never came.	There has been a dramatic reduction in the number of migrants arriving in Greece since an agreement between Turkey and the EU came into force.
And I don't get to say that very often. On the one hand, eurocrats were hurried - in wind and rain - into EU courtyards to stand in photo-op-ready groups to form the number 60. (It's the EU's 60th birthday celebration this Saturday.) And on the other - after months of cajoling, thinly-veiled frustration and angst from Brussels - the UK government finally made clear the date it will officially trigger the Brexit process. Next Wednesday. But whereas Saturday really is a huge deal for the EU - marking decades of togetherness at a time when the union is very much under threat from populist nationalism across the EU, inequality and discord in the eurozone, migration complications and Brexit itself, of course - next Wednesday, while an historic day in the UK, will not play out so big this side of the Channel. There is a determination here that Brexit must no longer be allowed to dominate and overshadow EU politics as it has done since way before the UK referendum even. One high-level source told me that after Brussels received Britain's formal notification of its intention to leave, Brexit would immediately be downgraded to one of many EU issues to be dealt with, rather than The Big Thing. "There will be no major political apocalyptic show," he assured me. But of course, the underlying EU fear remains that if a Brexit deal is too sweet for the UK, other countries may be inspired to also walk out the door. Brussels officials are grateful that Theresa May did not trigger Article 50 this week, so close to the EU's birthday bash. The tone there will be resolutely upbeat, rather than focused on one of its key members leaving the club. As for the what-happens-next with Brexit, the rule in Brussels is: don't expect too much too fast. Ever. The remaining 27 EU leaders, or at least their teams, began getting diaries together on Monday. To fix a date (expected in around five or six weeks) for that all-important summit when they'll agree their red lines and guidelines for Brexit negotiations. The European Commission will lead the UK talks from the EU side - but all the initial meetings will be about who will meet, when, in which country, discussing what and in which order. Most probably little of substance will be achieved before the autumn. The EU prefers to get the key elections coming up in big-hitters France and Germany out the way first. But any delay is painful for the UK. The Article 50 timer is set for two years and the clock starts ticking next Wednesday.	Brussels was abuzz on Monday.
One person died when a car, a van pulling a trailer and a lorry crashed between junctions 10 and 10a on Sunday at about 15:00 BST. Major repair work was needed to the motorway surface with leaking fuel suspected to have caused damage, said West Midlands Police. The road was closed for about 15 hours with tailbacks to junction 7. The hard shoulder could remain shut for repairs for two days. Highways England described it as a "complex recovery operation overnight".	The M6 motorway between Wolverhampton and Walsall has reopened after a fatal crash.
Martin made 38 appearances last season for Livi, scoring five goals, as they finished sixth, one place above Rovers. He was in his second spell with the West Lothian club, with whom he started his career. Scott went on to play for Ross County and Hibernian, who farmed him back to the Dingwall club on loan. He switched back to Livingston last summer.	Raith Rovers have signed Martin Scott after the 28-year-old midfielder was released by Scottish Championship rivals Livingston.
Jamie Stevenson's entry, which incorporates a saltire, their black and white colours and their nickname - The Honest Men, won 48% of the votes. The Scottish Championship club were forced to find a new crest as their old one broke ancient heraldic law. Designs were whittled down to a shortlist of five that were voted on by the public. Commercial manager Graeme Miller told his club website: "Nobody wanted to change our badge. "However, when left with no option, I think the route we chose to take has been a hugely positively one. "We visited numerous local schools with our players and mascot Pandamonium and the response from the kids was incredible. "Hundreds of entries were sent in from local youngsters and hopefully the excitement generated when we visited them will have given them an interest in the club for the future." Winning designer Stevenson, who has lived in Peru for five years, attended his first Ayr match in 1979 and went on to design the club's match-day programme. A badge containing an anchor, representing Ayr's proximity to the sea, came second with 25%. The new badge will be adopted from 1 July.	An Ayr United fan living in Peru has designed the winner of an online poll to choose a new club badge.
This year's award was won jointly by Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the president of Liberia, Leymah Gbowee, the Liberian peace activist, and Yemeni pro-democracy campaigner Tawakkol Karman. They were recognised for their "non-violent struggle" for women's safety and for women's rights to participate in peace-building work. Chinese lawyer Liu Xiaobo won in 2010. Each of this year's winners was presented with a gold medal and a diploma. The prize money of $1.5 million (Â£958,000) will be shared between them. Mrs Sirleaf, 72, is Africa's first elected female head of state and is credited with helping to end Liberia's 14 year civil war. The announcement of her award came days before the country's presidential election. She went on to win a run-off poll last month but her rival boycotted the vote alleging the first round was rigged. The Liberian president told delegates that she was honoured to be following in the footsteps of the Africans who had won the prize before her, including South Africa's Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Kofi Annan, the Ghana-born former UN secretary-general. Mrs Sirleaf also expressed her "deepest sympathy" for the people of Norway in the wake of the twin attacks carried out by Anders Behring Breivik on 22 July that led to the deaths of 77 people. "On behalf of all the women of Liberia, the women of Africa, and women everywhere in the world who have struggled for peace, justice and equality, I accept with humility the 2011 Nobel Prize for Peace," she said. Ms Gbowee, 39, led a peaceful campaign to end Liberia's civil war and oust its ex-President Charles Taylor. She said: "I am humbled and honoured to have been selected and I receive the prize in the name of women who continue to work for peace, equality and justice across the world." "I believe that the prize this year not only recognises our struggle in Liberia and Yemen. "It is in recognition and honour of the struggles of grass roots women in Egypt, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cote d'Ivoire [Ivory Coast], Tunisia, in Palestine and Israel, and in every troubled corner of the world." Ms Karman, a 32-year-old mother of three, founded the organisation Women Journalists Without Chains in 2005 and becomes the first Arab woman to win the prize. 'Freedom and dignity' Addressing the audience in Arabic, she said: "Thank you for the award, which I consider as an honour to me personally, to my country Yemen, to Arab women, to all women of the world, and to all people aspiring to freedom and dignity. Recent Nobel Peace Prize winners "I accept the award on my behalf and on behalf of the Yemeni and Arab revolutionary youth, who are leading today's peaceful struggle against tyranny and corruption with moral courage and political wisdom." Speaking before the presentation at Oslo's City Hall, Thorbjorn Jagland, the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said: "We congratulate this year's winners of the Nobel Peace Prize. "You represent one of the most important motive forces for change in today's world, the struggle for human rights in general and the struggle of women for equality and peace in particular." The Nobel committee received a record 241 nominations for the 2011 prize. The first Nobel peace prize was awarded in 1901 and the award takes its name from the Swedish scientist Alfred Nobel.	The 2011 Nobel Peace Prize has been presented to three women at a ceremony in the Norwegian capital, Oslo.
Head of a Young Woman (1906) is worth more than Â£17m (25m euros). The painting is the property of Jaime Botin, a Spanish banking tycoon. It was declared a "historical heritage asset of exceptional importance" by the Spanish National Court and refused an export permit. An attempt to export the painting to Switzerland on Thursday "drew the attention of French officials". Customs authorities boarded the vessel the following day and found the painting. The captain could only present two documents regarding the work of art, one of which was, in fact, the May 2015 Spanish Court judgement ordering that it not be taken out of the country. Mr Botin, 79, whose family founded the Santander banking group, was not on board. The boat, which sports a British flag, is registered to a British company of which Mr Botin is a shareholder, according to a customs authority spokesperson. An export request was filed for the painting in December 2012 to move it to London, but was opposed by Spain's culture minister. French customs officials are now awaiting an official Spanish request to recover the painting.	A Picasso painting barred from leaving Spain has been seized by French authorities from a boat docked in Corsica.
The girl, who suffered "extensive dog bite wounds to her face" in the attack in Stoke-on-Trent, is being treated at Birmingham Children's Hospital. Her condition is "serious" but not thought to be life-threatening. Her family remain at her bedside. Staffordshire Police said the dog had been taken to specialist kennels. Emergency services were called to Pretoria Road in Etruria at 10:20 BST. Officers said they understood the attack took place in the garden of the property. West Midlands Ambulance Service said the girl was airlifted for "emergency care and surgery". "The girl, who was understandably upset, was given pain relief to help ease her discomfort before ambulance staff assessed her nasty wounds and applied dressings." "Her condition was said to be serious but stable," the ambulance service said.	A six-year-old girl is undergoing surgery after being attacked by a Staffordshire bull terrier, police have said.
Mr Haldane, added that any rate rise would "increase unnecessarily the chances of the economy falling below critical velocity". He is considered to be the most cautious policy-maker when it comes to raising interest rates. Interest rates have been at 0.5% since 2009 and the financial crisis. The first increase is now expected in late 2016. Forecasts were put back after the Bank of England's last inflation report in which the Bank said the outlook for global growth had weakened. In a speech to trade union body the TUC, Mr Haldane also indicated that the next rate move could equally be a cut rather than a rise. "Now more than ever in the UK, policy needs to be poised to move off either foot depending on which way the data break," he said in his speech. Mr Haldane said that because wage growth could be weaker than currently expected, inflation may undershoot the Bank's November predictions, when it estimated that inflation would rise above its 2% target in two years. The Consumer Price Index currently stands at 0.1%. "Against that backdrop, my view is that the case for raising interest rates is still some way from being made," Mr Haldane said. "Whatever the reason, the economic aircraft appears to be losing speed on the runway. That is an awkward, indeed risky, time to be contemplating take-off. "Meanwhile, inflationary trends do not at present give me sufficient confidence that inflation will be back at target, even two years hence." Mr Haldane also had strong words on the UK's increasingly expensive housing market. "The UK housing market is broken," he told the TUC meeting. "There is a chronic and accumulated imbalance between demand and supply, and it is that which is sending skyward - and has sent skyward - house prices."	The Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, has warned that the UK's "economic aircraft appears to be losing speed on the runway".
Scottish Hydro-Electric Transmission Ltd, a division of energy giant SSE, submitted the "needs case" as part of the planning process for the cable. After assessing the case, energy regulator Ofgem has asked for further details to be submitted. The project has been hit by delays and a rise in costs to an estimated Â£780m. Islands local authority, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, has said major renewable energy projects planned for the isles cannot go ahead without the cable. The interconnector would export electricity to the mainland for distribution. It would stretch to about 50 miles (80km) from Gravir on Lewis to Ullapool on the north-west coast of mainland Scotland. The Scottish government has been involved in talks on the project. A spokesperson said: "This is a matter for SSE and Ofgem, but we would encourage the company and regulator to move swiftly to resolve this issue. "Improved grid connections will enable the huge renewable energy resources of Scotland's islands to create jobs - up to 3,500 jobs in the Western Isles, almost 2,900 in the Shetlands and over 4,500 in the Orkney Islands by 2030. The spokesperson added: "SSE put a business case for the Western Isles link to the electricity regulator Ofgem on 14 June, and today Ofgem have responded by setting out the detailed further information they require."	Ofgem has asked for more information on why a subsea cable is needed to carry electricity generated on the Western Isles to the mainland.
This is not because of panic, but possibly as a way of suppressing it. As one MP put it: "The wise heads will need to tell any hotheads to calm down." The prime minister will meet her internal critics head on. Having phoned over the weekend candidates who were defeated in an election she didn't need to call, she will find that many of those who escaped that fate are cross. But widespread demands for her to go are not expected. Instead, there will be demands for her to consult more, including meeting regularly with the 1922 executive, and to turn Downing Street from a bunker into an open house by broadening her range of staff. However, few MPs expect her position to be strong and stable for the next five years. One senior backbencher told me: "It is inconceivable she will lead the party into the next election. Her authority has been diminished unquestionably." Another said: "Party members have been too bruised by her." "She has bought herself some time", said a senior backbencher, but added: "How she behaves will determine how long she's there." There is a feeling that the party is holding on to nurse for fear of something worse. "There is zero appetite for another election," as one MP put it, and a feeling that, in an early poll, victory wouldn't be guaranteed. Some say Labour's digital campaign and mobilisation of young people was particularly impressive, and another election would give Jeremy Corbyn the opportunity to do what he does best - campaign. Equally, a leadership election could be destabilising ahead of Brexit talks - though it's widely expected one will take place well before 2022. Some kind of arrangement with the DUP is seen as inevitable, but one MP cautioned "the devil is in the detail". One of the reasons the 1922 meeting has been moved forward is so any deal can be discussed before it is sealed. Nonetheless, it is anticipated that the most flexible of arrangements is likely to be put in place; one that would mean there would have to be negotiations with the DUP on an issue-by-issue basis. Theresa May is expected to hear strong criticisms of what one backbencher dubbed "her miserable manifesto". Of course, some individual policies, such as social care - "It went down like a lead balloon" - will be singled out, but the presentation of policy will also be attacked. MPs will say that an effective fourfold lifting of the floor on residential care costs wasn't widely understood. And a campaign which barely mentioned the economy will come under fire. "We didn't dodge a bullet but were winged," said one. "If Labour had a more credible leader we could have been in even bigger difficulties." There has been speculation that there may now be a "softer Brexit", partly because of an influx of Scottish MPs who favour close trading relationships with the EU, but also because of the elevation of Damian Green to First Secretary of State. He is a friend of Mrs May's, a Remainer in the referendum campaign, and he has warned that concessions may have to be made in negotiations. But some senior Tories have told me that they will urge her to stick to her manifesto commitments on Brexit and, for them, controls on immigration and coming out of the single market are "bottom lines". Others will want to insist on the freedom to strike trade deals, so coming out of the customs union is seen as essential. "We must hold our nerve on Brexit," said one. However, another senior backbencher recognised that it would now be inevitable that Parliament would have greater influence over the process. "She will be walking a tightrope", and, while MPs seem to see the necessity, in the words of one former minister, to "shore her up in the short term", if she stumbles, she can fall at any time.	A meeting of the Conservative Party's influential backbench 1922 committee - in effect all Conservative backbenchers - has been brought forward by 24 hours to 17:00 BST on Monday.
Anastasia Deyeva, 24, has been appointed a deputy interior minister, unprecedented for anyone of her age. And some Ukrainians think she is not qualified for the job. "There's nothing wrong about a woman being an adviser, especially if she's pretty and smart," was one typical comment on Facebook. "But it's very wrong if she's that young and has no experience. Or the wrong kind of experience." As debate swirled around Ms Deyeva's appointment, another young woman was selected for the highly charged job of running a campaign to purge the government of corrupt officials. Anna Kalynchuk, 23, studied law and was already part of the government's anti-corruption department. Ms Deyeva had to deal with closer scrutiny than most public officials when nude photos of her were posted online. More tasteful pictures have since appeared on Ukrainian lifestyle website Style Insider. Nothing to do with her work, insisted Ms Deyeva. She defended her credentials, telling one interviewer (in Russian) she had exactly the right experience for the job. She was an aide to an MP, worked for a Swedish energy company and was considered suitably qualified enough to be offered an interior ministry job in 2015. But her promotion to become Ukraine's youngest ever deputy minster unleashed a torrent of criticism. "I knew that I'd end up in the limelight, that there would be criticism and biased commentary. But I never expected such vile attacks," she says. Ms Deyeva's boss, Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, is firmly behind her. "The main thing people have against her is that she's young," he wrote on his Facebook page (in Russian), adding that the criticism was based on outdated attitudes. "In the Soviet tradition, this sort of job was for a monster, but we've hired a girl. Maybe so, only we do things differently in my ministry," he said. He is not alone in thinking it is time for Ukraine to move on. "I am extremely glad that you're one generation younger than me," wrote Denis Kazvan, formerly an interior ministry adviser. "People like you do not need to spend 40 years wandering through the desert to get rid of the Soviet gene of slavery. People like you are free inside."

Governor Jerry Brown said the fires, which have left one person dead, destroyed and threatened buildings in the Napa and Lake counties. More than 1,300 people fled Middletown, north of San Francisco, as their homes were consumed by the flames. Four firefighters who were badly burned are receiving treatment in hospital. Wildfires were still burning on Monday after devastating homes and apartment blocks over the weekend. The woman who died was a disabled 72-year-old retired teacher, Barbara McWilliams, who lived on her own in Lake County on Cobb Mountain. Her carer, Jennifer Hittson, told the local media she had advanced multiple sclerosis that meant she was unable to walk unaided. Ms Hittson said she had asked the authorities to help her but by the time they got there, her home was already engulfed in flames. You can smell the so-called Valley Fire before you see it. An acrid stench hangs in the air on the road to Middletown. Smoke is thick in the sky, smothering the pines and the dry brush on the hillsides. But it does not prepare you for the devastation in the little town itself. Home after home lies in ruins. Families who have lost everything have returned to pick through the debris but there doesn't appear to be anything to salvage. Some houses have survived with scorch marks. Others are unscathed. But everyone here is stunned by the speed and ferocity of the fire which swept through in minutes, whipped up by a harsh, dry wind. In the heart of this tight-knit community, a twisted mass of metal and ashes was, we are told, an apartment block of nearly 50 homes. The people of Middletown say they will rebuild. That will not be easy. Raging fires prompt drone law change Up to 1,000 structures, which includes barns and sheds, have been burned, fire agency spokesman Daniel Berlant said. The fires across northern California are being blamed on high temperatures and years of drought. The state spent $212m (Â£137m) fighting the flames in July alone, California's forestry and fire protection department spokesman Daniel Berlant told the AFP news agency. He said more than 275 homes and other buildings had been destroyed and the Red Cross is opening emergency shelters for evacuated residents. One blaze, the Valley Fire, which started on Saturday in Lake County, is said to have burned 40,000 acres (16,190 hectares). It reached the centre of the small town of Middletown on Sunday. Its 1,500 residents had already been ordered to evacuate. The fire spread quickly and witnesses saw flames reach up to 200ft (60m) in the air, according to local news reports. Further east, in Amador and Calaveras counties, around 4,000 firefighters were battling the Butte Fire, which broke out on Wednesday. That blaze has so far destroyed around 65,000 acres (26,300 hectares) along with 86 homes and 51 outbuildings. It is only 15% contained and threatens more than 6,000 other buildings, officials say. Further south, beyond Fresno, firefighters have been tackling the largest of the blazes, the so-called Rough Fire, which has claimed 128,800 acres (52,000 hectares) since it began in late July. Nearly 3,000 firefighters are tackling that blaze, which is now said to be 29% contained. They have evacuated the Kings Canyon National Park  and working to protect the park's famous grove of Giant Sequoia trees.	The governor of California has declared a state of emergency after wildfires forced about 23,000 people to flee their homes in the north of the state.
Media playback is not supported on this device Kubica suffered a partially severed right hand in a rally accident on the eve of the 2011 season and has not recovered enough movement to return. "I miss racing in F1, yes," he said in an exclusive BBC Sport interview before this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix. "When you do everything you can to be an F1 driver and suddenly it stops, it's not painful but it's definitely not something you were looking for." Media playback is not supported on this device The Polish driver is competing this year in the European Rally Championship for Citroen and is doing work for the Mercedes F1 team in their simulator as he continues his recovery. He says he is still some way from being able to compete in F1 because of the restricted movement of his arm and fingers. "I have suffered big injuries in the rally crash," the 28-year-old said, "but I am still lucky I am able to drive on a high level, although not any more in F1. "Driving F1 would not be such a big problem, the problem would be to drive a complete race in all circuits but unfortunately that is not possible for now. "The problem in F1 is the space. Maybe one day if the FIA say the car has to be 10-15 cm wider, I can drive - but it is not that rally is second choice. "What is important for me is I am seeing progress. Even if in normal life I struggle with using the hand, [but] driving I see the progress, in the rally car, in the simulator. "The question is how far I will go and how long it will take but to be honest it really doesn't matter if it will take one month, one year or 10 years, maybe one day I will have chance to drive F1 again." Kubica, who won the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix for BMW Sauber and finished eighth in the world championship in his maiden season with Renault in 2010, was considered one of the very best drivers in the sport at the time of his crash. He admitted the past two years had been difficult for him to handle. But asked whether he was still in love with motorsport, he said: "I think more. I was always thinking I was very lucky to be in F1. "I spent a hard time after the accident for many months - I would say maybe even for nearly two years - not just because of the surgeries, the recovery and the pain but afterwards because when you recover you lie down in the hospital, you start missing it and then you realise how much maybe not love but affection you have for the sport." He added: "I paid quite a big price for a mistake but I could have paid a much higher price, that's for sure. "It is unfortunately part of this sport that you have to accept. If you are driving you are not thinking about this. If you don't accept, you don't do it." Kubica made it clear he still prioritised success in F1 over rallying but said he would not try to rush his recovery. He said: "What I learned is that because of my situation I cannot look too much forward. I have to look week after week, day after day and move forward, that's the most important."

The proportion was significantly higher than those who received the special measure in state schools where the figure is fewer than one in eight. The difference has come to light following an analysis of official exam data by BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Exams watchdog Ofqual said this may be because of the readiness of schools to find students entitled to more time. HMC, a group representing independent schools, said the higher rate was down to "proper resourcing" which it said "can be be lacking in state maintained schools". But the head teacher of a comprehensive school in Suffolk said the different rates raised "serious questions". Students receive extra time, typically more than three hours to complete a two-and-a-half hour exam, because of special needs or disabilities like dyslexia. The system has previously faced claims that better resourced schools may be more likely to receive the measure, which is available as part of rules to ensure a level playing field for exam candidates. Last year in GCSE and A-level exams, extra time was awarded to more than 27,000 independent school students -  which represented nearly 20% of all candidates in the sector. In state institutions, around 200,000 students received extra time, which represented less than 12% of all state sector students taking the exams. The total number of students awarded extra time in England, Wales and Northern Ireland has increased every year since 2011. Ofqual has previously introduced measures to try to reduce requests for so-called Access Arrangements after claims the system was being abused. The Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) which represents the UK's biggest exam boards, said it was important the arrangements were approved only for those who needed them. In a statement, it said: "There's a rigorous process to ensure this, including annual inspections, and we review this process every year. "Fairness is ensured by the process being the same, irrespective of location or type of school or college." Geoff Barton, head teacher of King Edward VI comprehensive school in Bury St Edmunds, blamed a "high stakes" accountability system including results and league tables for influencing schools' use of the measure. He said: "Whether they are getting special consideration does seem to be something that isn't only done in the interests of the youngster, but also can have an effect for the school. "So there's no surprise that schools will reflect on that as they are planning the exam season." He added: "What the data does is to raise some serious questions for schools." Peter Hamilton, HMC's academic policy spokesman and headmaster of Harberdashers' Aske's Boys' School in Borehamwood, said the independent sector was able to apply for help for pupils "because of ever-improving monitoring and awareness of special needs". He said: "We are also fortunate to have proper resourcing and specialist departments, which can be lacking in state maintained schools. "All heads want to see learning support staff given the time and money necessary to ensure all pupils are able to claim their rights." The watchdog said the data did indicate some variation between types of examination centres. It said the difference could be partly explained "by the ability and readiness of centres to identify students who are entitled to a reasonable adjustment". Both state and private sectors involved in the data comparison include special schools, whose students are more likely to require access arrangements. Ofqual said the private sector figures included independent special schools which may impact upon the percentages when making comparisons. An independent special schools source said the numbers of students involved in such exams was relatively low. It's thought unlikely to have a significant impact on the comparison between sectors. A charity that supports people with dyslexia has previously said schools needed better training to get pupils assessed, adding that students did not need formal or costly diagnoses to qualify for access arrangements. The Today programme first used freedom of information laws in 2014 to ask JCQ for figures on access arrangements in various types of schools. Following a ruling by the Information Commissioner, it emerged that the data would be supplied by exam boards to Ofqual.	One in five students in independent schools received extra time to complete GCSE and A-level exams last year.
Employers with 11 or more parking spaces now have to pay Nottingham City Council £288 a year per space under the Workplace Parking Levy. Many employers have decided to pass on some or all of the charge to their staff while some have reduced their numbers of car parking spaces. Bristol City Council is considering a similar scheme. The Nottingham scheme will raise £2m less than the council predicted because employers have registered fewer spaces than expected. Among the employees avoiding the charge is Kofi Ohene-Djan from the Capital FM Arena. "I'm going to be cycling in," he said. "I live in Nottingham so I'm going to be on my bike." Mr Ohene-Djan's colleagues have been given the option of paying their employer £52 per year for a parking permit. The arena will pay the remainder of the Workplace Parking Levy, which rises to £380 by 2015. Motoring organisations the AA and the RAC both predicted that the scheme will damage the economy. AA president Edmund King said: "At a time when drivers are facing record prices at the pumps, further charges for parking at work are the last thing they need. "This damaging 'tax on work' should be stopped from spreading elsewhere as it will damage the economy and hit employees who just can't afford it." Mr Ohene-Djan was asked if he wanted to pay for a permit when he started his job last month. "I probably would have done a bit of both [cycling and driving] but I will definitely be on my bike now," he said. Employers exempt from paying the levy include the Best Western Hotel, on Mansfield Road, Carrington. General manager Phil Rea said: "We are not affected because it only affects staff parking. "At any one time I don't have more than seven staff cars on the car park." Employers have had to register spaces from 1 October, but charging was timed to begin from this financial year. The council has introduced the levy to pay for transport improvements, including the extension of Nottingham's tram network. Councillor Jane Urquhart, who is in charge of transport, said the council still expected to meet its target over the 23-year period of the levy, generating an average of £14m a year. It will raise £8m this year rather than the £10m expected. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: "The council blames commuters for Nottingham's congestion, but people travelling in to the city to work make it the prosperous place it is. "Officials recognise many firms might simply pass the charges on to employees, adding another financial burden on to car owners already facing crippling running costs."	A levy which charges employers for their staff to park at work has begun in Nottingham.
Media playback is not supported on this device Southgate, 46, stepped up from his role as England Under-21s manager in September following Sam Allardyce's departure after only 67 days in charge. He oversaw two wins and two draws as interim boss and has signed a contract reportedly worth up to £2m a year. "I have thoroughly enjoyed working with the players over these past four games and I think there is huge potential," said Southgate. "I am extremely proud to be appointed England manager. However, I am also conscious getting the job is one thing, now I want to do the job successfully. "I'm determined to give everything I have to give the country a team that they're proud of and one that they're going to enjoy watching play and develop." Media playback is not supported on this device Former defender Southgate, who made 57 appearances for England as a player, becomes the fourth permanent manager of the national team in as many years. The ex-Middlesbrough boss oversaw a comfortable World Cup qualifying win against minnows Malta, before his team laboured to a goalless draw in Slovenia. He took a significant step towards being appointed full-time manager with a 3-0 win against Scotland in qualifying earlier this month, before his team squandered a 2-0 friendly lead against Spain at Wembley to draw 2-2 four days later. Before becoming part of the international set-up, Southgate's only managerial experience was his three-year spell at Boro, who were relegated under him in 2009. Southgate's understanding of international football and the development set-up at St George's Park has proved important, according to Football Association chief executive Martin Glenn. "Gareth is a great ambassador for what the FA stands for, he's a very good football tactician and a leader, but beneath that he's a winner and that's an important part of the job," he added. Southgate's first competitive match in charge as permanent manager will be a friendly against Germany in Dortmund on 22 March. Media playback is not supported on this device England defender Gary Cahill: "He's been there. He's been an England player at major tournaments, has the experience and knows how the players are feeling and the pressure you're under in an England shirt. He can relate." England midfielder Jordan Henderson: "The manager has been brilliant. The players have got on really well with him. He gives responsibility to players and he listens." Former England defender Danny Mills: "The job he's done is impeccable. He's made big decisions. A lot of people say he's too nice. Yes, he's an absolute gentleman, and very articulate, intelligent, but he's got an edge." Former Scotland international Pat Nevin after England's win over Scotland: "Why do you have to give him the job now? There is no reason to do it. Wait until the summer and you have all sorts of options, one being Gareth still. England are going through anyway but you might be turning down the opportunity to get Arsene Wenger or someone of that ilk." Former senior FA executive Adrian Bevington: "I think he is suited to the ebb and flow, the rhythm of international football. The players want to play for him and he is suited to that job and deserves the opportunity." Southgate was given his first managerial job at Middlesbrough in 2006, when the then 35-year-old defender quit playing to take charge of his former side. He led the Teesside club for 151 matches between 2006 and 2009, presiding over their relegation from the Premier League before being sacked with the team fourth in the Championship. And his 28.4% win percentage in the league means he starts the England job with an unwanted record... After leaving Boro, Southgate joined the Football Association in January 2011 as head of elite development, becoming England Under-21 boss on a three-year contract in August 2013. Despite breezing through qualifying, the Young Lions failed to progress past the group stage at the 2015 European Championship. When Hodgson quit in the summer, Southgate ruled himself out of the running to replace him, with Steve Bruce and Allardyce among the interviewees. This time around it is not known whether anyone else was on the shortlist or even spoken to. Southgate was interviewed at St George's Park last Monday by a panel including FA chairman Greg Clarke, chief executive Martin Glenn, technical director Dan Ashworth, League Managers' Association chairman Howard Wilkinson and former England defender Graeme le Saux. Glenn said Southgate "performed extremely well" during the four games he was in temporary charge and "impressed us during a tough interview process". The only mark against Southgate's time as interim manager was the FA banning England players from having nights out on international duty after captain Wayne Rooney was pictured drinking at a wedding. Rooney apologised for the "inappropriate" images - taken on the evening after the Scotland game at the team hotel - while the FA was looking into reports that other squad members were out late three days before the Spain friendly. Media playback is not supported on this device Former England midfielder John Salako, who played with Southgate at Crystal Palace, speaking to the BBC. Gareth had an inner steel, an inner confidence. Captain Sensible we called him. First out to training, last off the training pitch. He was a bright, intelligent lad. Not the most gifted of players but he worked on everything so hard. Gareth was a real student of the game - he always had that aura about him that he could go on to be whatever he wanted to be. Getting arguably the biggest job in football, I perhaps didn't see that coming. But the opportunity has come along. We're in turmoil a little bit. Gareth's a safe pair of hands and I'm thinking why not? He's won the Toulon tournament, he knows the crop of youngsters coming through, he knows what English football is about. We want an Englishman in charge who was proud to put on that shirt, who knew what it was about, who had the passion to go and play for England. And he'll do that as England manager. Ok he hasn't managed at the top Premier League level, Champions League level, but I don't think that matters. Get behind him, give him the opportunity to go and be a great English manager. It is the perfect time for Gareth to step in. He'll do it from the heart, will use his head. No ego in it. He's not in it for the money, it's more about the prize of being England manager. Phil McNulty, chief football writer Southgate has rebuilt his managerial career since taking over as England Under-21 coach in August 2013. He endured a miserable Euros in 2015 when England's youngsters went out at the group stage but he was hampered by the FA's decision to omit players such as Raheem Sterling, Jack Wilshere and Ross Barkley. He saw the other side as England won this summer's prestigious Toulon tournament in France - but is this enough to warrant the top job? Southgate is steeped in FA tradition, having had an 18-month spell as its head of elite development between January 2011 and July 2012 before his return as England Under-21 boss. He knows what the England job entails after close contact with the likes of Roy Hodgson and Sam Allardyce and has clearly developed a taste for the pressures after his time in interim charge.

US markets had finished higher on expectations that job figures for February, due out later on Friday, will show a strong pace of growth. Asia's biggest market, Japan's Nikkei 225 closed 0.3% higher at 17,014.78. Shares in the embattled electronics firm Sharp rose 9.4% on new reports it was close to a deal with Taiwan's Foxconn. The jump came after the Nikkei business daily reported that Sharp and Foxconn parent company Hon Hai Precision Industry were continuing talks, with both sides seeking to conclude a takeover deal by Monday. Earlier talks had been delayed when Foxconn said it had received new information from Sharp which needed to be clarified. In Australia, the ASX 200 index finished the day up 0.2% at 5,090.02. Shares of commodity giant BHP Billiton rose 2.4%, with investors unfazed by a downgrade by credit ratings agency Moody's. Moody's cut its ratings of the Anglo-Australian firm to "A3" from "A1", citing the deterioration in the company's earnings and cash flow as reasons. The ratings agency also said it expected low commodity prices and softer demand to continue to affect BHP. In China, the mainland benchmark Shanghai Composite index closed up 0.5% at 2,874.15. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index ended up 1.2% at 20,176.70. Samsonite shares rose 1.3% as the company confirmed that it was taking over US luxury rival Tumi. In South Korea, the Kospi index finished down 0.1% at 1,955.63.	Shares across Asia traded mixed on Friday, failing to pick up the positive lead from Wall Street.
The group carried out a nine-month investigation into the 53,000 images handed to the opposition by a military police photographer, codenamed Caesar. Researchers interviewed former prisoners, defectors, forensic experts and families of the disappeared. Syria's government and its allies had questioned the images' authenticity. They were first published in January 2014 in a report by three former war crimes prosecutors that was commissioned by Qatar, which supports the political and armed opposition in Syria. In an interview earlier this year, President Bashar al-Assad said: "You can bring photographs from anyone and say this is torture. There is no verification of any of this evidence, so it's all allegations without evidence." But on Wednesday, Human Rights Watch laid out in a new report what it said was new evidence regarding the authenticity of the Caesar photographs, identifying a number of the victims and highlighting some of the key causes of death. The US-based group said it had located and interviewed 33 relatives and friends of 27 victims whose cases researchers verified; 37 former detainees who saw people die in detention; and four defectors who worked in Syrian government detention centres or the military hospitals where most of the photographs were taken. Syria torture report In pictures: Syria accused of torture Using satellite imagery and geolocation techniques, HRW confirmed that some of the photographs of the dead were taken in the courtyard of the 601 Military Hospital in Mezzeh, a western suburb of the capital Damascus. The group also identified a coding system for the cards placed on the bodies. "We have meticulously verified dozens of stories, and we are confident the Caesar photographs present authentic - and damning - evidence of crimes against humanity in Syria," said Nadim Houry, HRW's deputy Middle East director. HRW said its report focused on 28,707 of the 53,275 photos smuggled out of Syria by Caesar that, based on all available information, showed the bodies of at least 6,786 people who died in detention or after being transferred from detention to a military hospital. The remaining photographs are of attack sites or of bodies identified by name as of government soldiers, other combatants, or civilians killed in attacks, explosions or assassination attempts. Most of the victims were detained by just five intelligence agency branches in Damascus, and their bodies were sent to at least two military hospitals in Damascus between May 2011, when Caesar began copying files and smuggling them out of his workplace, and August 2013, when he fled Syria, HRW said. Forensic pathologists from Physicians for Human Rights analysed a subset of the photos, and found evidence of several types of torture, starvation, suffocation, violent blunt force trauma, and in one case, a gunshot wound to the head. Among the 27 victims identified by HRW - all of whose families spent months or years searching for news of their whereabouts, in many cases paying huge sums to contacts and middlemen - were Rehab al-Allawi, a boy who was 14 at the time of his arrest for having an anti-Assad song on his phone, and student Rehab al-Allawi, who was 25 when she was detained while working with an activist group. The former detainees, held in the same places as most of the victims, told HRW that guards kept them in severely overcrowded cells with very little air circulation, gave them so little food that they grew weak, and often denied them the opportunity to wash. Skin diseases and other infectious diseases proliferated, and the detainees said guards denied them adequate medical care. "Many of the former detainees who were held in these nightmarish conditions told us they often wished they would die, rather than continue suffering," Mr Houry said. The Syrian Network for Human Rights, an activist group, has documented the arrest and detention of more than 117,000 people in Syria since the uprising against Mr Assad began in March 2011.	Human Rights Watch says it is confident photos smuggled out of Syria by a defector in 2013 showing 6,786 people who died after detention are authentic.
The 32-year-old scored 25 points on Sunday to pass the milestone in his 10th season with the Cavaliers. He now has twice as many points as Zydrunas Ilgauskas, who is second on the team's all-time list with 10,616. James, who also played for Miami Heat, is eighth on the NBA all-time list with 27,938 career points. Media playback is not supported on this device Elsewhere the Atlanta Hawks needed four periods of over-time to beat New York Knicks 142-139. The game lasted for more than four hours, after the teams were tied after 48 minutes and then played periods of five minutes until there was a winner. Hawk's Paul Millsap played 60 minutes, including 35 consecutive minutes, to finish with 37 points.	LeBron James became the first player to score 20,000 points for the Cleveland Cavaliers when the NBA champions beat Oklahoma Thunder 107-91.
Mr Duncan Smith has warned the government risks dividing society with politically-motivated spending cuts. Mr Cameron is to reject this - and No 10 has rubbished claims of a rift with George Osborne, saying the chancellor still has the PM's full confidence. The disability cuts Mr Duncan Smith quit over will be shelved. Downing Street said the changes to Personal Independence Payments (PIP) announced ahead of Mr Osborne's Budget last week would not go ahead "in their current form". But alternative proposals for saving the Â£4bn earmarked for the savings would not come until the Autumn Statement towards the end of the year. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for Mr Osborne's resignation and Conservative MPs have spoken out against the leadership with Mr Duncan Smith's former ministerial team divided in their responses to his resignation. Treasury minister David Gauke is answering an urgent Commons question from Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell on changes to the Budget - Mr McDonnell had called for the chancellor himself but this appears to have been ignored. This will be followed by a statement from Mr Cameron - ostensibly on last week's EU summit - at which he is expected to restate his commitment to "compassionate Conservatism" and reject Mr Duncan Smith's criticisms of his style of government. Former Tory leader Lord Howard urged MPs to "listen to what the prime minister has to say" and to "calm down". Mr Duncan Smith set out the reasons for his surprise resignation in an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr, in which he said the way Mr Osborne had cut benefits in his Budget at the same time as cutting taxes for the better off was "deeply unfair" and that he had become "semi detached" from government. Ross Hawkins, BBC political correspondent George Osborne: chief tactician and patron, a man whose word makes or wrecks careers. That was the view of many Tory MPs for a very long time. Now, many doubt he will ever be their leader, or even the chancellor much longer. It's not that they think David Cameron is poised to sack him or that he's about to resign, as Labour demand. They simply believe a swift leadership election is highly likely whatever the result of 23 June's EU referendum. If it does come that soon, there will be - one predicts - a "genocide of the Cameroons and Osbornites". A stubbornly enduring deficit, a tax credit U-turn, and the sheer numbers of MPs who have chosen to back a leave vote at the referendum have seen Osborne's authority leak. A weekend of melodrama has - in one Tory MP's view - burst the dam. Read more from Ross Lord Howard played down Mr Duncan Smith's criticisms of government policy - but Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston said they were "very serious". "Today, when David Cameron stands up, he has to reaffirm the message that led many people like myself to join the Conservative Party in the first place when he became leader," she said. "Are we about social justice? Are we about spreading the burden fairly? We need to hear that very clear message today." She suggested pensioner benefits - which the Conservatives pledged to protect in their manifesto - should be cut to make up the shortfall. A number of senior Conservative figures have questioned Mr Osborne's credentials to replace David Cameron as prime minister when he steps down. Former chief whip Andrew Mitchell described Mr Osborne's abortive attempt to reform PIP as a "cock-up". He said Mr Osborne was "not the only candidate" for the party leadership and there were a "large number" of alternatives. Influential backbencher David Davis told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire the Â£4bn welfare savings should be cancelled and suggested Mr Osborne should be moved to another department if he wants to be a successful replacement for David Cameron as prime minister. London Mayor Boris Johnson, seen as Mr Osborne's main rival for the top job, is returning from a skiing holiday and has yet to comment. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said it was understood Mr Cameron had urged Mr Osborne to avoid any major controversy in the Budget so as to avoid fuelling discontent among Tory MPs ahead of the EU referendum. Despite this, our correspondent said, Downing Street insists "the two men remain as close as ever", and have dismissed reports that the prime minister will seek to distance himself from Mr Osborne. Number 10 has stressed that PIP will still have to be reformed in the future as the cost is "unsustainable." Mr Corbyn told the BBC Mr Osborne should be "considering his position". "His Budget simply doesn't add up and it unravelled within hours of him presenting it. This isn't the first time a George Osborne Budget has unravelled," the Labour leader told BBC1's Breakfast programme. "It seems to me we need to look at the very heart of this government, at its incompetence, at the way it puts forward proposals that simply don't add up and expects the most needy in our society to take the hit for them." Who would the disability changes impact?	Prime Minister David Cameron will later attempt to halt the civil war in his party caused by Iain Duncan Smith's resignation from the cabinet.
The Electoral Reform Society attacked both sides of the referendum campaign, saying people felt "ill-informed" by the "dire" debate. The society said the impact of political leaders had been "minimal". It called for a "root and branch" review of the way referendums are run. Recommendations made by the society in its report include having a public body intervene when "misleading" claims are made by campaigns, reviewing broadcasters' role and publishing a "rule book" to govern conduct by campaigns. They also propose that future referendums have a guaranteed six month official campaign, and citizenship education be extended in schools with the voting age reduced to 16. The UK voted to leave the EU on 23 June by 51.9% to 48.1%. The then prime minister David Cameron and the government backed a Remain vote, while the Leave campaign was fronted by ex-mayor of London Boris Johnson, who is now foreign secretary. The Electoral Reform Society, which campaigns for "democratic reform", said its polling showed Mr Cameron and other political "big beasts" had failed to convince the public. When asked about eight prominent politicians, most people said they had had no effect on the way they voted. The only high-profile figures who, according to the poll, persuaded more voters of their position than drove them to vote the other way were Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and US presidential candidate Donald Trump, who backed Brexit. "Above all, what these numbers tell us is that people had by and large lost faith in established political figures as opinion-leaders - except where those figures might be said to be kicking against the establishment," the society said. It said voters had viewed both sides as increasingly negative, and many "simply did not trust" their key claims. These included Remain saying households would be on average Â£4,300 a year worse off outside the EU and Leave claiming an extra Â£350m a week could be spent on the NHS. The government's controversial mail-shot to every household in the UK had "little effect on people's levels of informedness", it said, and towards the end of the campaign nearly half of voters thought politicians were "mostly telling lies". The society said the EU debate was in "stark contrast" to the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, which it said had featured a "vibrant, well-informed, grassroots conversation that left a lasting legacy of on-going public participation in politics and public life". The society's chief executive Katie Ghose said: "This report shows without a shadow of a doubt just how dire the EU referendum debate really was. "There were glaring democratic deficiencies in the run-up to the vote, with the public feeling totally ill-informed. Both sides were viewed as highly negative by voters, while the top-down, personality-based nature of the debate failed to address major policies and issues, leaving the public in the dark." On the plus side, the society said it had heard "time and again" from people who felt the referendum was the first time their vote "had truly counted". But it said there were "serious questions" to be asked about the place of referendums in politics, including how they sit alongside the parliamentary system and how to ensure a "high quality" debate. Ms Ghose added: "Now that the dust is starting to settle after the EU referendum, we need a complete rethink about the role of referendums in the UK. They are becoming more common, but the piecemeal nature of the how, when and why they're done means we could simply end up jumping from referendum to referendum at the whim of politicians." BMG Research polled over 1,000 UK-based adults every month from February until the end of the campaign for the Electoral Reform Society's report. The Cabinet Office said: "The British people spoke decisively at the referendum, with one of the highest turnouts of any vote seen in a UK-wide poll in a generation. "They voted to leave the European Union - and this government will deliver on the people's verdict."	The EU referendum campaign was dogged by "glaring democratic deficiencies" with voters turned off by big name politicians and negative campaigning, a report says.
Arthur Cory, 49, said the flag had been kept in a cupboard at Penllyn Castle near Cowbridge, since he was a boy. The flag, one of only three surviving from the battle, is expected to fetch up to Â£50,000 at auction. It is said to have flown above Nelson's warship HMS Leviathan. The flag's "most probable" route to Penllyn Castle was through Mr Cory's ancestor Nicholas Cory, a rear admiral on William IV's Royal George yacht, the auction house said. Roland Elworthy, senior valuer at Holt's Auctioneers, said he had "no doubt as to the flag's provenance".	A man from the Vale of Glamorgan is selling a rare union jack flag, said to have been flown at the Battle of Trafalgar.
Wigan followed up Warrington's win over Brisbane to secure a first World Club Series victory for the northern hemisphere over Australia's NRL. Wane told BBC Radio 5 live sports extra: "One thing we're good at in this country is looking for negatives. "Let's be positive. Let's give Super League a pat on the back." National Rugby League clubs had won all six matches since the expanded World Club Series came into effect in 2015. Wane, whose side became the first from England to be crowned world champions since Leeds in 2012, added: "Tony Smith did a great job with Warrington and we won fair and square. "It's a fantastic feeling and I'm so pleased. The staff work hard but the players do their business out on the park. "We did too much defending. I'm trying to stay positive and not think about how we played. I'm just glad to get the win." Wigan had lost to Brisbane in each of the past two seasons and lost their last World Club Challenge fixture to Sydney Roosters in Australia in 2014. But a hat-trick of tries from Joe Burgess against NRL champions Cronulla helped to add the 2017 title to those won by the Cherry and Whites in 1987, 1991 and 1994. Warrington made their second appearance in the World Club Series, having lost to St George Illawarra in 2015, and ended an eight-match losing streak for Super League clubs against their NRL counterparts with their win over the Broncos on Saturday. "We realise it's big," said Wolves coach Smith. "We knew that we were responsible for some of the credibility over here. They've shown that this is a good part of the world to play rugby league and we can play some pretty decent stuff. "We want Super League to get stronger, but we also want to develop this concept as well. It would be great to go over and play the Broncos at their place. "We're grateful they've come over here and given us the opportunity, and given our supporters the chance to see an iconic club play rugby league, and at the same time promote our sport worldwide." Many observers had concerns about the long-term future of the World Club Series because of the NRL's dominance in its first two years, but the Rugby Football League say discussions are ongoing about the make-up of the 2018 competition. A change of location and a return to the previous format of one match between the two competitions' respective champions have been suggested as alternatives. RFL chief executive Nigel Wood said: "These two games have shown that the annual series between NRL and Super League clubs can be competitive. "We are already in detailed discussion with our colleagues from the NRL about the format and potential locations for the 2018 World Club Series, and these discussions will advance over the coming weeks as we review the 2017 series. "What is clear is that competitive international club rugby can showcase the very best in our sport to the world."	Wigan head coach Shaun Wane revelled in an excellent weekend for Super League after the Warriors beat Cronulla 22-6 to win the World Club Challenge.
Members of the Clwyd North Division are against the changes at Glan Clwyd Hospital, Bodelwyddan. These could see clinical staff transferred to Ysbyty Gwynedd and Wrexham Maelor hospitals from 6 April. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said it was "disappointed" by the vote. Doctors, who held the vote after discussing the plans at a meeting on Monday, said the recent decision to withdraw consultant-led obstetric and gynaecology services at the hospital for 18 months has left them feeling demeaned. Dr Richard Lewis, secretary of the Welsh British Medical Association, said that following a number of high-profile resignations at the board two years ago after a damning report on management failings, communications between the board and the wards remained poor. "The situation in terms of the board's ability to communicate with its frontline staff are as bad if not worse than ever," he told BBC Wales. "That gap seems not be closing; in fact on this particular issue it seems to be widening, which is a real worry." Health board executive medical director Prof Matthew Makin said: "We fully acknowledge the strength of feeling regarding the board's decision from our clinicians but maintain that our primary motivation for making this pre-emptive urgent interim change is to protect the safety of mothers and babies." Meanwhile, AMs in the Welsh assembly agreed a motion on Wednesday calling on the health board to "ensure the continuity of consultant-led maternity and other women's clinical services at each of the three district general hospitals in north Wales". Conservative health spokesman Darren Millar, AM for Clwyd West, said: "I welcome the fact that not a single Assembly Member voted against our motion to protect maternity services from the threat of downgrading."	Doctors unhappy at proposals to close consultant-led obstetrics and gynaecology services at a north Wales hospital have passed a vote of no confidence in the health board.
The Vikings led the table after winning six of their first seven games but slipped from the top after losing to Warrington on 25 March. Betts' side currently lie in fifth place in the table and face league leaders Warrington again on Friday. "I don't see our form being that bad, we've just lost some games," Betts told BBC Radio Merseyside. "We've lost some momentum to look at the table, but internally we're still doing some good things." After conceding 108 points in their opening seven matches, Widnes' fortunes have changed of late, with the Vikings conceding 103 points in their last four games. "It's about doing the little things well, keeping the confidence high and doing the things we did at the beginning of the year with the same kind of determination," he added. "We know we've got to get moving back in the league but Warrington are saying the same thing and there are guys who are fighting to get some momentum in their league positions."	Head coach Denis Betts is not worried about Widnes' recent form despite four consecutive Super League defeats.
The tortoise, known as Speed, had been in geriatric decline for some time. Keepers at San Diego Zoo had used acupuncture and hydrotherapy to treat his arthritis and other ailments. Speed had been brought to California in 1933 as part of a programme to preserve the endangered species from the Volcan Cerro Azul island of the Galapagos, off Ecuador. Thirteen Galapagos tortoises remain at the zoo. The group has produced more than 90 offspring which can be found in many other zoos. Many of them have been sired by Speed.	A giant Galapagos tortoise more than 150 years old has been put down at a zoo in California.
Meanwhile, the big four of Djokovic, Federer, Nadal and Murray show no signs yet of retiring, while others such as Wawrinka, Berdych, and Nishikori also provide competition and excitement for fans and backers of the sport. So it may come as something of a surprise to learn that ATP chief executive Chris Kermode, the man behind the continued upwards trajectory, is about to launch a major review looking ahead to what direction men's tennis should take from 2018 onwards. "We will start the process in 2016, taking a hard look at the long term, and what the ATP stands for," he tells me. "Can we offer a better service to players and tournaments? Can we do better in our marketing and promotion, and use social media and digital better? "We will look at how we connect with our audiences, at our TV coverage, our structure of tournaments. Also how many should be in the calendar, and where they should be based? It will be a major work." He says there are "five tennis stakeholders" to consider - players, tournaments, fans, sponsors and the media. The ATP's review comes after another successful sell-out World Tour Finals at London's O2 Arena, where close to 263,000 fans watched the top eight players compete.  It brought the overall attendance on the 2015 ATP World Tour season to an all-time record of 4.5 million fans (excluding Grand Slams). Mr Kermode says some 15% to 20% of the ATP's annual revenue's annual revenues come from the end of year finals, so as an event it is "financially very important". Now, the finals will stay in London until 2018, beyond the original 2016 deadline. And Mr Kermode says that while other cities offered more money, they did not provide the profile - or "statement for tennis" - he says they currently enjoy at the O2. The 50-year-old also says he has made a conscious effort to present the ATP finals in a different way to other London tournaments, Wimbledon and the Aegon at Queen's (where he used to be tournament director). "We have made it an entertainment event as much as a sports event," says Mr Kermode. World Tour Finals sponsor Barclays will pull out after the end of 2016, as it cuts back its sport sponsorship, but Mr Kermode says the ATP is confident of finding another big backer. "The issue for us at present is whether we go for a two year sponsor deal around London, or a longer deal that is linked to London and another venue somewhere else," says the keen Neil Young music fan. "We are talking to five companies as potential sponsors, and want to be quick in securing a deal." The ATP has been boosted by the fact that in the past six months it has secured deals worth $160m (Â£106m) over the next five years. These include a deal with Emirates, reportedly worth $50m, to replace beer brand Corona as an ATP World Tour sponsor.  The airline's logo will replace those of the Mexican beverage on nets at events. New deals have also been signed with Peugeot, Maui Jim Sunglasses, Indian IT services group Infosys, and Chinese online video business Letv. Infosys has been given the task of crunching numbers and stats for tennis fans, and sports media, in the same way that IBM does at Wimbledon and SAP does for the WTA women's tour. "In the US sports stats are of huge interest, historically less so in Europe," says Mr Kermode. "But many new-generation fans are interested in player statistics, and it is an area we want to focus on. "The more knowledge we acquire about our sport, the more fans want it." With the sponsorship tank nearly full, he says that there is still room to sign other player-focussed deals with firms providing things like medical services and applications, and fitness products. Mr Kermode, who is approaching the last 12 months of his current three year term, says he is keen to stay on for another period in office, but that the final decision lies with the ATP board, not him. One projected development he still wants to get off the ground is an end-of-year finals event for the top eight under-21 players in the world.  Originally envisaged for the 2016 calendar, he now says that deadline may be looking tight. "A final decision has still to be made," he says, but - whenever launched - it is envisaged the event will slot in between the Paris Masters in late October and ATP finals in London in mid-November. As well as giving young players experience of high-level, pressurised, competition in the global spotlight, and thus increasing their ability to compete at the top ends of ATP events and Grand Slams, he also plans to use the event to innovate. One of these proposed changes might be to the player warm-up, he says. "We currently bring the players dramatically on court at the O2, as though they are coming out for a boxing match, which everyone finds very exciting, " he says. "But then you get the player warm up, and things cool off for about 10 minutes. It does not matter if you are in the stadium, there is still that buzz, but it can be bit of a dampener for TV viewers." Meanwhile, he remains sanguine about the day when the "Big Four" male players start retiring. "Genuinely, I am not worried about it all," says Mr Kermode. "It is like when you had the Borg and McEnroe era, then they retired and you had players like Becker, Agassi, and Edberg, coming through." He points to players such as Nishikori ("huge in Asia") , Roanic ("that North American presence"),  and Dimitrov ("still to fulfil his potential"),  as well as youngsters such as Kyrgios and Coric. "There is a great contrast in styles, and good geographical spread," he says.  "Sport is a very simple business model, basically it is about caring about someone winning against someone else, and that will continue."	Men's professional tennis has enjoyed another high-powered year, with record attendances at the Association of Tennis Professionals' (ATP) World Finals in London last month, as well as a number of major new sponsor deals signed.
The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration closed its investigation after it found no evidence of a defect in the vehicle. Joshua Brown was killed when his car collided with a lorry while operating in Autopilot mode. Tesla has stated Autopilot is only designed to assist drivers, who must keep their hands on the wheel. The feature is intended to be used on the motorway, where it lets cars automatically change lanes and react to traffic. The NHTSA report said data from the car showed that "the driver took no braking, steering or other actions to avoid the collision". Bryan Thomas from the NHSTA said the driver should have been able to see the lorry for seven seconds, which "should have been enough time to take some action". The investigation did not find any evidence that the car's systems "did not perform as designed". However, Mr Thomas said there was "industry-wide" concern about the way driver-assistance features were explained and advertised to customers. "These systems require continual and full attention of the driver," he said. "It's not enough to put [information] in the owner's manual and hope drivers are going to read that. "Manufacturers must anticipate how drivers would use the functionality, and that some don't read the manual." He said systems should be designed with the "inattentive driver" in mind. The NHTSA said it would continue to monitor the safety of Autopilot and would take further action if necessary. Mr Thomas warned manufacturers that if safety defects were found in semi-autonomous cars, they would have to be recalled, even if the vehicles were capable of receiving over-the-air software updates. Following the closure of the investigation, Tesla's chief executive Elon Musk tweeted that the report was "very positive".	Tesla will not be ordered to recall its semi-autonomous cars in the US, following a fatal crash in May 2016.
The staff were hired for the launch of the 24-hour Underground service which was was originally scheduled for September. It has been delayed until 2016 due to a dispute over pay and conditions. TfL said it is "operationally ready" for the Night Tube and the extra staff are now working across the network. More on this story and news from London The planned September start date was pushed back until 2016, because TfL and unions were unable to reach an agreement on staffing arrangements. Unions took industrial action during the summer having called for increased pay and a limit on how many all-night shifts their members would be asked to do. Talks at the conciliatory service Acas are due to resume this week. TfL said it is not wasting money as the staff are fully employed. It added 307 are in part-time station positions and the rest work in engineering or service control, adding that some of these staff will be used to replace those that leave or retire. But Val Shawcross, Labour's transport spokeswoman on the London Assembly, said: "It's a huge amount of money that must be blowing their plans. "They've obviously pressed the button too soon in terms of putting them on the payroll."	Transport for London (TfL) has recruited 500 staff for the Night Tube at a cost of £1.5m a month, even though the new service is not yet operating.
The table, published in a report by the Pew Charitable Trusts, showed that US invested more than $48bn (Â£30bn) in the sector, up from $34bn in 2010. China slipped to second place, the authors reported, with investment only increasing by $0.5bn to $45.5bn. Globally, overall financial backing in clean energy technologies hit a record $263bn, up 6.5% from 2010 levels. The report, Who is Winning the Clean Energy Race , showed that G20 nations accounted for 95% of the investment in the sector (which does not include nuclear power). The data, compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, ranked the UK as seventh in the world, with $9.4bn of investment in 2011. Over the course of the year, an additional 83.5 gigawatts (GW) was added to the world's clean energy generation capacity, including almost 30GW of solar and 43GW of wind. "The sector continues to expand and is outpacing growth in the overall (global) economy. The sector reached its trillionth dollar of investment last year," observed Phyllis Cuttino, director of Pew's Clean Energy Program. "We now have 565GW of installed (generation) capacity around the world. That outstrips nuclear installed capacity by 47%. "So I think the facts fly in the face of those individuals who say this is a niche industry. This a growing and maturing sector." (December 2011; source: Pew/Bloomberg) She said market data showed that the US benefited in the short-term from attracting finances, however it was unlikely to be sustained. "Investors rushed in to take advantage of expiring policies, such as tax incentives, loan guarantees, which expired at the end of 2011," Ms Cuttino told BBC News. "So when we look at the very rapid rate of growth in investment here in the US, it is hard to see how that could be maintained without the policy mechanism that spurred that growth." She suggested that there were signs that pointed towards a "drop off" in future clean energy investment as a result of "policy uncertainty". China in previous years, on the other hand, had enjoyed rapid year-on-year growth, but it only recorded a $0.5bn increase during 2011. Ms Cuttino said this was probably a result of the sector within the country maturing. "The thing that is noticeable about China is that they are world leaders in terms of attracting asset finance, which is a measure of job creation and deploying renewables. "This means they are really reaping the rewards of attracting a certain class of investment. "They have a policy that not only attracts investment and deploys renewables, but actually manufacturers and exports as well. Ms Cuttino said that all eyes would be on the Chinese during the coming 12 months because it had increase it target for solar generating capacity from 20GW by 2020 to 50GW by 2020. "So it is going to be a good location for investment, as solar incentives decline in the US and Europe," she added.	The US has regained top spot from China as the biggest investor in clean energy in 2011, according to global rankings.
According to The Times, the flyer offered "free legal support". Leigh Day, which was cleared of wrongdoing over claims against British troops in Iraq, said it had "no prior knowledge" of the poster. At least 80 people died in the blaze on 14 June, leaving hundreds homeless. According to the newspaper, the poster featured British passports and included two personal email addresses for the members of staff. It reportedly read: "Our aim is to help you kick-start any potential insurance claims and review any complex documents. "We do not charge for the assistance we provide. However a third party may charge for their services." The government recently said it would not conduct immigration checks on foreign nationals who survived the fire, as well as those coming forward with information. Leigh Day said it does not represent any survivors of the fire and that an internal investigation is under way. A spokesman for the firm said: "Leigh Day would never have given authority for the posters or their display and we are taking this matter extremely seriously. "As soon as the posters were brought to our attention, a full internal investigation was commenced under formal protocols," he added.	A law firm has suspended two paralegals over allegations they produced a poster offering to "kick-start" insurance claims for those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire in West London.
They were made 110 years ago by the Wall family who lived in New Southgate in North London. There are 24 clear recordings on wax cylinders which were made using a phonograph machine between 1902 and 1917. Music curators say the sound quality of the music recorded is outstanding. The recordings were found at the former home of David Brown, Cromwell Wall's grandson, in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire and donated to St Neot's Museum. It was then discovered that the recordings were made in London. Cromwell Wall's great-great grandchildren, Layla and Zac Jordan, from Sandy in Bedfordshire, heard the recordings for the first time when they visited the Museum of London. Cromwell and Minnie Wall had nine children, eight of whom appear on the recordings. All the recordings are bursting with vibrancy and life, according to Julia Hoffbrand who is the curator at the Museum of London who helped restore the recordings. "When I first heard the recordings the hairs on my arms stood on end," she said. "It was fantastic. We had an idea of what was on the recordings because Cromwell had written very full descriptions on the cylinder boxes but it was really like a window opening into the past. It was like being in the same room as the family and their friends". Many of the recordings were made at family gatherings over Christmas and New Year. Cromwell Wall, who made the recordings, wheeled the phonograph along the streets in his children's pram in order to record the sound of Old Southgate Church bells pealing out New Year. Some of the later recordings were made during WWI when three of the sons, who feature in earlier recordings were away at war. One son, Oliver, died of pneumonia in a French hospital three weeks before peace was declared. The recordings were restored this summer and many of the relatives heard them for the first time in October. It brought back some great memories for Oliver Wall, one of Cromwell's grandchildren. "It was a wonderful atmosphere. I remember the occasions always at Christmas and we always had big parties and singing round the piano with grandpa playing and he used to take us marching upstairs and all over the big house they had." His cousin Daphne reminisces how their grandfather used to dress up as Father Christmas. "There was a great deal of excitement," she said. "It was fun!" It is very unusual for recordings on wax phonograph cylinders to survive for so long. Phonographs were introduced for use in offices as dictating machines and so it is extremely rare for them to be used to record domestic sounds and occasions. "We were thrilled," says Julia Hoffbrand. "Phonographs and cylinders were expensive so you had to have a certain level of income to record and a level of skill and care to make recordings and to take care of the cylinders." The cylinders themselves are similar to old fashioned vinyl records in that the phonograph would make indentations into the cylinder which could then be replayed.  Bill Lowry, digital collections manager at the Museum was among those who helped restore the cylinders. "We tried to reduce any noise by cleaning the cylinder first with a fine brush that can get in between the groove and once we had the best playback from the cylinder we then digitally cleaned them up."

It comes after a bidder to run University Hospital of Hartlepool's fertility services was rejected, despite already running services there. Hartlepool Borough's council asked the area's clinical commissioning group (CCG) to explore with the bidder how it could reach the required standard. But, the CCG said it could not lawfully treat one bidder differently. Care Fertility, which operates 15 clinics across Britain and supports fertility services in Hartlepool, said in January it was "disappointed not to be awarded the contract". The council's audit and governance committee asked the CCG to discuss with the firm how it could reduce risks highlighted in its rejected tender. The CCG said this was not "reasonably practicable". "It is simply not the role of the CCG to guide bidders to make successful tenders," it said. It would be an "unusual and unwelcome" precedent for the CCG to advise bidders and would lead to accusations of unfairness if it did not do the same for all other bidders in the future, it said. It also said re-tendering would take too long, could increase clinical risk and prolong the gap in the delivery of the service and there was "no guarantee that the outcome would be any different". Last year, the council was granted a High Court injunction to stop the unit's closure, after which it was announced an alternative provider would be sought to run fertility services, including IVF. The CCG had said it could not recruit enough staff to keep the unit going.	Health managers planning to close a hospital fertility unit have refused to put the service back out to tender.
2 October 2015 Last updated at 18:13 BST Speaking in an interview with BBC Newsnight's diplomatic and defence editor Mark Urban, he said UK policy in Syria had been hampered by "wishful thinking" - and officials underestimated the staying power of President Bashar al-Assad. More on this story from Mark Urban on BBC Newsnight at 22:30 BST BBC Two on Friday 2 October, and afterwards on iPlayer	Russian's intervention in Syria is "hugely significant" says the UK's former senior military adviser in the Middle East Lt Gen Sir Simon Mayall.
Mike Peters, lead singer of The Alarm, is encouraging US congressmen and senators to 'Get On The List' on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. Three-time cancer survivor Mr Peters co-founded the Love Hope Strength Foundation in 2007 to encourage more people to sign up as potential lifesavers. The US visit follows a similar recruitment drive in Westminster. Ahead of the event, Mr Peters encouraged people in the USA to write to their local representative asking them to attend the donor drive at Capitol Visitor Centre. Potential donors fill out a consent form and have their cheeks swabbed. Their details are then stored anonymously on an international bone marrow registry until they are 61-years-old. It is hoped the event will grow the number of US donors and improve the chances of finding matches for patients suffering from a blood borne cancer or illness. Mr Peters said the foundation has been campaigning for this day for many years. "It is so exciting to feel that all the hard work and effort, made possible with the support of DKMS - We Delete Blood Cancer, and so many others, is finally coming to fruition," he said. "People are realising that one day it could be someone that they know who needs a bone marrow donor, and the more people that are on the list, the better everyone's chances of finding an unrelated donor area." The event in the House of Commons in 2013 registered more than 100 MPs and staff members, and MP John Glen became a lifesaving match a few months later.	A Welsh rock star has taken his bone marrow donor drive to Washington DC.
Reports of a "mass murder" investigation in France and pictures of German policemen carting bags of evidence from his parents' home suggest that officials are determined to find out. But this appears to be a case of murder-suicide, which is very different and extremely rare. In these incidents, one person wishing to end their life takes the lives of others - in this case, complete strangers - at the same time. The statistics show that most murder-suicides happen in domestic settings, and involve a man and his spouse. Murder-suicides involving pilots or in gun massacres are, in fact, much, much rarer. What drives people to these acts is therefore virtually impossible to determine because there is no common theme and the perpetrators don't leave notes explaining their actions. In contrast to the motivations of a suicide bomber, which are intentionally well-publicised, those behind a murder-suicide are usually more difficult to fathom. No-one, of course, can pretend to know what was in Lubitz's mind as he locked the cockpit door and instigated the plane's devastating descent. Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says it's unlikely we will ever know. "It's possible something will emerge, but in most suicides people leave clues or a message. "Incredibly extreme events like this are sometimes just inexplicable." Despite this, the media has been quick to point the finger at Lubitz's history of depression. German newspapers have also reported that he had received psychiatric treatment and may have been experiencing a "personal life crisis". In reality, there is a multitude of factors, feelings and personality traits which could push someone to such an extreme course of action. Alcohol problems, drug misuse, broken relationships or marriages, personality disorders, work stresses - in the past or at the time of the act - can all play a part. Mental health charities agree, and have been queuing up to plead for more understanding about depression, and less sensationalist language. They say the vast majority of people with depression do not hurt anyone, and research shows that their risk is primarily to themselves. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of mental health charity Sane, says: "There are thousands of people with a diagnosis of depression, including pilots, who work, hold positions of high responsibility and who present no danger whatsoever. "We do not know what part depression played in this tragedy but it is a condition that should never be trivialised." Charities said there was a danger that mental health problems could be stigmatised by coverage of the crash, making people more afraid to talk about their experiences. Dr Paul Keedwell, consultant psychiatrist and specialist in mood disorders, also says mental health problems are not a sufficient explanation for what happened. "Among cases of murder-suicide in general, the rate of previously diagnosed depression varies from 40% to 60%, depending on the context." But he does say that of those who are depressed, very few are being treated for it. It is clear that men find it particularly difficult to seek help if they have a history of mental illness. In the UK, for example, 75% of suicides are in men. Lubitz passed the tests set by his employer which indicated he was fit to fly, but it has since come to light that he may have been hiding an illness from them. This illness and his seeming inability to talk about it or come to terms with it may hold some small clue to his actions. But, in reality, there is never going to be an adequate explanation for murder-suicides - particularly for the families of those killed.	The question has been raised - is 27-year-old Andreas Lubitz a mass murderer for bringing down a plane full of passengers, killing everyone on board?
Environment body Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said staff were erecting temporary flood barriers and carrying out other prevention work. An amber "be prepared" warning for persistent rain is in place for Gwynedd, Conwy and Denbighshire. The Met Office said up to 15cm (6ins) of rain could fall in north Wales. A yellow "be ready" warning is also in place for Ceredigion, Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd, Anglesey, Powys and Wrexham. NRW  has issued river flood alerts due to rising levels caused by continuous rain since Friday. It said people should be prepared for flooding and it was monitoring the Dyfi, Elwy, Conwy and Vyrnwy river catchments. Scott Squires, of NRW, said: "Our staff are out working putting measures in place to prepare for flooding. This includes erecting temporary flood barriers to protect areas at risk in St Asaph and Llanrwst."	Work is being carried out to try to prevent flooding in parts of north Wales as heavy rainfall is forecast to continue into Sunday.
The 65-year-old said he was going to "miss it dreadfully" but there always comes a point when things must end. Sir Eric also served as secretary for communities and local government between 2010 and 2015. He is one of several high-profile MPs who are standing down, including George Osborne and Alan Johnson. Prime Minister Theresa May announced on Tuesday she intended to call a snap general election, a move that was backed by MPs the following day. The election will take place on 8 June. Labour MP for Nottingham North Graham Allen also announced on Saturday that he is to step down as an MP, due to ill health. Speaking to the BBC, Sir Eric said: "I think it's always better to leave when people are asking why you're going, rather than why you're staying. "I'd always decided this was going to be my last Parliament having served 25 years and came to the view that it was time Brentwood and Ongar had a new MP." He said he had told Mrs May of his decision, and wrote on Twitter that he would be continuing in his role as the prime minister's special envoy on post-Holocaust issues. Which MPs are quitting - and who might stand? In a letter sent to his local Conservative association, Sir Eric wrote: "It has been an enormous honour to represent the constituency for 25 years; Brentwood and Ongar is a wonderful place to live. "Throughout that quarter of century, I have enjoyed success and some setbacks, but have always been sustained by the friendship back home in the patch." He added that he was grateful for the invitation to serve a further five years but that after "much heart searching" he had concluded it was the "right time for Brentwood and Ongar to have a new representative in Westminster". Sir Eric, who was born in Yorkshire into a Labour-supporting family, joined the Keighley Young Conservatives in 1968, going on to become chairman. He was knighted in 2015. Formerly a Eurosceptic, in 2016 he joined the group of Conservative MPs supporting the campaign to remain in the European Union subject to David Cameron's renegotiations. Sir Eric was responsible for the Localism Act of 2011 that changed the powers of local government in England. The measures effected by the Act include more elected mayors and referendums.	Sir Eric Pickles, the former Conservative Party chairman, has announced he is standing down as Brentwood and Ongar MP after 25 years.
In an interview for June's edition of Empire magazine, Moore recalled his early meetings with 007 film director Guy Hamilton. Moore said that while he would be playing the same character they wanted to avoid "any deliberate" comparisons. The interview, one of a series in Empire on Bond, came ahead of new Bond film Skyfall. Starring Daniel Craig as 007 and directed by Oscar-winner Sam Mendes, the latest movie in the franchise will be released in October. Scenes have been shot in London, Turkey and the White Corries in Glencoe. The filming in the Highlands in February reportedly involved a car chase featuring Aston Martin DB5s - the same car driven by Connery in Goldfinger and Thunderball. Talking about his early discussions with Hamilton about taking over from Scottish actor Connery, Moore said: "We talked about my approach to the character. "The thing he wanted to avoid was any deliberate comparison to Sean, apart from the fact I was playing the same character. "So I was never saying 'Martini, shaken not stirred'." In her interview with Empire, producer Barbara Broccoli recalls how Connery exploded the traditional image of a movie's leading man. Ian Fleming's books about the secret agent were adapted for film by Broccoli's father Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman. She said: "The typical British leading man used to be Trevor Howard or Leslie Howard - very polite and your classic gentleman. "I think the real genius of Cubby and Harry was the fact that they didn't pay any attention to the typical class structure and they took someone who was a very real person and put him into this suit." The magazine tells of "unsung hero" Yat Malmgren, a Swedish dance teacher to whom Connery turned to help hone his movement and gestures. It also tells of Dr No scriptwriter Terence Young introducing Connery to his Savile Row tailors and then telling the actor to sleep in the suits. Empire said the idea was to give the character the look of a man who had an eye for finery, but was more caught up in "life and death than ironing shirts".	Roger Moore has told how one of his first decisions before taking over the role of James Bond was not to use Sean Connery's famous phrase "shaken not stirred".
President Mourad Boudjellal emailed Premiership bosses proposing the move from the Top 14, which a spokesman said they would consider. Boudjellal has made public his frustrations with the Top 14, related to the salary cap and bonus payments. He told French newspaper L'Equipe: "If this is not possible the next season, maybe the one after that." He said he was "serious in my approach" and claimed the move would give the Premiership "huge added value". The Cote d'Azur club have risen up the French leagues under Boudjellal's reign to become multiple European champions. Any switch would require the approval of the French Rugby Federation and the Rugby Football Union, the governing body for rugby union in England, which said it had not been contacted by Boudjellal. Rugby union is familiar with cross-border competitions, with Italian clubs playing in the Pro12 league against Welsh, Irish and Scottish opposition. In the southern hemisphere, the Super Rugby tournament features teams from South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. It will include sides from Argentina and Japan for the 2016 season, which starts in February. However, given the complications of any move, informed observers of the game say it appears unlikely to happen. Top 14 clubs have a larger salary cap than those in England, at 10 million Euros (£7.7m) compared to £5.1m. However, the 12 Premiership clubs will see their cap rise to £6.5m per club for 2016-17 and £7m for 2017-18. The extra money that French clubs are allowed to spend on salaries has enabled them sign some of the game's biggest stars. Among them are World Cup-winning All Blacks Dan Carter (Racing 92), Ma'a Nonu (Toulon) and Conrad Smith (Pau), plus South Africa's 2007 world champion winger Bryan Habana (Toulon). Former England number 10 Jonny Wilkinson, Ireland fly-half Johnny Sexton and New Zealand centre Sonny Bill Williams have also played Top 14 rugby in the past. Toulon have agreed to release Quade Cooper for three rounds of the Sevens World Series as the Australian targets the Rio Olympics. The 27-year-old fly-half will compete in Sydney (6-7 February), Paris (14-15 May) and London (21-22 May). "As a rugby player growing up, you never think you'll have the chance to play at an Olympics," said Cooper. The international, who has won 58 caps for the Wallabies, added: "I'll be doing everything I can to make the squad." For the latest rugby union news follow @bbcrugbyunion on Twitter.	French side Toulon say they want to leave their domestic league to play in the English Premiership.
She quit the role accusing the UK party leadership of treating Scotland like a "branch office". Jack McConnell, who was Labour first minister from 2001 to 2007, said he was "very, very angry". While his predecessor Henry McLeish said Labour faced a problem of "historic, epic proportions". Ms Lamont announced her resignation in an interview with the Daily Record. She said: "Just as the SNP must embrace that devolution is the settled will of the Scottish people, the Labour Party must recognise that the Scottish party has to be autonomous and not just a branch office of a party based in London." Ms Lamont also attacked those who had attempted to undermine her position as she sought to reform the party in Scotland. Mr McLeish, a former Westminster MP who returned to Scotland and led Labour at the Scottish Parliament from 2000 to 2001, said: "Labour in Westminster, Labour in London has not a clue about the realities of Scottish politics. "Joanne has been badly advised. The influences on Ed Miliband have not been helpful." Mr McLeish said Ms Lamont had been unable to lead the party in Scotland amid "constant sniping" from MPs. "It's interesting to know that while we've had devolution of government from Westminster over the last 20 years, we've had no devolution of political power from the Labour Party," he added. Former Scottish Labour leader Jack McConnell tweeted: "This is a truly astonishing development. Johann leaves with head held high. Outrageous treatment of Scottish Labour Party Leader." Lord McConnell later told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme he was "very angry". He said Ms Lamont, who was given more power than previous Scottish Labour leaders when she was elected three years ago, must share some of the blame for failing to set out "a positive vision for the 21st century". Lord McConnell added: "But to undermine her position in this way, when the position of the Scottish Labour Party leader was clarified so clearly three years ago, is in my view entirely the wrong way to go. "I think there are serious questions that need to be asked about what has happened in these past two weeks, but also that this issue has to be resolved in advance of the election of the next leader of the Scottish Labour Party." Lord McConnell said Ms Lamont's move to publicly blame Mr Miliband and "those around him" was a "very serious accusation" that required answers from him and those closest to him.	Two former first ministers of Scotland have hit out at Labour's treatment of Johann Lamont who has resigned from the post of Scottish party leader.
Domenico Scala, who heads up Fifa's Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, is Swiss-Italian - as is Gianni Infantino, one of the five presidential candidates. Scala excused himself from the 2015 elections as he shared nationality with a candidate, Swiss Sepp Blatter. LFA boss Musa Bility says he will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if Scala does not withdraw by Thursday. The battle to replace long-standing president Blatter takes place in 18 days' time. "Article 7.4 of the Electoral Regulations is clear that any member of the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee who has a conflict of interest … is thereby barred from sitting as a member of the Committee and must be replaced," Bility wrote in a letter to Scala on Monday. Ahead of elections in May 2015 between Blatter and Prince Ali of Jordan - both Scala and Claudio Sulser, who was also on the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, stepped aside for this reason. "Prior to the final review process, Domenico Scala (as a dual Swiss/Italian national) and Claudio Sulser (as a Swiss national) withdrew from their positions to avoid any appearance of a potential conflict of interest based on nationality," Fifa wrote at the time. However Andreas Bantel, a spokesman for Scala, says "the fact that a member of the ad-hoc electoral committee has the same nationality as a candidate does not result in a conflict of interest. "There is no such provision whatsoever in the relevant regulations of Fifa," he told BBC Sport. "For the last election period Mr Scala withdrew because the Swiss candidate was the incumbent President. Scala did so in order to avoid even any appearance of a potential conflicted of interest situation and simply as a precautionary measure on a voluntary base. "For this election there are five candidates with no incumbent President. Hence, there is no potential conflict of interest at all." It remains to be seen whether Bility will go ahead with his threat to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In his letter to Scala, he wants to know why the same process has not been followed ahead of the 26 February election. "Following an unprecedented period of sustained turmoil and damage for Fifa as an institution, the fairness and integrity of the current electoral process are absolutely vital for Fifa," Bility wrote. "If we do not receive confirmation from the Fifa Ah-Hoc Electoral Committee within three working days of receipt of this latter that you are stepping down … with immediate effect, the Liberian FA reserves its right to challenge that decision by all available routes." Bility had hoped to participate in the elections himself before being denied by the Electoral Committee in November after failing an eligibility check. On Saturday, the Liberian pledged his vote to Prince Ali while urging his fellow Africans to do the same. Alongside Prince Ali and Infantino, Frenchman Jerome Champagne, Bahrain's Sheikh Salman and South Africa's Tokyo Sexwale are also bidding to replace Blatter as president. The election, which is voted on by Fifa's 209 members, will take place in the organisation's headquarters in the Swiss city Zurich.	The man overseeing Fifa's presidential polls should step aside due to conflict of interest, says the Liberian FA.
Bailey Gwynne died after being stabbed in the heart at Cults Academy in October. His 16-year-old killer - who cannot be named for legal reasons - had denied murder but was convicted of the lesser charge of culpable homicide. He was sentenced by Lady Stacey at the High Court in Edinburgh. He will be supervised for two years after release. The boy was handed an eight-year sentence - and the supervision - for the killing, and another year for weapons offences. He will begin serving his sentence in a young offenders institution because of his age. The judge told him: "If you had not carried a knife, the exchange of insults between you and Bailey Gwynne would have led at worst to a fist fight - and certainly not loss of life." Lady Stacey said the killer had shown "significant regret" and "understanding of the loss you have caused". She said he chose to buy weapons online and take them to school on several occasions which was a "very serious matter". The judge added: "Nothing that I can say, nor any sentence that I impose, will do anything to lessen the grief that Bailey Gwynne's family and friends feel. "The shock of his death at such a young age was felt in the wider community; nothing I can say or do can alleviate that. "I have decided that an extended sentence is the only appropriate disposal, taking into account all of the circumstances including your age. "I hope that will lead to you being both punished and helped towards rehabilitation while you are detained in a structured environment. "Following your release you will be supervised to maximise the chance of your successful re integration into society." Defence counsel Ian Duguid said Bailey Gwynne's killer was an "ordinary, naive teenager" who recognised the gravity of what had happened. He said the teenager was "constantly monitored by psychiatric services", had post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and was medicated for nightmares and depression. The fight began after an argument about a biscuit. A jury at the High Court in Aberdeen took an hour and 40 minutes to find him guilty. Following the verdict, Bailey's mother said the outcome of trial would not bring her "beloved" son back. The youth was also found guilty of two further charges of having a knife and knuckleduster in school. Aberdeen City Council said the case had been "devastating" for the families affected and staff and pupils at Cults Academy. The findings of an independent review into the circumstances surrounding the death of Bailey Gwynne are expected to be published in September. BBC Scotland revealed concerns about the killer were voiced nine years ago when, as a primary pupil, he threw rocks at another child. The incident resulted in the victim being treated for concussion.	A teenager who stabbed a 16-year-old to death in an Aberdeen school has been jailed for nine years.
Stuart Coffey, 44, transferred cash from Bracebridge Heath Medical Practice into his own account between 2008 and 2013. Lincoln Crown Court heard he stole so much money the surgery fell into rent arrears of £37,000. Coffey, of Bede Close, Quarrington, pleaded guilty to one count of fraud. The fraud was discovered when Coffey left the practice and staff discovered the rent had not been paid and other invoices were outstanding. Prosecutor Jonathon Dee said a review of accounts found "pretty much consistently over five years the defendant had been stealing from the practice". The judge, Recorder Stuart Sprawson, said: "This was deliberate. It was clearly planned." Coffey's barrister, Mark Harries, said his client was "ashamed and disgusted with himself". He said he had begun taking the money after struggling to meet mortgage payments. Denise Bluck, the current practice manager at the surgery, said the theft had a "significant impact" on the practice but it was "working hard to deal with the impact".	A former GP practice manager who stole nearly £250,000 from the surgery he managed has been jailed for two years and eight months.
Rizwan Akhtar was promoted from major-general to lieutenant-general to assume the new role and is considered an ally of army chief Gen Raheel Sharif. As head of the paramilitary Rangers force in the southern city of Karachi he launched a major operation against criminal gangs and Taliban militants. He replaces Lt-Gen Zaheerul Islam who is scheduled to retire in October. The BBC's Shahzeb Jillani says the outgoing ISI chief is widely seen to have been at odds with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, with some even accusing him of encouraging recent protests against the government. The military also promoted five other officers to lieutenant general rank to replace outgoing personnel. The appointments are expected to help the latter consolidate his position, our correspondent says. Although Pakistan saw its first democratic civilian transfer of power last year, the country has been ruled by the army for much of its history. The ISI was established in 1948 - as Pakistan engaged India in the first war over Kashmir - and became the primary institution running the intelligence operations of the army, air force and navy. Analysts say that although its precise machinations have remained shadowy, there is little doubt it has played a major role in Pakistan's volatile politics. Rizwan Akhtar's operation to reduce crime levels in Karachi received a lot of publicity but human rights activists also warned of violations. Between 2007 and 2010, he was posted in the South Waziristan tribal region where Pakistan Taliban militants are known to have sheltered. "He is a professional soldier who has experience of both Fata and internal security in Karachi," an army official told the  Dawn newspaper.	Pakistan's army has named a new head of the country's feared  spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).
Taylor already knew he was through before his 7-5 win over Adrian Lewis as Dave Chisnall could only draw against James Wade. Michael van Gerwen will meet Gary Anderson in next Thursday's other last-four match at London's O2 Arena. Van Gerwen topped the table after beating Scotland's Anderson 7-4. Fellow Scot Wright finished second to qualify for his first play-offs with a 7-1 victory over already-eliminated Raymond van Barneveld. Taylor will go in search of his seventh Premier League crown buoyed by a convincing win over reigning champion Van Gerwen in week 14.

Muzaffer Ali, 39, from Maidenhall Road in Luton, Bedfordshire had denied importing prohibited weapons. Judge Jonathan Carroll told St Alban's Crown Court the weapons were to be used for "terrorising, intimidating and causing serious injury and death". Four other men were also jailed for their part in the gun smuggling. The court heard the men brought two shipments into the UK in February and September 2016, unaware they were under police surveillance. Ali sourced the weapons from criminals in Amsterdam while other members of the gang provided security, delivered the firearms and collected money, the jury was told. In May 2016, two gang members were stopped at the UK border at Coquelles in France and a search discovered firearms hidden behind the dashboard. The court was shown evidence from mobile phones, automatic recognition data and police surveillance, gathered in an investigation by the Eastern Region Special Operation Unit. Ali was found guilty of conspiracy to evade the prohibition on the importation of a prohibited weapon and conspiracy to evade the prohibition of the importation of ammunition. He was told he must serve a minimum of 11 years before he can be considered for parole. The judge described him as "a dominating bully" who had never had a legitimate income and had an "utter disregard" for the effects the weapons would have when used by criminals. Ali's three "lieutenants" were found guilty of the same charges. His older brother Khalid Hussain, 49, of Maidenhall Road in Luton was sentenced to 19 years, as was Haroon Khatab, 41, of Jasmine Road in Luton. Sajid Khan, 25, of Manx Close, Luton was sentenced to 18 years. Ali and Khan were also convicted of transferring a prohibited weapon and transferring ammunition. A fourth man, Faisal Mahmood, 20, of Maidenhall Road in Luton pleaded guilty to importing guns and ammunition and was sentenced to seven years and 10 months.	A "dominating bully" who led a gang which smuggled a machine gun, semi-automatic handguns and ammunition into the UK has been jailed for life.
The winning image, by Hadi Asadi from Iran, shows the US president wearing a jacket of dollar bills and with burning yellow hair. Organisers of the Trumpism exhibition in Tehran have held similar contests in the past on themes including the Islamic State group and the Holocaust. This year's logo is based on the Nazi emblem, with a T instead of a swastika. It encouraged many comparisons between the US president and Nazism. "The 'ism' in Trumpism is a reference to racism and Nazism," organiser Masuod Shojai Tabatabaei told the Associated Press. "Many believe his remarks are similar to Hitler. He has had a bad attitude toward media [and] refugees." The group's Holocaust-themed cartoon contest last year drew condemnation from Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu. But organisers said it was designed to highlight Western double standards on free speech rather than cast doubt on the Nazi genocide. Others depictions in this year's competition drew on Mr Trump's promises to build a wall on the US-Mexican border as well as violence against women and attacks on the media. Entrants include several cartoonists from the US and the UK. American Clayton Jones's artwork shows the cover of two copies of Time magazine, one with President Trump's picture and the other with Adolf Hitler. They are both are portrayed as Time's Person of the Year with Mr Trump telling Hitler: "It is a great honor" and in return Hitler replies "Ja."	Hundreds of cartoonists from around the world have taken part in a competition in Iran attacking Donald Trump.
Hibs have started the process of appointing a new boss after thanking Stubbs for doing "a magnificent job" over his two-year spell. Stubbs, 44, decided to return to England shortly after ending Hibs' 114-year wait to win the Scottish Cup. "They fitted in with my ambition," Stubbs said of Rotherham. The Englishman has signed a three-year deal with the Millers, who reached a settlement with Hibs over compensation for Stubbs and his assistant, John Doolan. "Alan and his staff have done a magnificent job, with the pinnacle obviously being that historic Scottish Cup win for which every Hibernian supporter is thankful," said Hibs chief executive Leeann Dempster. "We wish them every success in the future "The task now for Hibernian is to find a head coach who will lead us back into Scotland's top flight by winning the Championship this season. "We expect high calibre candidates, and while we understand there will be a lot of speculation, as ever this club will go about its business quietly and professionally and speak when there is something meaningful to say." Speaking for the first time since his appointment at New York Stadium, Stubbs admitted it was a "really difficult decision" to leave Hibs, but that moving to the Championship in England was "the next chapter" for his career. Rotherham finished one place outside the relegation zone last season but Stubbs believes he can guide the team up the table to match his own ambitions and those of chairman Tony Stewart. "I was impressed by what the chairman had to say, what his vision is for the club and the ambition," he explained. "The club's had two seasons where they've stabilised in the Championship and we're looking to take the club forward. We want to be moving up the table and ultimately we want to be a club that is around the play-offs. That has to be the aim. Media playback is not supported on this device "The plan has always been to be the best I can. I wanted to manage at the very top level. I got a great opportunity at Hibernian, they've been fantastic with me, I really enjoyed my two years there. "I'm glad I've been able to leave on the back of a successful end to the season but now it's a new chapter and one that's very exciting for me." Stewart insisted that, despite lengthy talks with Hibs over compensation - and Stubbs and Doolan ultimately resigning from their posts - relations between the two clubs were fine. And he confirmed that compensation will be paid to the Easter Road club. "Alan had another year on his contract, so we did the protocol with Hibs," Stewart said. "My CEO had discussions with them to talk to Alan and that led to the appointment. We agreed a settlement with Hibs and we move forward now freely. "We've followed Alan's career. He was on the radar months ago, the timing was right and we took the opportunity. I like the drive, the leadership. "Football is about moving around. Hibs have been fantastic, Alan's told me how good they've been up there and it's sad they've lost a manager and Rotherham gained him. We look forward now to getting ready for next season."	Alan Stubbs says leaving Hibernian for Rotherham United was a "calculated risk" but "the right decision at the right time".
Just as the fighting for Mosul moved from east to west over the course of many months, the Iraqi military is now moving westwards towards the Syrian border. Although much smaller in size, Tal Afar has been a so-called Islamic State (IS) stronghold that the jihadist group has used as a strategic "base" since 2014. And Tal Afar has had ruthless rulers before - between late 2004 and early 2006, the city was controlled by al-Qaeda in Iraq, a precursor to IS. Before it fell to IS, the city's population of 200,000 was predominantly ethnic Turkmen, a Turkic people who have their own language and customs. The majority were also Sunni Muslims. Tal Afar's residents are not viewed as helpless victims by many in the region; for a relatively small population, security sources say a disproportionate number of men from the city filled the ranks of IS as commanders, judges and members of their vicious religious police. The battle for Tal Afar could also escalate tensions between Iraq, its ethnic Kurdish minority, Turkey and Syria. Turkey refuses to close or move its military base near Mosul, claiming it could be needed to protect Iraqi Turkmen as well as the Turkish border. The mere idea of Turkish military action on Iraqi soil has been enough to cause many, from Washington to Baghdad, to lose sleep. Kurdish leaders in Irbil are also keeping their eyes wide open as well - juggling the real or perceived threats from Sunni Arab insurgents, Turkish forces and an ever-growing number of Shia Arab militiamen. Tal Afar is a two hour drive from the Turkish border, and the main road from Mosul to Syria runs through the city. It is, in many ways, the perfect location - and the right time - for a perfect storm. The military assault on Tal Afar might seem clear cut, but the combination of forces involved invites complications on the ground. Approximately 40,000 troops are taking part in the fighting - three Iraqi Army divisions, Iraqi and US-led coalition special forces personnel, as well as "government-backed" paramilitary fighters from the Popular Mobilisation (Hashd al-Shaabi). The Popular Mobilisation is an umbrella organisation under whose banner are militias like Kataib Hezbollah (Hezbollah Brigades), Moqtada al-Sadr's Saraya al-Salam - the current incarnation of the Mehdi Army - and the Badr Organisation. The Popular Mobilisation's ranks also include fighters from Asaib Ahl al-Haq, a group trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force that has been accused of a number of kidnappings and attacks in Iraq. The factions in the Popular Mobilisation are predominantly Shia and many are backed and funded by Iran. When you speak to them, many of their fighters do not try to hide their deep-seated disdain for Iraqi's Sunni population. Regardless of fears, internally and internationally, about the size and ultimate intentions of the Popular Mobilisation, it is not going away any time soon. It is needed, many argue. Once Tal Afar has been recaptured, this menagerie of forces will face a tougher operation on a wider scale that could last for months. A case can be made that the number of ground troops available to take part in it will be as important as their weaponry and air support. About 290km (180 miles) south-west of Mosul, IS also holds a string of towns along the Iraqi part of the River Euphrates in Anbar province. These villages are known collectively as "al-Qaim", and they are connected by the Euphrates to the last IS stronghold in Syria - Deir al-Zour province. Deir al-Zour is now the heart of the "caliphate" proclaimed by IS three years ago. Accurate figures are hard to come by, but there are an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 IS fighters on the Iraqi and Syrian sides of the Euphrates valley. Simply pushing the IS extremists over the Syrian border from Iraq will not be enough - and is likely to add to the problem of IS in Syria - but there is little more than inaudible rumblings about how Iraqi forces will maintain security once they have retaken al-Qaim. One solution may be to leave the Popular Mobilisation in the area as a substitute police force, because it has enough manpower and will need a new task, and also because Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has spoken out against disbanding them. In this scenario, Iraqi border security would be handled by forces that are heavily involved with Iran, yet backed by the government in Baghdad - which in turn, is backed by the US government and other powers. Iraqi regular forces, as they work their way back to Baghdad, will have another problem to deal with; a large pocket of IS territory in the middle of the country that has been contained primarily for three years by Kurdish Peshmerga forces. The fight for the city of Hawija may be as deadly as any so far, as it is a cut-off viper's nest. The IS fighters holding it truly have nowhere to run, should they try. The minute the smoke clears from Hawija, the Iraqi military will be looking across the battlefield at the Peshmerga. They distrust each other with equal fervour, and the only thing they have agreed on is need to the defeat IS.	Tal Afar, about 55km (35 miles) to the west of Mosul, was always going to be next on the "to do" list for Iraqi forces.
The Online Hate Crime Hub is made up of five specially trained Met police officers who will try to identify, prevent and investigate online abuse. Sadiq Khan said officers would "work with community experts to develop the police's understanding of online hate". It is the first hub of its kind in the UK and will cost Â£1.7m over two years. It is being funded by the Met and the Mayor's Office for Policing And Crime (MOPAC), with Â£452,000 also being contributed by the Home Office Police Innovation Fund. Any online hate crimes reported to police in the capital, including abuse posted on Twitter and Facebook, will be looked into by the unit. Officers will provide referrals to victim support groups and work with police in relevant boroughs to investigate. City Hall said discussions were also under way with social media companies "to develop appropriate online sanctions for perpetrators of online hate". Victoria Wright, a disability and disfigurement rights campaigner in London, who has been subjected to online abuse, called the hub "a much needed initiative that will make a real difference". "It's vital that those of us who are victims of online hate crime receive a robust response from the police," she said.	A police unit to help tackle online hate crime and provide better support for victims in London has been launched by the capital's mayor.
However, the resolution is non-binding, with Nigeria and Senegal opposing a withdrawal. South Africa and Burundi have already decided to withdraw, accusing the ICC of undermining their sovereignty and unfairly targeting Africans. The ICC denies the allegation, insisting it is pursuing justice for victims of war crimes in Africa. The AU took the decision on Tuesday following a divisive debate at its annual heads of state of summit in Addis Ababa. Part of the resolution also said the AU would hold talks with the UN Security Council to push for the ICC to be reformed. After being discussed in several previous summits, this was a huge announcement showing how frustrated the AU was with the international court. But the debate itself showed how divisive the whole issue is. The resolution isn't as strong as many who are opposed to the court would have liked. It only calls on countries to consider how to implement the decision but does not bind them to it. It's a victory for human rights activists who insist the court still has a very important role to play in the continent where many countries have weak judicial systems. The resolution also calls for African countries to continue pushing for reforms of the court - another clear indication that ditching the court en masse isn't such a popular decision. The likes of South Africa and Kenya, which have pushed for withdrawing, will be disappointed that the discussions about completely severing ties with the ICC will have to wait another six months for the next summit. Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir, who is wanted by the court on charges of genocide in Darfur, was at the summit. In 2015, a South African court criticised President Jacob Zuma's government for failing to arrest Mr Bashir when he attended an AU meeting in the main city, Johannesburg. The government later announced that it was withdrawing from the ICC because it did not want to execute arrest warrants which would lead to "regime change". A total of 34 African states are signatories to the Rome Statute, which set up the ICC. The ICC and global justice: What does the ICC do?	The African Union has called for the mass withdrawal of member states from the International Criminal Court (ICC).
So who are the other six? Carolyn McCall joined the budget airline from Guardian Media Group in 2010.  She was made a Dame in the New Year Honours list this year for her work in the aviation industry. Under her, the company entered the FTSE 100 for the first time. Profits at the airline rose for five years in a row and last September it made a record £681m. This year, however, has been more turbulent, with the company posting a half-year loss of £24m, hurt by the fall in the pound. Veronique Laury was considered a surprise choice to head the home improvement chain when she took over from Ian Cheshire in December 2014. She had been at the business 11 years and led the French DIY chain Castorama. According to an interview in the Financial Times, she has renovated at least two houses and is a keen gardener and painter. Liv Garfield was just 38 when she became chief executive of the water firm Severn Trent in 2014. Before that she was head of BT Openreach, where, according to her online biography, she spearheaded and oversaw the commercial roll-out of fibre broadband to two thirds of the country. Alison Cooper has been head of the Bristol-based cigarette firm Imperial Brands for more than six years, having first joined in 1999. Last year she oversaw a $7.1bn expansion into the US with the purchase of brands including Winston, Maverick, Kool, Salem and e-cigarette brand blu. According to an interview in the Evening Standard, she is a cigar smoker and also a keen singer. Moya Greene was named as chief executive of Royal Mail in 2010 - coming from the top job at Canada Post. She oversaw the company's £3.3bn privatisation in 2013 and has been described as "relentless, a force of nature, a tough lady". She'll need that to help get Royal Mail back on track - earlier this year it reported a 33% fall in annual profits as it faces increasing competition. Alison joined Whitbread - owner of Premier Inns and Costa Coffee - in January this year, having forged her career in banking - most recently at from Lloyds Banking Group, where she was head of their retail division. She told the Daily Mail earlier this year that she stays in Premier Inns when she travels and that "we are definitely short of female CEOs. Clearly there is work to do there".	GSK has just announced Emma Walmsley will be its next chief executive taking the total of women running FTSE 100 companies to seven.
Media playback is not supported on this device Bottom side United's first win in Perth in four years, and Kilmarnock's draw away to Partick Thistle, means the gap between them is down to five points. "It was a wonderful effort. With 10 men, that spirit and character was there again," said the Finn. "I can't praise the boys enough. They've got real mental toughness." Media playback is not supported on this device Ryan Dow had put United into a deserved lead midway through the first half. However, Saints came back into the match and when Coll Donaldson was sent off for denying Chris Kane an obvious goal-scoring opportunity, the visiting fans may have feared another damaging day in their bid to avoid automatic relegation. St Johnstone midfielder Murray Davidson hit the crossbar as the home side pressed for an equaliser but United held firm. "We still have a long way to go but that was a small step towards it," continued Paatelainen. "The mood is positive. Killie will pick up points so we need to be strong. They have a quality manager, they have fantastic players in every department, but days like this will help our chances of survival and that's what we hang on to. "I'm really pleased with everybody's effort." Saints manager Tommy Wright was frustrated at his team's lack of bite in the first quarter of the match. "Up until they scored we didn't compete well enough, didn't make enough tackles, didn't win enough first headers or second headers," he lamented. "I thought we got a slap in the face with the goal and we were much better after that. Probably they've defended well enough overall to win the game. "When you give a team something to hold on to, even with 10 men, it makes it really difficult." Alan Mannus had made two impressive saves prior to the United goal but he will have been disappointed to have allowed Dow's shot past him. "I think in the build-up to the goal we should have done better," said Wright. "We dropped too deep and we should have dealt with the cross better. He got a free contact inside the box. "Because Alan was on the move, it hit the underside of his body and squirmed over the line."	Mixu Paatelainen praised his Dundee United players' resolve as they beat St Johnstone 1-0, despite being reduced to 10 men for the last 30 minutes.
The closure of the tunnel near Linlithgow in West Lothian will mean rail services between Edinburgh and Glasgow will be severely hit. The work is part of a Â£750m upgrade to enable faster, bigger and greener electric trains to run on the line. The disruption will last from 13 June to 27 July. Engineers said the tunnel closure was necessary so tracks could be lowered to create space for overhead power lines for the new trains, which will be introduced at the end of next year. The upgrade is the latest phase of the Scottish government's Edinburgh Glasgow Improvement Programme (EGIP). Train operator ScotRail has a dedicated website to advise on the disruption, which will mainly hit travel between Glasgow - or Stirling/Dunblane - and Edinburgh but it will also have a knock-on effect in areas such as the Fife Circle. Many passengers will have longer journeys or bus replacements. ScotRail advised passengers to add at least 30 minutes to their planned journey times. The closure will mean passengers looking to travel end-to-end from Glasgow to Edinburgh will no longer be able to take a train from Queen Street high level platforms, as the trains will only go as far as Linlithgow. Instead, they will have to switch to the slower Queen Street low level trains or travel on the longer route from Glasgow Central Station. ScotRail said the main routes affected would be: In addition, the following services will be busier than normal in both directions: How will you be affected by the work? Rodger Querns, programme director of EGIP for Network Rail, said the tunnel work over the next six weeks would see the track removed and the floor of the tunnel lowered to create headroom to install new electrification equipment. He said: "We can't avoid the work in Winchburgh tunnel. We do appreciate the inconvenience this will cause passengers. We have planned the work meticulously and are working hard to minimise that disruption. "We are working round-the-clock. We have engineers on the site 24/7 to get the railway back running as planned on 27 July." Phil Verster, managing director of train operator ScotRail Alliance, said: "The EGIP programme is a Â£750m investment in this very important corridor between Edinburgh and Glasgow. "It electrifies the line and the magnificent benefit it brings for our customers is we are going to have longer trains, about 30% more capacity, shorter journeys because we are going to run trains faster and shave about eight to 10 minutes off a 50-minute journey time, and it is going to be greener as well. "So on all counts it is good for customers and good for the country." About 150 years ago when this tunnel was built the challenge was creating enough headroom to allow the funnels of steam locomotives to fit through as they thundered along the track. Today the challenge is about making enough space for the overhead lines for electric trains. The engineers can't go up so they have to go down, dropping the level of the entire track. Some have questioned why the rail improvement work was taking place at the same time as major upgrades to the road network in Central Scotland. Work on the Â£500m M8 M73 M74 Motorway Improvements Project in Lanarkshire is already leading to disruption as traffic restrictions are in force. Transport Minister Derek Mackay advised people to plan their journeys and assured them it would be worth it. He said: "For both the road and rail network the best time to do it would be over the summer. That's when the least people will be travelling. "These are major improvements and they are necessary improvements. We can't just let the infrastructure disintegrate. "This is better than that. It is not just maintenance, it is upgrading of our rail and road infrastructure so it is fit for the future and can unlock even more economic potential and improve the connections in our country." Mr Querns said the EGIP project would continue on sections of the line over the next year but most of the work would be carried out at night. He said: "Next year we will be working in the Queen Street tunnel clearing that for electrification in April 2016." Mr Verster said Glasgow Queen Street would be "transformed" by the changes, with the whole concourse being remodelled. He said: "It will put Glasgow Queen Street on a par with what we have at St Pancras or King's Cross. It is going to be absolutely stunning."	Train passengers in Scotland's central belt face six weeks of disruption from this weekend when work begins on the Winchburgh tunnel.
Ibrahim Halawa, the son of the most senior Muslim cleric in the Republic of Ireland, was arrested during a siege on the Al-Fath mosque in Cairo in 2013. The mass trial of Mr Halawa and 493 others began in March after being postponed five times since his arrest. Mr Halawa, 19, could face the death penalty if he is convicted. Mr Halawa was on a family holiday to his parents' homeland when he and three of his sisters were arrested by Egyptian security forces during a crackdown on protests in the country's capital. He was 17 at the time. His family said he had taken refuge in the building during violent clashes between supporters of ousted president Mohammed Morsi and the security forces. His sisters were allowed to return to Dublin in November 2013. On Wednesday, a hearing in his case took place, with Irish officials in attendance. But it could not proceed as 16 defendants were not present in court, according to the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs. Defence lawyers requested that the trial would not proceed during the forthcoming Ramadan period and the judge agreed to adjourn the matter until 2 August, the department added. Amnesty International Ireland said Mr Halawa should be released immediately with all charges against him dropped. Colm O'Gorman, the human rights organisation's executive director in Ireland, said the situation was "utterly unacceptable". "No one should have to withstand the continual raising of hope that they might have their day in court, only to have that hope continually dashed," he said. "This young man should be at home in Ireland, continuing his studies and getting on with his life." He added: "I urge the Irish government and their EU partners to continue to work on Ibrahim's case as an absolute priority."	The trial of a Dublin teenager held in an Egyptian prison for almost two years has been adjourned for a third time.
Labour called health policy, which is devolved to Welsh ministers, a "real dividing line" between it and the Conservative Party. Labour said it would use funds from a tax on expensive UK homes for 1,000 extra medical staff in the Welsh NHS. But the Conservatives said Wales was the only part of the UK where health spending had been cut. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "Ed Miliband has no plan to grow our economy - that's why he will put the future of our NHS at risk, just as Labour have done in Wales." Labour Welsh government Deputy Health Minister Vaughan Gething said: "The NHS is a real dividing line between Labour and the Tories this May. "With Labour you get additional funding, more frontline staff and a promise that we'll never privatise our health service. "The Tories are staying quiet because they've already begun the privatisation agenda in England, and they know that it's something they can use to tempt Nigel Farage into a post-election deal." Despite being a devolved issue, the NHS has featured prominently in the election campaign so far. Earlier this week, Conservative Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said voters were not interested in whether the service was run from Cardiff or Westminster. Darren Millar, the Conservative shadow health minister in the assembly, said: "Ed Miliband has held Wales up as an example of what he'd do and the facts speak for themselves - longer waiting times for tests and treatment, poorer ambulance service performance and higher hospital death rates. "The truth is that Welsh Conservatives are the only political party consistently voting against cutting the health budget in Wales." Welsh Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate for Cardiff Central, Jenny Willott, said Conservative spending plans would damage vital public services. "The Tories still haven't said where they would find the money the NHS needs, unlike the Lib Dems. With their plans to cut and keeping cutting the budget throughout the next five years, they will have to take the money from other areas, damaging our precious public services. "Unless and until the Conservatives show how they plan to pay for their promises, the Liberal Democrats will remain the only party to make a real, credible commitment to funding the NHS. "The Liberal Democrats are the only party who has committed to giving the NHS the Â£8bn it needs, which means millions of pounds extra for Wales' health service, and we have set out how we will pay for it." Plaid Cymru candidate for Arfon, Hywel Williams, said the Westminster parties had used health as a political football for too long. "This is doing nothing for the morale of hard-working staff and the patients who rely on our Welsh health service," he said. "Plaid Cymru is interested in solutions. We have unveiled detailed, costed proposals to train and recruit an additional 1,000 doctors in Wales, and outlined plans to integrate health and social care to address the growing problem of bed-blocking." Nathan Gill, UKIP's MEP for Wales, said his party believed in "a National Health Service, not an International Health Service, unlike the other parties who seem happy for British taxpayers to pay for the healthcare of anyone who can afford the airfare to Heathrow". He said: "The biggest issue facing the NHS is not a lack of funding, but bad spending decisions. "Between paying GP's salaries up to Â£0.5m, paying thousands of pounds per day to private healthcare providers because of basic staff shortages, and paying six figure salaries to managers, it is no surprise the NHS is in crisis. "Only UKIP is prepared to scrap PFI, cap senior salaries and reduce the numbers of managers."	Clashes have taken place over the NHS between Labour and the Conservatives as general election campaigning continues.
That is in part because of its heritage architecture, but more so because of what is inside - the headquarters of the Tata group, one of India's oldest and biggest conglomerates with more than 100 companies that have interests ranging from tea and telecoms, to salt and steel. In the past decade, it has become one of the UK's biggest employers too. So it is inside Bombay House that the fate of a steel plant, thousands of miles away in Wales, will be decided by the board of the company. When Tata took over Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus in 2007, it was seen as a bold move for an Indian firm, and here in India there was a strong sense of pride over the first signs of a shift of economic power between developing and developed countries. The excitement did not last long though. Falling steel demand post-global financial crisis has meant that Tata's steel operations in Europe, and particularly in the UK, have been suffering heavy losses. It is perhaps been among the biggest challenges facing the group's chairman Cyrus Mistry ever since he took charge in December 2012. Attempts to turn around Tata Steel Europe have included deals to sell some factories and several rounds of restructuring which in this age has come to mean job cuts. While it has had to make those tough decisions, Tata is a company that is very conscious of its public image. In nearly 150 years of operation, it has achieved a position of respect that few other Indian companies have accomplished. It is easily one of the country's most admired companies, one that is seen to care for the welfare of its employees. So even if economics forces its hand, Tata will be wary of the impact on its reputation if it decides to shut down its Port Talbot plant.	Bombay House in the historic Fort area of Mumbai is an iconic building.
Ms Tiffney, 43, was last seen leaving her home in Edinburgh's Dean Village in May 2002. The remains were found by a cyclist in an area off the A198, near the entrance to Gosford House in Longniddry on Sunday evening. A murder charge against Ms Tiffney's son Sean Flynn was found not proven at the High Court in Perth in 2005. Police said her death remained a murder investigation and that detectives would continue to liaise with the Crown Office and procurator fiscal service. Police Scotland said there was no reason to speak to Mr Flynn at this stage. They said the area, about eight metres from the roadside, where Ms Tiffney was found had not been searched before. Det Ch Insp Keith Hardie, of Police Scotland, said: "Now that we have identified these remains, our thoughts are once again with Louise's family, who have had to wait 15 years for this news. "We will continue to provide them with all the necessary support and assistance they may require at this very difficult time. "It is not as bad news for the family as it would have been at the time. "I think they had given up any hope of finding Louise alive so I suppose, to a certain extent, it's good news for them because there is the possibility of bringing this to some form of conclusion." "Our investigation into Louise's death and the discovery of her remains is continuing and we will keep the family and the Crown Office fully updated with the progress of these inquiries." The identity of the remains was confirmed using dental analysis. However, police said they would also seek corroboration through DNA. The force added that Ms Tiffney's remains had now been fully recovered from the site. The A198, which had been closed since the discovery, was reopened on Friday. In June 2002, Mr Flynn was given three years and nine months in a young offenders' institution after admitting causing the deaths of two friends in a car crash. Three years later, he stood trial accused of Ms Tiffney's murder. His trial heard that while waiting to be sentenced over the fatal crash, he and his mother quarrelled at their home. The Crown alleged that he killed her and hid her body. However, a jury at the High Court in Perth returned a verdict of not proven. Mr Flynn expressed his relief, but relatives of Ms Tiffney reacted with fury to the verdict.	Human remains found in East Lothian are those of missing woman Louise Tiffney, police have confirmed.
K Prithika Yashini, who was born male but underwent gender reassignment surgery, applied to become a police sub-inspector in the southern state. But the state police board did not recognise a third gender, leading her to pursue a legal case against it. A court in Chennai (Madras) has now ruled in her favour. "I'm excited," Prithika was quoted as saying by India's NDTV network. "It's a new beginning for the entire transgender community." A ruling by two judges in Chennai's high court said: "The social impact of such recruitment cannot be lost sight of, as it would give strength to the case of transgenders. "Yashini must reach the finish line, and not be stopped and disqualified in the middle." India's supreme court recognised transgender people as a third gender last April, five years after the electoral commission added the category to ballot forms. The ruling meant the government had to provide transgender people with quotas in jobs and education in line with other minorities, as well as key amenities. There are an estimated two million transgender people in India. While the Times of India reports that Tamil Nadu police already have three transgender constables on their books, reports in other Indian media said Prithika will become the first officer in the country. Prithika was born Pradeep Kumar and left her parents' home before completing a computer studies course and undergoing surgery. She had wanted to be a police officer since being a child, Indian media said. The court also ruled that the result of a police physical test, which Prithika failed after being a second late in a 100-metre dash, was not valid.	The Indian state of Tamil Nadu is to hire the country's first transgender police officer after a court cleared hurdles that faced one applicant.
The pair have never met at Flushing Meadows but could face each other in the semi-finals this year. "I'd be happy to play him here - I don't think we are thinking that far ahead," said Federer. Women's world number one Karolina Pliskova, defending champion Angelique Kerber and Britain's Aljaz Bedene are also in action on day two. Czech Pliskova opens play on Arthur Ashe Stadium at 16:00 BST against Poland's Magda Linette, followed by Germany's Kerber against Naomi Osaka of Japan. "When I came here one week ago and I stepped on the site, a lot of great memories came back," said Kerber. "It's a great feeling for sure to be back here at the US Open, for me it's a really special place." Top seed Nadal begins against Serbia's Dusan Lajovic in the third match on Ashe at about 20:00 BST. Find out how to get into tennis in our special guide. Third seed Federer faces American teenager Frances Tiafoe in the second night match at about 02:00 on Tuesday, after American Madison Keys plays Belgian Elise Mertens. "It's good to be number one of the world again, of course," said Nadal, who replaced Andy Murray at the top of the rankings earlier this month. "I think it's a good achievement after three years having some troubles. So I'm just happy for that, excited to start the US Open." Bedene plays Andrey Rublev of Russia in the fourth match on court 11 at approximately 23:00.	Title favourites Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal will begin their US Open campaigns in New York on Tuesday.
Anatoly Kucherena told reporters his client would remain in the transit zone at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, where he has been for the past month. Earlier, airport officials said that Mr Kucherena had given Mr Snowden the travel documents. The US wants him extradited for leaking details of surveillance programmes. Russian President Vladimir Putin has refused to hand him to the American authorities, but said he could stay in Russia only if he stopped leaking US secrets. Mr Snowden, whose passport has been cancelled by the US, has stayed in the airport's transit area since arriving from Hong Kong on 23 June. Who is Edward Snowden? Where will Snowden end up? Q&A: Prism He has requested temporary asylum in Russia, and said recently his favoured final destination was Latin America. Mr Kucherena visited his client at the airport on Wednesday and told a news conference later that the 30-year-old would not yet be leaving the airport. He said the application for temporary asylum had not been processed, and no travel documents had been received. "He is not planning to leave for now. He asked for temporary asylum, which in the case of a positive decision is granted for a term of one year," said Mr Kucherena. The lawyer said Mr Snowden wanted to study Russian culture, adding that he had given the American books including Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment. Mr Kucherena said Mr Snowden was "anxious" about leaving the airport. "I hope that this situation will be resolved in the nearest future," he said. "This is the first time Russia is facing such a situation, and this issue of course requires time for the immigration workers." The lawyer's account contradicted that of airport officials, who earlier told local media that the lawyer had handed Mr Snowden the documents he needed to leave the airport. It was unclear whether there had been last-minute political intervention or some other problem. The Interfax news agency quoted unnamed officials saying the American would be provided with new clothes before leaving the airport. After the lawyer's news conference, the White House said it wanted clarity from Russia on his status. Spokesman Jay Carney said Washington had already made it clear to Moscow that Mr Snowden should be handed over to face espionage charges. The Snowden affair has caused diplomatic ructions around the world, upsetting America's close allies and traditional enemies. Leaks by the former CIA worker have led to revelations that the US National Security Agency (NSA) is collecting Americans' phone records. On Wednesday evening, an attempt to block funding for the programme narrowly failed in a 205-217 vote in the US House of Representatives. The White House had lobbied Congress to support the surveillance. Opponents of the US, including Bolivia, Venezuela and Nicaragua, have all offered Mr Snowden asylum.	Fugitive US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden has not been given Russian travel documents, his lawyer has said, contradicting earlier reports.
The 30-year-old midfielder moved to McDiarmid Park for a second spell in February 2016 after a frustrating five months with Hearts. He has scored 14 goals in 48 appearances since then, having netted twice while on loan in 2015. "The pull of Hibernian was too much for me," said Swanson. "It's always been an ambition of mine to play for the club and I am looking forward to this new challenge and to help achieve their goals back in the Premiership." The Championship winners are yet to reveal details of the contract agreed with the former Dundee United, Peterborough and Coventry City player. Saints offered the midfielder new terms, with Swanson adding: "The decision to leave St Johnstone has been a difficult one for me. I've felt settled at the Saints and really enjoyed my football, and my period at the club has been the most enjoyable and satisfying time of my career. "So, it goes without saying, my decision to leave McDiarmid Park was not taken lightly. "I want to thank the manager, Tommy Wright, who has supported me in so many ways, on and off the field. "His trust in me on the football park allowed me to flourish. The way he treated me like an adult off the park also helped me to mature and develop as a person. "Now that we are in the top six yet again, which is yet another fine achievement, for the next five games it's my focus to make sure I play my part in helping St Johnstone qualify for a European place." Saints are currently fourth in the top flight, five points ahead of Hearts in the race for the final Europa League spot. Asked what Swanson would bring to his Hibs team, head coach Neil Lennon told his club website: "Goals from midfield, hopefully, creativity, "He's had a great season, into double figures. "I think he sees a pass, he's a fit lad, he crosses the ball well. And, whenever I have seen him play for St Johnstone, he has probably been their best player and more likely to create something. "And, allied to that, he is a Leith boy. He gets the club and that's always important as well." Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.	Danny Swanson has confirmed that he is leaving St Johnstone to join Hibernian, saying he could not resist the lure of his boyhood favourites.
The former England captain was appointed until the end of the season in April but failed to pick up a point. Granada will finish bottom of La Liga and Adams said: "This season has been a disaster, we must not make the same mistakes. "The main error has been signings. The owner is aware that he has made many mistakes, but this is a long project." Adams' immediate future is unclear. He has insisted that he will not stay on as coach but has been working at the Spanish club as a consultant since November and is vice-president of the company owned by Granada's club president. Granada scored three goals in his seven-match reign. At the top of the table, Real Madrid are three points ahead of nearest rivals Barcelona. Real travel to 11th-placed Malaga while Barca are at home to ninth-placed Eibar in Sunday's final games of the season. Match ends, Granada CF 1, Espanyol 2.

Pakistan's 42-year-old Test captain Misbah-ul-Haq and 40-year-old batsman Younis Khan complete the list. India captain Virat Kohli, 28, was named leading cricketer in the world, while Australia's Ellyse Perry, 26, was the world's leading women's cricketer. The coveted awards, which began in 1889, are a central feature of the annual Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. Its editor said 2016 was the year Woakes, 28, "announced himself as an international-class all-rounder". They praised the 26 wickets the Warwickshire player took over last summer's four Tests against Pakistan, and the unbeaten 95 he scored in a one-day international against Sri Lanka at Trent Bridge in June. Northamptonshire batsman Duckett, 22, was singled out for his "remarkable" run total of 2,706 across all formats of the game last year. "As much as anyone, he epitomised English cricket's new breed of 360-degree batsmanship," it was added. Roland-Jones, 29, who was called up to England's Test squad for the first time in July, picked up a hat-trick for Middlesex as they secured a first County Championship title in 23 years in September. Wisden editor Lawrence Booth described the feat as "the highlight of the domestic summer". Younis' "classy" 218 in Pakistan's final Test against England at The Oval was "a reminder that his struggles earlier in the series had been a blip rather than part of a decline", Booth wrote. Misbah's celebratory press-ups after an unbeaten century in the first Test at Lord's were described as "one of the motifs of the year". Australia all-rounder Perry "seemed to be operating on another level" over a year in which she averaged 81 with the bat in one-day internationals, taking her record between 2014 and 2016 to 17 half-centuries in 23 innings. And India captain Kohli's double ton in Mumbai confirmed him as "the spiritual successor to Sachin Tendulkar".	English trio Ben Duckett, Chris Woakes and Toby Roland-Jones have been named among Wisden's Cricketers of the Year.
The Northern Irish racer posted a lap of 123.650mph on his Classic Suzuki XR69 - in the best conditions of the week so far. Michael Rutter, Ivan Lintin and Dean Harrison and James Hillier all posted laps in excess of 122mph. Practice will continue on Thursday, with the start of racing on Saturday. Bruce Anstey completed his first practice lap of the week (113.776mph) in the Lightweight class to sit just one second off Ian Lougher's fastest lap. Following a red flag incident at Creg ny Baa and a short delay, Conor Cummins posted the quickest lap of the Classic TT session (107.199mph). Dunlop also topped the Junior Classic timesheets with a lap of 102.082mph. Isle of Man rider Andrew Dudgeon continued to set the pace in Manx Grand Prix qualification, the Ramsey man posting a time of 117.824mph on the GSX-R Suzuki he will ride in both the Junior and Senior MGP races. Fellow Manx rider Michael Evans topped the MGP Newcomers A leaderboard with 112.591mph. Due to a lack of practice time, Manx Grand Prix competitors will have practice on Thursday. In the Newcomers A session three riders - Andrew Cuthbert (Sarah's), Shaun Wynne (Creg Ny Baa) and James Hinchcliffe (Graham's) - were to taken to hospital after separate crashes.

Thousands of signallers, maintenance staff and station workers are due to walk out for 24 hours from 17:00 BST on Monday in a row over pay and jobs. If they do, limited services will run on Scotrail, Gatwick and Heathrow Express lines and Southeastern. And there will be no Virgin West Coast mainline services on Monday or Tuesday. The operator, Virgin Trains, also warned that the East Coast line would be badly affected. Widespread cancellations are also expected to be announced on CrossCountry Trains, Chiltern Railways, Arriva Trains Wales and First Great Western on Monday and Tuesday. Rail companies say further disruption and delays are likely on Wednesday, as services return to normal. If the strike goes ahead, fans of Middlesbrough and Norwich City football clubs may have trouble travelling to Wembley for the Championship play-off final at 15:00 BST on Monday. An outline of how the strike will affect all train companies is expected today, with full details likely on Saturday - but passengers are being advised not to travel unless "absolutely necessary". Talks between Network Rail and union bosses at the conciliation service, Acas, are continuing. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) have rejected a four-year pay deal of a Â£500 increase followed by three years of rises in line with RPI inflation. Virgin said if the strike was called off with enough notice, it would hope to run a "near normal" service. But Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne has advised travellers not to "bank on" the unions calling it off, although he still believes there is "a settlement to be had". He said his team would be available all week and into the weekend if necessary, to reach a deal. People who have already booked tickets should check with their train operator on the special measures in place, he added. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said his team were also prepared to continue negotiations over the weekend. "In the meantime, our picketing arrangements are in place and the response coming back from our members is one of rock-solid support," he added. The RMT has been forced into this dispute through "a wholly-unwarranted attack on safety-critical jobs, pay and working conditions" that undermines passenger safety, he added. Scottish transport minister Derek Mackay said the strike was "very likely to go ahead" and have a "significant impact" on rails and roads. ScotRail Alliance managing director Phil Verster, said the firm was "very disappointed" to have to make so many cancellations but, as it was a UK-wide national strike, "there's very little we can do about it from the Scotland side". He told BBC Radio Scotland 470 Network Rail signallers could strike and he has only 23 contingency signallers so "our capability to step in is very, very limited". Later, the High Court is due to hear a challenge from Network Rail over flaws in the ballot by the TSSA.	More rail companies are cancelling services over the bank holiday weekend, as talks continue to try to avert a planned strike by Network Rail staff.
Homs Governor Talal Barrazi said the evacuation of al-Wair was part of an existing deal with community leaders and would take six to eight weeks. Opposition activists said the rebels would be allowed to depart with their families for rebel-held northern Syria. Al-Wair, home to an estimated 75,000 people, has been under siege by government forces since late 2013. Homs was dubbed the "capital of the revolution" after residents embraced the call to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad in 2011 and drove security forces out of much of the city the following year. That prompted the government to begin a brutal two-year siege that left whole areas destroyed and eventually forced rebels to withdraw from the Old City in 2014. Al-Wair, on the western outskirts, is the last rebel-held district. In December 2015, community leaders agreed a five-stage truce with the government. The first phase led to 300 rebels leaving and the government allowing in a limited amount of food and humanitarian aid. But the deal subsequently stalled. The second phase did not take place until September, when several hundred more rebels were evacuated and the government freed 200 imprisoned al-Wair residents. The next two phases will see about 10,000 to 15,000 people leaving in several groups over the coming weeks, opposition activists from the Homs Media Centre told Reuters news agency. The pro-opposition Orient News website reported that the rebels planned to head to Jarablus, a town near the border with Turkey that was captured from so-called Islamic State last August. In a separate development on Monday, several rebel factions said they were not yet ready to send a delegation to attend talks with the government that are scheduled to begin in Kazakhstan on Tuesday. Ahmed Othman of the Sultan Murad brigade told Reuters that one of the reasons for the boycott was unfulfilled promises relating to a cessation of hostilities agreement brokered by Russia and Turkey at the end of December. Mr Othman complained that Russia, an ally of President Bashar al-Assad, had failed to halt the government's bombardment of rebel-held areas.	Syrian rebel fighters have agreed to leave their last enclave in the city of Homs, government officials say.
Ian Paterson, 59, who appeared at the Court of Appeal via video link, was told his current sentence was "not sufficient" to reflect the seriousness and the totality of his offending. Paterson was found guilty in May at Nottingham Crown Court of 17 counts of wounding with intent. Jurors also convicted him of three further wounding charges. Explaining the decision to increase his jail term, one of the three Appeal Court judges - Lady Justice Hallett - told Paterson his victims had been, "left feeling violated and vulnerable". She described his treatment of patients as "brutal and sustained". "They have lost their trust in others, particularly some in the medical profession," she said. "Some have experienced long-term psychological effects."	A breast surgeon who intentionally wounded his patients has had his 15-year jail term increased to 20 years.
That question is even more pertinent as Labour and Plaid Cymru talk about what they can and cannot agree on. Much of the so called "economic" debate has been about its cost - whether we can afford £1bn, and whether the cheaper Blue Route would be a better option . That is a very different question from whether the Welsh economy would be stronger with it, and weaker without. There is little disagreement that the M4 between Cardiff West services and Magor, east of Newport, is regularly congested. And that slows down the A48M and the A470. There's also little disagreement that the M4 is busiest around Newport, partly because of the unusually large number of junctions which encourages local people use the motorway as a route between the various suburbs of the city. To really understand the problems we need to look at where employment in south east Wales has grown up over the last twenty years. Much of it has been developed on new sites along the motorway. It was part of the old Welsh Development Agency's policy in the late 1980s and early 90s to build big business parks, easily accessible by car. Imperial Park, Celtic Springs, Cleppa Park and Cardiff Gate are all examples of that. Many thousands of commuters travel between the Severn Bridge and at least as far west as Swansea to work for companies on those parks. These developments, and the work they offer, have also been a magnet to people living in the Gwent and Rhymney valleys who may have found it a challenge getting work closer to home. Significantly, the Welsh Government's document arguing for the Black Route clearly shows that the highest concentration of traffic is not at Brynglas but at Tredegar Park, where the main road from the Gwent valleys, the M4, the A48 and a host of industrial parks all meet. The cheaper Blue Route would take westbound traffic off the M4 east of Newport but it is hard to see how it would affect the many thousands who travel south towards the motorway. The big question in terms of easing congestion is how much the Metro integrated road-and-rail transport network will change commuters' patterns. It partly depends on whether the full Metro plans are implemented, how well and how quickly. Importantly, the proposed network does include a station at Cleppa Park - the centre of the family of business parks to the west of Newport - and other stops that may tempt people out of their cars. There is also a station planned for the Royal Gwent Hospital. If we had a public transport system that carried people from where they tend to live to where the work is - and where they want to go for shopping and hospital visits - then would we need a whole new motorway? The economic argument for the M4 Black Route centres on time and money lost due to congestion, the poor image that gives of Wales as a modern place to do businesses, and the theory that concentrations of economic activity tend to multiply more quickly than if businesses are more isolated. Wales' economic weakness centres around having too high a proportion of low-skilled low-value jobs, not enough headquarters, and not enough innovation . Perhaps the biggest question is not about the price of an upgrade of the M4, but what Wales will get from it. It's not really about £1bn or £380m - it's about what we get from that. How much would either route answer the really big challenges of the Welsh economy? Would Wales become home to more research and development, for instance, with speedier travel along the M4?  And would that be the magic factor for encouraging new or growing tech firms to be headquartered here? That's what Wales really needs.	So would the Welsh economy be weaker without the M4 Black Route - or for that matter without any M4 upgrade?
The 14-year-old from Blackpool disappeared on 1 November 2003. Her body has never been found. Karen Downes said she is taking legal action over a 13-year gap in releasing CCTV images of the teenager's last day alive. Lancashire Police has declined to comment. She said the footage that detectives released in 2016, 13 years after she went missing, could have helped solve the case had it been available earlier. "They had [the CCTV] for 13 years," said Mrs Downes. "It shows Charlene in the town that afternoon in the same clothes she disappeared in. "If they'd have shown it before... who knows? "We have suffered all these years not knowing where she is." She said police "need teaching a lesson". "It is not about the money. I want to force the police to do their job," she said. "If I got money I would get something for Charlene like a memorial." Charlene is shown in the CCTV with her sister Rebecca on Bank Hey Street walking towards the Coral Island amusement arcade. She went home but returned to Blackpool town centre later that evening - the last time she was seen. A judge cleared a man of Charlene's murder in 2008 after "grave doubts" were raised about evidence during his second trial. The jury in his first trial failed to reach a verdict. In 2009, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said police evidence-gathering errors contributed to the retrial's collapse. The IPCC found strategic and tactical failure in the management of the material and several officers were disciplined, one forced to resign in 2011. But this resignation order was overturned by a 2012 Police Arbitration Tribunal.	The mother of missing teenager Charlene Downes said she is going to sue police over mishandling her murder case.
The man, known as David, said he wanted answers about how Lincolnshire Police dealt with allegations against Gordon Dawson, a farmer from Spilsby. Mr Dawson shot himself in 2007 after officers informed him of the inquiry. In a statement, Lincolnshire Police said "procedures were correctly followed at the time" but policy has subsequently changed. David claimed Mr Dawson had repeatedly abused him from the age of 15. According to Lincolnshire Police, the first allegation was made in 1999 but no action was taken due to "insufficient evidence". In 2006 police arrested Mr Dawson after four other men came forward claiming they were also abused as children between 1964 and 1986. In early 2007 another alleged victim came forward. An investigating officer phoned Mr Dawson on 23 March 2007 to tell him he would be questioned further and a few hours later he was found dead at his home. Following Mr Dawson's death the investigation was dropped but David later complained to the police about the way the investigation was handled. Speaking on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, David said: "We've had no justice, no finals, no process. "It's been shutdown, shutdown all the way. I just want some answers." Supt Rick Hatton said: "We have revisited the circumstances surrounding the investigation into Mr Dawson and are satisfied that the investigation that took place was thorough and robust, and no misconduct took place. "However, a number of lessons were learned in relation to best practice and fed back to the Public Protection Unit. "We are very sympathetic to the position of the victims in this case and appreciate they may feel that Mr Dawson was not brought to justice." The force said any similar situation today "would see Mr Dawson's guns removed from him as policy is now quite different".	Police have denied mishandling a sexual abuse investigation which left a victim claiming he had been denied justice.
Michael Luciw, 27, from Nottingham, was a passenger in a van that was hit by a Mazda Premacy, being driven the wrong way on the motorway by Albert Kenneth Newman, who also died. Mr Luciw's family said retired people should undergo regular driving tests. Age UK said it was "vital" older people could drive for as long as possible. The family described Mr Luciw, the father of a baby girl, as generous, kind-hearted and a lover of practical jokes. "He had only just turned 27 and he had his whole life ahead of him," said his mum Andrea Shelton. "He was looking forward to his baby's first crawl. Now he will miss all of her life through no fault of his own." "It doesn't feel as if we have lost him - it feels as if he has been taken away from us," said Mr Luciw's brother Simon. "There are so many things that should be put in place so things like this could be avoided. People are driving that shouldn't be on the road. "The older you get, the more your reactions slow down. "There needs to be some sort of test introduced, in a car with a driving instructor, so you get a true reflection of how good a driver you are. "You get a free bus pass once you are in your 60s so people can't say they are going to lose their freedom if they have their licence removed." Mrs Shelton said Mr Luciw, a delivery driver, was on a long-distance journey with a colleague Andy Harrington when the crash happened at 02:00 GMT on 12 October near Kegworth, Leicestershire. Mr Newman's car was heading north on the southbound carriageway. Mr Harrington, who was driving the Ford Transit, said he had not seen Mr Newman's car until the last second. "I managed to swerve slightly towards the crash barrier but there was nothing I could do," he said. "You couldn't even blink that fast. "It lives with me. I still get sleepless nights. It's not something I will ever forget." Mr Harrington, who sustained serious injuries in the crash, said retired drivers should have to undergo medical examinations. "It's up to the government whether they listen to us," he said. "But if that driver hadn't been on the road that morning, Michael would still be here with his daughter." Currently drivers over 70 in the UK must fill in a self-assessment form every three years to renew their licences. The form does not include a medical or driving test. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) which maintains the database of registered drivers said it had no plans to restrict licensing on the basis of age. "Evidence does not show that older drivers are more likely to cause a serious accident than others," it said. "The rules are clear that all drivers over 70 have to renew their licence every three years and have to tell DVLA about any medical conditions which might affect their driving. "If we find evidence a driver does not meet the appropriate medical standard we immediately remove their entitlement to drive." Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK, said: "We know driving often allows older people to have the independence to get out and about, go shopping and attend appointments so it's vital that older people are supported to continue driving safely for as long as possible." For more on this subject watch Inside Out on BBC One East Midlands at 19:30 GMT on Monday 25 January and nationwide for 30 days thereafter on the iPlayer.	The family of a man killed in a crash with an 87-year-old who was travelling the wrong way on the M1 have called for older drivers to be retested.
Guide dog Joey, who mainly flies between London Luton and Paphos in Cyprus, has notched up 35 flights with owner Jan Gibson and her husband Roger. Mrs Gibson, from Swindon, said: "The crew and passengers often fuss over Joey and take photos as it's not often you get to see a dog on a plane." Guide and assistance dogs are the only animals allowed on EasyJet flights. Mrs Gibson, who has had the dog for five years, said: "Joey enjoys flying and will usually sleep at my feet through most of the flight, although he does go for a walk halfway through." EasyJet group director Peter Duffy said: "With 35 flights under his collar, he must be one of the most travelled dogs in the country and we are really  pleased Joey, Jan and Roger have chosen to fly with us again and again."	A golden labrador has been named EasyJet's most frequent flying dog by the budget airline.
In the corner of a busy hospital ward, tucked behind a curtain for our arrival, lies Joshua Davies. His face is alert and he's talkative, but take a look down the bed and you can see both his feet and his left hand in casts. A month ago, Joshua fell from a bridge near his home in Pontypridd, fracturing his spine in four places. The reason for the fall? According to Joshua, it was to get away from bullies. He told Newsbeat: "I can remember speaking on the phone to the ambulance telling them 'I can't move my legs'. "They put me on a spinal board, and that's all I can remember from it." Joshua's family said police had been contacted 15 times about attacks on the teenager, who has Asperger's syndrome. South Wales Police said it had carried out "a thorough investigation" into assault complaints and had arrested and bailed three teenagers. The family claims the teenager has been bullied for the last five years, targeted because of his disability, which is a form of autism. "Josh has never really had an identity as such, he's a good lad, he's a pleaser, he would do anything for anyone," said his mother Cheryl Davies. "Because of the Asperger's Joshua struggles with social cues. "When people confront him, if they're nice to him, Joshua thinks they want to be his friend. Which isn't always the case." "He's slowly getting there, and it is giving him a few setbacks when he has those reality checks, although he's trying to stay positive." During his time in hospital, Joshua has had lots of visitors but said it's still hard to take his mind off what happened. "I've got family to come up and see me and friends, and I've got things to entertain me. "But when I am on my own I'm just thinking 'I am lucky to have survived and carry on with my life'." "I was going to be studying electrical engineering, but if I'm not able to stand up I'm going to have to find another course because I won't be able to use the machinery."

Sheikh Ali Salman told the BBC that for national dialogue to be meaningful, the government had to show its willingness to offer "concrete solutions". "We want someone who can speak for the royal family," he said. Crown Prince Salman al-Khalifa is seen as a reformist in a court divided on how to respond to opposition demands. Hardliners - centred around the unelected Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, who has been in his post since 1971 - are said to be opposed to a dialogue process which has only just been agreed between the government and six opposition societies. They fear that any concessions will only serve to encourage more demands from opposition leaders they deeply distrust. However, speaking to the BBC during a visit to London, Sheikh Salman insisted that now was the time for dialogue. "We welcome it, we are ready for it," he said. "We believe that dialogue and negotiations are necessary." The al-Wefaq leader acknowledged that many young protesters had lost faith in the main opposition parties. "A lot of young people do not believe that we should ask for permission to go on a demonstration, or that we should call for a constitutional monarchy with this family, which until now is still killing people". But he believed that the only way forward was to work with reformists within the Sunni Muslim royal family, including the US- and UK-educated Crown Prince Salman, who has has long been considered a proponent of accommodation with the country's Shia majority. Sheikh Salman noted that hours before King Hamad brought in Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) troops to restore order and crush dissent on 14 March 2011, the crown prince and opposition had agreed a seven-point plan that would have moved Bahrain towards a constitutional monarchy. "We had an agreement with the crown prince," he said. "The seven principles were announced and then 12 hours later, GCC troops came in and severed the dialogue." Asked about the appointment of Senator John Kerry as US secretary of state, Sheikh Salman said he was "hopeful" that he would "do more than his predecessor", Hillary Clinton. "US policy needs to be more clear and direct. The United States government needs to pressure harder for human rights and democratic practices.  We are told that Mr Kerry has more interest in Bahrain and so we hope he will achieve more." On the UK's approach to the crisis in Bahrain, the al-Wefaq leader was more blunt. "If the UK government and [Prime Minister David] Cameron are serious about putting an end to violence and human rights abuses, then they have to speak out publically. "It is not enough to say: 'We are privately urging reform.' That has been done for years. Unfortunately, the Bahrain government is not listening to these private conversations. "So, the question I would ask the British government is: 'Shall you continue to say it privately and not put public pressure?' This is not, I think, a good policy." Sheikh Salman also reiterated al-Wefaq's position that it would continue to call for "peaceful demonstrations", even though all public gatherings and rallies are currently banned in Bahrain. "It is the only way open to us to put pressure on the government." He also called for the release of 13 opposition leaders and human rights activists who have been sentenced to between five years and life in prison on evidence widely accepted as having been obtained under torture. They were convicted of plotting to overthrow the government. "These people have a lot of followers in the street.  If they are not part of the dialogue than the dialogue will fail."	The leader of Bahrain's main opposition group, al-Wefaq, has called for the crown prince to attend talks aimed at ending nearly two years of unrest.
Syd's Garden will be "laced with little clues" about the singer, according to Stephen Pyle. Designed as a restful area for patients and staff, it will open in the grounds of Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge in 2018. Barrett, a founder member of Pink Floyd, died in 2006 after living locally as a semi-recluse. Read more Cambridgeshire stories here The garden has been designed by sculptor Mr Pyle and Paul Herrington, a garden designer. Their charity, Art Garden Health, creates and maintains green spaces for NHS hospitals at no public cost. Addenbrooke's offered them a plot a year ago - and fundraising got under way. Mr Pyle knew Barrett as a young man when the two began Saturday art classes at Cambridge's Homerton College. They were also members of band Those Without, which toured Cambridge youth clubs and pubs between 1963 and 1965. They studied together at the Cambridge School of Art before Barrett left for London - and Mr Pyle began a career in theatre set design. "Syd's sister said he liked roses," said Mr Pyle. "And there'll be a striped colour theme, which fans will recognise. "The artwork on his first solo album is turquoise and orange, and Paul worked with those colours. "There's also a nod to Abbey Road's crossing." The centrepiece will be a circular sculpture, depicting a teenage Barrett on a bicycle, armed with a guitar and a paint palette. "This was the Syd I knew at art school," said Mr Pyle. "The 18-year-old, the free wheeler. "He wasn't ambitious for glory, just very creative and anarchic. He was very charismatic - and very, very talented." He described Barrett as a "celebrated son of Cambridge", who returned to the city and lived as a recluse until his death in 2006. In October 2016 a specially-designed artwork unveiled in the foyer of the Cambridge Corn Exchange in October 2016, where he played his last live gig. A blue plaque was also dedicated to him in Cambridge as part of BBC Music Day 2017.	A childhood friend of Pink Floyd legend Syd Barrett is developing a hospital garden in his honour.
More than 1,000 tombs and 3,000 ancient settlements were also revealed by looking at infra-red images which show up underground buildings. Initial excavations have already confirmed some of the findings, including two suspected pyramids. The work has been pioneered at the University of Alabama at Birmingham by US Egyptologist Dr Sarah Parcak. She says she was amazed at how much she and her team has found. "We were very intensely doing this research for over a year. I could see the data as it was emerging, but for me the "Aha!" moment was when I could step back and look at everything that we'd found and I couldn't believe we could locate so many sites all over Egypt. "To excavate a pyramid is the dream of every archaeologist," she said. The team analysed images from satellites orbiting 700km above the earth, equipped with cameras so powerful they can pin-point objects less than 1m in diameter on the earth's surface. Infra-red imaging was used to highlight different materials under the surface. Ancient Egyptians built their houses and structures out of mud brick, which is much denser than the soil that surrounds it, so the shapes of houses, temples and tombs can be seen. "It just shows us how easy it is to underestimate both the size and scale of past human settlements," says Dr Parcak. And she believes there are more antiquities to be discovered: "These are just the sites [close to] the surface. There are many thousands of additional sites that the Nile has covered over with silt. This is just the beginning of this kind of work." BBC cameras followed Dr Parcak on her "nervous" journey when she travelled to Egypt to see if excavations could back up what her technology could see under the surface. In the BBC documentary Egypt's Lost Cities, they visit an area of Saqqara (Sakkara) where the authorities were not initially interested in her findings. But after being told by Dr Parcak that she had seen two potential pyramids, they made test excavations, and they now believe it is one of the most important archaeological sites in Egypt. But Dr Parcak said the most exciting moment was visiting the excavations at Tanis. "They'd excavated a 3,000-year-old house that the satellite imagery had shown and the outline of the structure matched the satellite imagery almost perfectly. That was real validation of the technology." The Egyptian authorities plan to use the technology to help - among other things - protect the country's antiquities in the future. During the recent revolution, looters accessed some well-known archaeological sites. "We can tell from the imagery a tomb was looted from a particular period of time and we can alert Interpol to watch out for antiquities from that time that may be offered for sale." She also hopes the new technology will help engage young people in science and will be a major help for archaeologists around the world. "It allows us to be more focused and selective in the work we do. Faced with a massive site, you don't know where to start. "It's an important tool to focus where we're excavating. It gives us a much bigger perspective on archaeological sites. We have to think bigger and that's what the satellites allow us to do." "Indiana Jones is old school, we've moved on from Indy. Sorry, Harrison Ford." Egypt's Lost Cities is on BBC One on Monday 30 May at 2030 BST. It will also be shown on the Discovery channel in the US.	Seventeen lost pyramids are among the buildings identified in a new satellite survey of Egypt.
The former Scotland Under-21 international was released by Crystal Palace after he failed to make an appearance during his two years. Kettings, 23, spent three months on loan at National League side Bromley last season, playing 14 times. He is the sixth new signing since Northern Ireland assistant Stephen Robinson was appointed as manager. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.	League One side Oldham Athletic have signed goalkeeper Chris Kettings on a one-year deal.
At the end of Wednesday's trading, the FTSE 100 was down 0.62% or 46.33 points at 7,478.62. Banking stocks were among the top risers, with Lloyds Banking Group up 1.65% and RBS adding 1.35%. Analysts said that struggling Spanish bank Banco Popular's rescue by Santander had given the overall banking sector a boost. On the downside, pharmaceutical companies tumbled. Shire was the biggest faller on the 100-share index, dropping 3.2%. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca lost 1% after its announcement that it had sold the rights for its migraine drug Zomig for $302m. Colin McLean, manager of the UK growth fund at SVM Asset Management, said uncertainty over the outcome of the election so far appeared to be having little impact on investors. "The bigger picture is that international stocks have been doing less well," he said. "Quite a lot of what drove markets last year has gone into reverse over the last six months and investors are looking again at some of the beneficiaries of lower growth and deflation. "That probably drives investors a little bit more than the election," he said. On the currency markets, the pound rose slightly against the dollar, adding 0.33% to $1.2953. It rose 0.61% against the euro to 1.1517 euros.	The FTSE 100 closed slightly lower on the last day of campaigning before the general election.
Bartosz Bialkowski made three good saves to keep Derby out in a first half that the home side dominated. Luke Varney gave Ipswich the lead early in the second half with his side's first real effort when Scott Carson failed to keep out his long-range shot. The result means Derby have still only scored one league goal this season. Derby move out of the bottom three by virtue of goal difference, despite having lost for the third successive match, while Ipswich move up to ninth place. Bialkowski made a great save from Matej Vydra early on before keeping out Craig Bryson's drive from the edge of the box and then stopping James Wilson's effort from long range at the end of the half. Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy made two half-time changes, bringing on Tom Lawrence and Varney, who gave his side the lead eight minutes after his introduction. Former England goalkeeper Carson somehow let the ball creep into the net despite getting two hands to the effort. It was a first goal of the season for Varney, who scored just twice in over two-and-a-half years as a Derby player earlier in his career. Derby tried to break Ipswich's resistance but a combination of brave defending and wasteful finishing - Darren Bent and Will Hughes both missed the target with decent efforts, while Bialkowski made a great save from Nick Blackman in stoppage-time - saw Ipswich come away with the points. Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: "We've mugged them to be fair. They were better than us, they dominated the first half and for 10 minutes we were hanging on. "But it's all about the stuff I preach to the players and sometimes supporters don't like it when I talk about being resilient and tough, hard working and putting a shift in and it gets ridiculed a bit, but without it you get nothing for me. "We've shown all those qualities tonight and we got blocks in and headers out and they were better, they played better than us but they couldn't score." Derby manager Nigel Pearson: "Mick said to me before the game he felt they'd been mugged on Friday and I think they've probably done that to us. "Of course it's a disappointing night and it's difficult to sell the idea that's okay when you are losing games and to score one goal in the league is a poor return, but I thought the players deserved to win the game. "I thought they played exceptionally well. I felt for the fans and the players but the good thing was I think the fans could see what the players are about and they stuck with them."

The defendants allegedly used "unofficial" company credit cards for luxury purchases, unconnected with their duties as board members. Prosecutors say about €12m (£10.4m; $13.5m) was spent on hotels, fine clothes, entertainment and travel. Mr Rato denies wrongdoing. Bankia was rescued in 2012 at huge public expense. The unofficial credit card purchases were not declared to the tax authorities. The system allegedly started at Caja Madrid bank and was continued by Mr Rato when Bankia was created in 2011. How Spanish activists landed ex-IMF chief in court A member of the governing centre-right Popular Party (PP), Mr Rato resigned as head of Bankia shortly before its near-collapse in 2012. The government bailout of Bankia inflicted losses on 200,000 small investors, who held preferential shares in the bank. Some of them voiced their anger outside the Madrid courthouse on Monday. "You wretches! Stealing money from pensioners!" they shouted at the accused as the trial got under way. Prosecutors are seeking four-and-a-half years in jail for Mr Rato and six years for Miguel Blesa, the former president of Caja Madrid, a bank that was merged with six others in 2011 to create Bankia. If found guilty, Mr Rato could also face a €2.7m fine, and Mr Blesa a fine of €9.3m. Mr Rato headed the International Monetary Fund from 2004-2007. He also served as Spanish economy minister, and his fall from grace helped fuel accusations that the Popular Party was riddled with corruption. Prosecutors say the lavish credit card purchases took place from 2003-2012 - some of them during Spain's financial crisis, when millions of citizens suffered hardship and unemployment soared. Mr Rato's two successors at the top of the IMF have also been caught up in high-profile court cases. French Socialist Dominique Strauss-Kahn took over from Mr Rato in 2007 but resigned in May 2011 to defend himself against charges of attempted rape in New York. Prosecutors dropped the charges later that year, then Mr Strauss-Kahn reached an out-of-court settlement with the hotel maid who accused him. In a separate case last year, he was acquitted by a French court of the charge of "aggravated pimping" in connection with sex parties involving prostitutes. Mr Strauss-Kahn's successor at the IMF, Christine Lagarde, is to go on trial in France in December over a state award of €285m in damages to tycoon Bernard Tapie when she was finance minister. She is accused of "negligence", but denies any misconduct.	Former IMF chief Rodrigo Rato and 64 other bankers have gone on trial in Madrid over an alleged credit card racket at Spain's troubled Bankia bank.
Media playback is not supported on this device The 23-year-old is one of six Scots featuring in a 31-strong British Athletics team heading to Belgrade. Muir will be joined in her races by Eilish McColgan, while Olympians Eilidh Doyle and Steph Twell will also feature on the track in Serbia. Also competing will be 800m runner Guy Learmonth and high jumper Allan Smith. Last weekend, Muir shaved a second off Dame Kelly Holmes' British indoor 1,000m mark, also setting a new European record with the second fastest run of all time. That followed her European 3,000m indoor record and the British 5,000m indoor record, after beating Holmes' British outdoor 1500m mark last summer. British Athletics performance director Neil Black is pleased with the "blend" of the team. Scots named in British Athletics team: Men: 800m: Guy Learmonth High Jump: Allan Smith Women: 400m: Eilidh Doyle 1500m: Laura Muir, Eilish McColgan 3000m: Laura Muir, Eilish McColgan, Steph Twell 4x400m: Eilidh Doyle	Laura Muir will bid to become double European Champion next month in the 1500m and 3000m at the European Athletics Indoor Championships.
The Â£21.5m Castle Mill development at Port Meadow, by the River Thames, has been widely criticised as ugly and spoiling the view of Oxford's skyline. The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) will put its case to a High Court judge on 23 October. The five-storey university blocks provide 439 accommodation units. The flats overlook a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. CPRE is seeking the judicial review on the basis of Oxford City Council not carrying out an environmental impact assessment. The council has said the challenge was late as the housing had already been built, and it believed the group's claims were unfounded. Helen Marshall, director of CPRE Oxfordshire, said the West Area Planning Committee "should under no circumstances be rushed into making further poor decisions". "We are not yet convinced that the planning condition on contamination has been met," she added. "And the mitigation proposals currently suggested by the university are woefully inadequate to counteract the devastating impact of the buildings on Port Meadow and Oxford's historic skyline. "A few trees growing to approximately half the height of the buildings in 15 years' time will not meet the brief of 'hiding the buildings in summer and softening their impact in winter' "Key issues such as the height of the buildings and light pollution still need to be addressed." A University of Oxford spokesman said it had "thought carefully" about how best to mitigate the impact of the buildings. "Some measures have already been put in place, and discussions with the city council and others are ongoing about what more we can do," he added. "The University will be making representations at the interim hearing in October on the procedural issues raised by the challenge. "In the meantime, we intend to finish and occupy the buildings by the start of the next academic year in October as planned." The city council said last month it was carrying out an independent review into the case. An online petition against the development on Roger Dudman Way has attracted more than 3,000 signatures.	A campaign group has been granted a hearing to examine the case for a judicial review of the decision to build student flats near a beauty spot.
Sky Mobile will offer flexible monthly payment plans and the ability to roll over unused data each month for up to three years. Sky will become a "quad play" provider, offering broadband, television fixed-line telephone and a mobile service. And existing Sky TV customers will not have to pay for calls or texts and can compile playlists of their favourite shows to watch on their mobiles. According to Sky, some 46,000 have pre-registered for the service. The service comes with three data plans: Non-Sky TV customers can add on unlimited calls and texts for £10 per month, or pay for calls and texts on a pay-as-you-use (PAYU) basis. According to Sky, UK consumers use less than half of the mobile data they buy from mobile network operators, adding up to an annual £2bn of wasted data. Stephen van Rooyen, UK and Ireland Sky chief executive, said:  "We felt it was time to shake up the mobile market and give customers a completely new way to manage their mobile plan. "We've designed it based on what people told us they want - it's easy, flexible and transparent and it puts the customer in control." Ewan Taylor-Gibson, a telecoms expert at uSwitch said: "Sky's first mobile offering is very competitive, as long as you're already a Sky TV customer." He compared Sky's Sim-only deal with that already offered by giffgaff, another service that piggybacks on O2's network and allows customers to alter their package depending on their usage. "The key differences between the two are that Sky ties you in for 12 months, while giffgaff users can cancel anytime, and giffgaff also offers unlimited everything for £20 a month, beating Sky's top package, which delivers 5GB," said Mr Taylor-Gibson. Sky's decision to let people roll over data and store it for three years was "both unique and compelling", he said, but it may have to offer bigger data bundles.	Broadcaster Sky is launching its own mobile phone service.
If, and when, their big day comes, it could be an expensive business covering the cost of hotels, caterers, photographers and florists, not to mention clothes, rings and a honeymoon. Campaigners estimate that the average Australian wedding has a price tag of around 35,000 Australian dollars ($27,000; Â£18,000). "The world's expert body on the economic impact of marriage equality, the Williams Institute at UCLA, says the most conservative estimate for the [potential] wedding spend of Australian same-sex couples is A$161m," says Rodney Croome, the national director of Australian Marriage Equality. "It could be as high as A$600m. "On top of this, Australia's failure to achieve marriage equality is a competitive disadvantage when it comes to attracting those skilled migrants and investors for whom non-discriminatory laws are important." This week the campaign for reform in Australia received some high-profile support from Alan Joyce, the openly gay, Irish-born chief executive of the airline Qantas. He told the Sydney Morning Herald: "I've had people coming up to me in the business community and saying that their son, their daughter is finding it tough (being gay), even in this day and age. "Talking about how important it is for a business leader ... to express our views on things. It is a role model thing." The Flying Kangaroo has a long tradition of equality for its staff. Tim Harcourt, an economist at the University of New South Wales Business School, says Australia's national airline has been a beacon of progressive thinking. "When I worked at Qantas they were always ahead of the game in providing benefits for same-sex partners, whether it be travel or superannuation or so on,"  he tells the BBC. "It has worked out pretty well on the basis that having a happy and egalitarian workforce is good for productivity." Other corporate heavyweights are joining the campaign for same sex marriage in Australia. Telecom giant Telstra Qantas and PricewaterhouseCoopers have signed an open letter urging the conservative government to consider the economic benefits of reform. They have been joined by the nation's biggest banks, ANZ, the Commonwealth and Westpac, along with retailer David Jones. The letter states:  "Not only is marriage equality the only truly fair option, but it's also a sound economic option given that a happy workforce is a productive one. "To remain competitive, and to attract top talent from around the world, organisations - and nations - must create a fair and respectful environment for all." Alex Greenwich, an openly gay member of the New South Wales parliament and a former businessman, who ran a recruitment agency before entering politics, believes that employees who are happy and respected at work are more productive. "There have been so many studies done on the importance of diversity within the workplace and the importance of accepting and treating your staff well in the workplace. "It's kind of a no-brainer," says Mr Greenwich, who believes it is time for Australia to shed its reputation for sexual intolerance. "We know that gay and lesbian people are out and open in very senior levels in a number of corporates across the world, and a lot of them are now saying why do we want to go to a country where we'll be treated as a second-class citizen?" The importance of the so-called 'pink dollar' is felt around in the world where reform has been embraced. But this has done little to soften those opposed to change, who argue that any alterations to Australia's marriage laws would be a backward step. "I think it is disappointing when we have big business trying to influence governments, and for big business to use their clout in this way is intimidating," says Wendy Francis, the Queensland director for the Australian Christian Lobby. "What is good for the economy is stable families and that is what we are really wanting to protect in Australia." Bills to allow gay Australians to marry have been rejected by parliamentarians in the past, and there is currently no legislative timetable for further debate in Canberra. The conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott has deep-seated religious objections, although opinion polls have suggested a majority of voters would be in favour of marriage equality. While there is resistance at a federal level, laws now exist in New South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland, and Victoria, as well as the Australian Capital Territory that legally recognise same-sex unions. Two years ago, New Zealand became the first country in the Asia-Pacific region to legalise same-sex marriages, and the architects of change believe it has had a transformative effect. "All gay and lesbian people that I encounter are holding their heads just a wee bit higher because they know that the law no longer distinguishes between them and our heterosexual counterparts in this area at least," says Kevin Hague, a Green Party MP, who worked on marriage equality campaign. "I know that popular wedding destinations like Queenstown and Rotorua have had a real boom time with same-sex couples from Australia coming over the get married here."	In Australia, at least 18,000 same-sex couples are waiting for the law to change to allow them to get married, according to the University of Queensland.
Rocket Lab's 17m-long (56ft) Electron lifted off from the Mahia Peninsula, in the North Island, the firm said. The test flight was the first launch from New Zealand and is a major first step in an emerging market: launching cheap disposable rockets to carry small satellites and other payloads. The company plans to start frequent commercial launches later this year. Poor weather conditions had pushed the launch into the fourth day of a 10-day window and the Electron finally cleared its pad at 16:20 local time (04:20 GMT). The launch was conducted with no media or spectators permitted, but the company released a video of the lift-off on its Twitter page. "It was a great flight," chief executive Peter Beck said in a statement after the launch, adding though that the rocket did not quite reach orbit, the path on which its future cargo would embark on its revolution of the Earth. "We'll be investigating why, however reaching space in our first test puts us in an incredibly strong position to accelerate the commercial phase of our programme, deliver our customers to orbit and make space open for business." The test launch, one of three planned, did not carry a payload as such, although it was packed with sensor equipment to help engineers understand how the flight performed. Eventually, Rocket Lab says it will be lofting payloads up to 150kg (331lbs) into a 500km-high orbits that go from pole to pole. We're on the cusp of something quite exciting. Innovative companies are packaging really capable technologies into very small, low-cost satellites. Their data will drive myriad new services - from helping city officials keep track of urban development to giving farmers information about the performance of their crops. But if this new wave is to succeed it needs cheaper access to space. At the moment, the economics and flight schedules of these small satellites are still being defined by the availability and price of a ride on a big rocket. Rocket Lab aims to change that. And there others, such as Richard Branson's LauncherOne project. Rocket Lab's second vehicle is already built and set to fly in the next couple months. Keep an eye on the end of the year too because this US/NZ outfit even has a contract to send a small lander to the Moon. Rocket Lab's founder and chief executive Peter Beck is from New Zealand and the firm has a New Zealand subsidiary. The country has less air traffic, compared to say the US, so there is less need for flights to be rerouted every time a rocket is sent to space. New Zealand is also positioned well to get satellites into a north-to-south orbit around Earth. The trajectory takes the rocket out over open water, far from from people and property. The country hopes these favourable factors will help it become a low-cost space hub. Nice touch: The Electron has nine engines on its first stage and one engine on its second stage. They are called Rutherford engines - after the great New Zealand-born physicist Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937), who famously split the atom in 1917. Private and commercial rocket launches are becoming more and more common - the most famous example being Elon Musk and his SpaceX Falcon rockets. But the SpaceX vehicles are huge and are aimed at following in the footsteps of Nasa missions, delivering cargo to the international space station and eventually sending people to Mars. Rocket Lab's goal is to launch what, by comparison, is a tiny rocket for a fraction of the price, but with much more frequency. The Electron is a mere 17m long and 1.2m in diameter. Each launch only costs about $5m. Rocket Lab wants to conduct 50 or more a year. Just to put this all into perspective: SpaceX's current Falcon rocket is a towering 70m and can carry 22,800kg into low-Earth orbit for a standard price of $62m. Rocket Lab's website already allows you to book a slot for your satellite. The cheapest deal is a small cubesat on a rideshare option - prices start at $77,000 (Â£59,280).	An American company has launched a rocket into space from New Zealand, the first from a private launch facility.
Thomas Fendall and Jessica Hussell, who were in a relationship, used their positions within Greater Manchester Police to access restricted material. A court heard they targeted Hussell's ex-boyfriend, who lost his job after he was wrongfully arrested. Fendall was jailed for 19 months and Hussell was sentenced to 16 months. The pair provided false information to the charity Crimestoppers, naming Hussell's former boyfriend as being responsible for a fail-to-stop collision in which another PCSO was injured. Brett Gerrity, senior crown prosecutor for CPS North West, said: "Thomas Fendall and Jessica Hussell, who were in a personal relationship, abused their positions within the police to access restricted material on the police computer system for their own use and to settle a personal grievance. "Fendall used the police computer system to research background information on people he and Hussell knew, and shared information and documents with others. "They provided Crimestoppers with bogus information leading to an innocent man being investigated by the police for attempted murder." He continued: "They also supplied the DVLA with fictitious intelligence, which led to the same man having his driving licence revoked. "He had to prove he was medically fit to drive before his licence could be reinstated two months later." Sergeant Lee Westhead, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "The actions of Fendall and Hussell undermine everything that is at the heart of policing in this country." Hussell, 19, from Glossop, and Fendall, 26, from Denton, each pleaded guilty to misconduct in a public office. They also pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice in relation to providing false information to Crimestoppers. Fendall had pleaded guilty to another count of misconduct in a public office and four counts of computer misuse relating to the GMP intelligence system. The pair were arrested in August 2015 after an investigation by GMP's Serious Collision investigation Unit. They were suspended from GMP upon arrest.	Two police community support officers have been jailed for using force computers to try to frame an innocent man for attempted murder.
In addition to original versions of the games, Halo: The Master Chief collection will also include a new visually-upgraded version of Halo 2. Purchasers of the November release are also being promised "beta" access to the multiplayer version of the forthcoming Halo 5. One company watcher said it illustrated the firm was listening to its fans. "I think it's a smart move," said David Scarborough, from GamesTM magazine. "It shows a willingness to satiate the appetite of Xbox hardcore gamers, which is what Microsoft sees the Halo franchise as - it's biggest hardcore gaming franchise. "It also feeds into the hype for the next entry in the series. "But I personally don't think it will be something that will incentivise people who haven't yet bought a new console to buy an Xbox One." Xbox gamers who already bought the titles on earlier versions of the Xbox are being given an added reason to buy the games again: the package will also include access to watch a new live-action series called Halo: Nightfall. The episodes, produced by Ridley Scott, are currently being filmed in Ireland, and are separate to the Steven Spielberg Halo TV series promised last year. While new pre-rendered trailer footage of Halo 5 was shown to the audience at the firm's E3 press conference in Los Angeles, developer 343 Studios was not yet ready to demo gameplay or confirm a launch date. Xbox chief Phil Spencer told the crowd at the Microsoft event  that Halo was the "reason Xbox is here today". He also acknowledged that his firm had changed its strategy to take account of customer feedback - a nod to it abandoning restrictions on the sale of second-hand disks and releasing a cheaper version of the console without its Kinect voice/camera sensor. He pointedly said at the event's outset that this year's conference would be dedicated exclusively to showing off new games, rather than sharing the time to show off other multimedia features. Microsoft's rival Sony had exploited previous attempts to promote the Xbox as both a games machine and a means to control cable TV, pitching the PlayStation 4 as the machine for serious gamers. That move helped the Japanese company to enjoy stronger sales since both machines launched last November. Other new titles on show for the Xbox One included the hyper-reality game Sunset Overdrive, which features a character who skids across rails blowing up people who have been turned into mutants by a poisonous fizzy drink. The colourful game is an Xbox One exclusive and due out later this year. Microsoft Game Studios showed off another new Xbox One exclusive at an earlier stage of development called Phantom Dust - which is billed as a "battle for reality". It had previously released an action-strategy title by the same name for the original Xbox a decade ago. The in-house games publisher also previewed a dragon-fighting title - developed by Japan's Platinum Games - called Scalebound for the new console, and a fresh version of its open-world third-person shooter Crackdown, originally released for the Xbox 360. One expert said offering such distinctive titles could prove critical to Microsoft's attempts to woo those who had not yet upgraded to a "new-gen" console. "Since Xbox dropped the DRM [digital rights management] stuff before launch and then ditched the Kinect as a must-have about a month ago, the actual level of differentiation between PlayStation 4 and Xbox One has really shrunk," said Ed Barton, an analyst at the Ovum consultancy. "So, one of the only differentiators left is exclusive game titles - there's not much left in to pick between them based on hardware." Analysis from E3: Dave Lee, Los Angeles First stop at this year's E3 was the Galen Center, a venue usually used for basketball, where Microsoft rolled out its portfolio for the coming year and a bit. At its heart, the crowd-pleasing announcement of the Halo Master Collection - a complete compendium of the Halo series, plus a "beta" of the latest entry in the series, Halo 5 Guardians. It won the biggest cheer in the arena, for mostly nostalgia purposes. But a new console can't rely on old franchises, even if they are of Halo's calibre. That's where Sunset Overdrive comes in - an (almost) open-world game with a lead character that, at first glance, is more than slightly irritating. While the Xbox event was a typically loud, brash affair - it was intentionally no-nonsense. This was all about games, and the firm has set out a convincing staple for the year ahead, even if it is a little reliant on tried and tested brands. It all points to a strong 2014 and 2015 for Xbox One. It needs to be if it is to claw back some of the ground lost to the PlayStation 4. Tellingly, there was only a brief mention of the Kinect - a peripheral touted last year to be integral to the Xbox One experience. Not so this time - only two titles mentioned the Kinect directly: a dancing game and a baffling music-creation game based on the old Disney film, Fantasia. Later we get to see what Sony has to offer. Square Enix picked the show to premiere a trailer for its next Lara Croft game, called Rise of the Tomb Raider. The character appears to be suffering post-traumatic stress disorder after her previous origins story, but little of the new plot was revealed. Activision was more forthcoming with a long sequence from its forthcoming Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare game, showing soldiers fighting swarms of drones in a battle-hit city. However, there was only a brief glimpse of its star Kevin Spacey in the footage. Several titles on show took advantage of the Xbox's extra processing power to offer fast-paced multiplayer campaigns. They included:	Microsoft is recoding the main games in its Halo series to run on its recently released Xbox One console.
Greenwood, 22, featured in the 2015 Women's World Cup and is the club's eighth signing of the transfer window. "This is a fantastic move for me and I am really enthusiastic about the new season," she told the club's website. "I had a great year at Notts County but this represents an exciting, new challenge and one that I am really looking forward to." The fee, which is undisclosed, is a club record sale for Notts County who "reluctantly" accepted the offer from Liverpool. "We received a significant bid from Liverpool, which was close to our valuation for the player, and considering her wish to leave we reluctantly accepted the offer," Notts County Ladies chief executive Matthew Alexander said.	Liverpool have signed England defender Alex Greenwood from fellow Women's Super League One side Notts County.
Zachary Barker, nine, died in hospital after the collision in Spring Gardens, Leek, in Staffordshire, last Saturday. His mother Stephanie said she wanted others to "benefit from his short life". She said transplants meant "even in death" he could carry on helping. More updates on this story and others in Staffordshire In a statement released by police, she said: "Zachary was just a lovely lad, full of life and joy. The whole family are devastated by the loss and we cannot believe that we will not see him again. "He will remain in our hearts, thoughts and memories forever. "We took the decision to allow his organs to be used for transplant, so that others may benefit from his short life. "He was a tremendous son who was always willing to help everyone and even in death, he will continue to help others". Police said a friend of the family has set up a Just Giving page to assist with the cost of the funeral.	The mother of a boy who died after being hit by a car says allowing her "tremendous" son's organs to be donated will let him "continue to help others".
The Germany midfielder ran onto a lofted pass from Lucas and, with his back to goal, hooked a volley into the top corner. With Jurgen Klopp's side sitting in third, it could prove to be a valuable goal as they push for Champions League football - but was it the goal of the season? Media playback is not supported on this device "We scored a fantastic goal," Klopp said. "Actually, I would love to see it again - everybody is speaking about it. "I only saw it once but it looked already pretty nice. I turned a little early and didn't see it hit the back of the net. "He is a good boy, a good player and he deserves it," added the German manager. Liverpool have not been strangers to special goals this season - with midfielders Jordan Henderson, Sadio Mane and Georginio Wijnaldum all winning Match of the Day's Goal of the Month competition. With 11 goals in 100 career league starts, Can is not the most frequent goalscorer, and the player admitted himself that his strike at Vicarage Road was his best to date. "I have never scored a goal like that - maybe when I was younger. That is the best goal I've ever scored," Can said. "I saw the space and I ran behind and my first thought was that I wanted to head it, then I didn't think too much." Team-mate Adam Lallana, who made his return from injury as an early substitute, said that Liverpool players will be allowing Can to try more acrobatic efforts in training. "He does like to try speculative efforts, and we will not have a pop now after he produced that," said the England midfielder. "It was a 'worldy' goal, worthy of winning any game. "Credit to him, he was brave enough to try it and it flew into the top corner." The goal of the season will be chosen at the end of the campaign. Tottenham's Dele Alli won the award last season for his strike at Crystal Palace, and the last Liverpool man to win the honour was none other than Steven Gerrard for his brilliant winner in the 2006 FA Cup final.	It was only his seventh Premier League goal since arriving from Germany three years ago, but Emre Can's sensational overhead kick was enough for Liverpool to beat Watford on Monday night.
The ex-Middlesbrough assistant, who held the same post at Hartlepool under Colin Cooper from 2013 to 2014, succeeded Ronnie Moore on Wednesday. Moore parted company with Pools after Tuesday's 2-1 home defeat by Stevenage. "The quality I've seen in training, the intensity and the tempo took me by surprise a bit," Hignett told BBC Tees. "I'm walking into a positive situation. Results and performances haven't been the same, the group of players I've seen today are more than capable of beating teams in this league." Former Tranmere and Rotherham boss Moore helped retain Hartlepool's Football League status last term after his appointment in December 2014. However despite a run of four straight wins at the start of the campaign, form tailed off and Hignett will go into Saturday's home game against Yeovil looking for a first win in five with his side four points above the relegation zone. "First and foremost we need to get away from where we are," he added. "I need to get my message across to the team quickly because there will be a change in style." Liverpudlian Hignett is a self-confessed relaxed and jovial character, but says that will have no impact on his performance with reference to Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp. "Tell Jurgen Klopp that [you have to be serious], there's a time to be serious and a time where you don't have to be," he added. "I do like a laugh and a joke, but when I'm serious I'm serious, there's a time and a place. "Training we have to be serious, match-day ultra serious, but after the game - win lose or draw - I'll be me. "If I want to have a laugh and joke afterwards, as long as the result isn't too bad then I will." Since Hignett's last stint on the Pools' touchline, the club has been taken over by JPNG - led by chairman Gary Coxall - from Ken Hodcroft and IOR Limited. "I was really impressed by what he [Coxall] had to say," Hignett added. "What he wants to do with the club in the future, how he wants to grow the club, his vision, he wanted a clear identity for it - everything I'd want to bring to a football club. "For me it was the perfect fit."	New Hartlepool manager Craig Hignett says the situation at Victoria Park is "positive", despite taking over a side third from bottom in League Two.
Dai Young, boss of Premiership leaders Wasps, expects a number of his in-form players to make the cut. "I'd like to think, the way we've played, we'll have a few in there," Young told BBC Sport. "I know [Jones has] had contact with some of the players on a regular basis - we have got a number in the mix." Jones will also name a trimmed down party of approximately 35 for a training camp in Brighton next week. The final squad before the autumn Tests will be named on 26 October, and with injuries to Wasps' James Haskell and Harlequins' Jack Clifford, England currently have a void at open-side flanker. Northampton's Teimana Harrison started there in England's last match - against Australia in Sydney as Jones' men wrapped up a series whitewash - and is set to be named in Friday's squad. But the Wasps' pair of Guy Thompson and Sam Jones have impressed so far this campaign. "There has been a lot of talk about Guy with his form at the start of the season," added Young. "And everyone knows what a big fan I am of Sam Jones - his work-rate is phenomenal." Hooker Tommy Taylor has been "excellent" according to Young, while Wasps number eight Nathan Hughes is likely to be involved having qualified on residency in the summer. Scrum-halves Joe Simpson and Dan Robson have also both stood out in partnership with fly-half Danny Cipriani. Meanwhile, Leicester flanker Will Evans has been touted as a possible solution to England's number seven conundrum. Evans starred for the Junior World Championship-winning Under-20s in the summer, and followed that by being named in an England training squad in August. It is understood Evans is set be named in the EPS on Friday, but his director of rugby at the Tigers, Richard Cockerill, says the 19-year-old should not yet be thrust into the international arena. "Will is not ready to play international rugby," Cockerill told BBC Sport. "The reality is he has started one game for Leicester, and before that he was playing for Ampthill in National One. "Eddie sees him as a project player and is keen to get the transfer from 20s to the senior group - and his potential is huge. "He is a great young player, who is going to be very, very good. But at the moment but he is not ready yet [for Test rugby]." However, Cockerill feels differently about Mike Williams, the Zimbabwe-born Tigers forward, who is a firm part of Jones' plans, and could even make his England debut come November. "Mike Williams has a little bit more experience," Cockerill said of the 24-year-old. "Given the opportunity he is ready to step up to Test match level today."	England coach Eddie Jones will name his 45-man Elite Player Squad squad ahead of the autumn Tests at 10:00 BST on Friday.
Webb had been linked with the role in 2015, with Blatter suggesting at a conference in the Caribbean on Monday that he could be replaced by Webb "in the near future". But Cayman Islands native Webb said: "No, definitely not. That is not my intention or my objectives at this time." Blatter, who has led Fifa since 1998, was speaking off the cuff before a speech to mark the opening of a Concacaf sport summit. The Swiss was introduced incorrectly to an audience of regional political leaders and confederation delegates as "Fifa's vice-president" by a local media officer. Total number of presidents: 8 Current president: Sepp Blatter, since 1998 Previous president: Joao Havelange from 1974 to 1998 Longest time spent in office: Jules Rimet - 33 years from 1921 to 1954 Number of English presidents: 3 - Daniel Burley Woolfall (1906-1918), Arthur Drewry (1955-1961), Stanley Rous (1961-1974) Blatter, 77, stepped up to the lectern and replied to the mistake by telling the media officer and assembled guests: "I think you're a prophet." He then added that there may be a new Fifa president in "the near future" and the next president "could be Jeffrey Webb". After receiving applause, he added: "This would not mean I would be vice-president. Once you have been a horse you don't go back to the stable." Sources close to Fifa have told BBC Sport that the comments should not be taken as a decision by Blatter that he will not stand as a candidate in the next election, scheduled for May 2015, and that all options are still open to him. Blatter told Uefa delegates in 2011 that this would be his final term of office but has this year given strong indications that he may seek a fresh mandate. The comments are the clearest indication so far that Uefa president Michel Platini - considered by many observers to be his most likely successor - is not the man Blatter wishes to see in power after he has left the role. Platini has yet to decide if he will stand in the 2015 election saying recently that he wanted more time to consider the matter. Webb, 49, was elected president of Concacaf in May 2012 following the acrimonious departures of former president Jack Warner and general secretary Chuck Blazer. Now one of seven Fifa vice-presidents, Webb started his time in football governance as president of the Cayman Islands Football Association in 1991.	Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football leader Jeffrey Webb says he has "no intention" of replacing Sepp Blatter as Fifa president.
Julian Lewis, chairman of the Defence Select Committee, said the former prime minister had "charm and ability". But he had "dangerously" delayed renewing Trident, Mr Lewis said, also questioning Mr Cameron's roles in Libya, Brexit and armed forces cuts. The ex-PM was mooted as Nato secretary-general over the Christmas period. The incumbent, former Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, is due to stand down within the next couple of years. In a speech as part of the Speaker's Lecture series, Mr Lewis said: "During the Christmas recess, an obviously planted story appeared in a tabloid newspaper suggesting that our most recent former prime minister should be the UK's candidate as next Nato secretary-general. "It was duly taken up by the wider media, with heavy hints suggesting that Number 10 was actively considering the proposal." He added: "David Cameron is a man of charm and ability. He deserves to find a role commensurate with his talents, and I am sure that he will. "But those talents do not include wisely judging strategic issues, whether when toppling Arab dictators in places like Libya, increasing military commitments whilst cutting the armed forces, predicting a Third World War in consequence of Brexit, or dangerously delaying the renewal of Trident for the sake of coalition politics - as he did." Mr Cameron resigned as prime minister last summer after his Remain campaign lost the EU referendum. He stood down as MP for Witney, Oxfordshire, in September. In an interview with the Times, published on Monday, US President-elect Donald Trump branded Nato "obsolete" for failing to adapt to the threat posed by terrorism, but he also said the 28-member military alliance was "very important". Mr Lewis warned that if the US turned away from the organisation, Europe would have "little chance" of deterring non-nuclear threats. But he claimed Mr Trump was trying to strengthen the alliance by confronting countries which failed to meet the membership requirement of spending more than 2% of GDP on defence. Mr Lewis said: "It seems to me far more likely that, by confronting the 'free-riders' within the alliance, he actually aims to strengthen Nato by ensuring that all its members properly fund their armed forces in the future."	David Cameron should not become leader of Nato as his "talents do not include wisely-judging strategic issues", a senior Conservative MP has warned.
Arthur Cave, 15, was found with multiple injuries on the underpass of Ovingdean Gap in July. He died later at the Royal Sussex County Hospital. Sussex Police said his death was not suspicious, and the coroner ruled it was "accidental". Nick Cave, 58, is an Australian songwriter and is best known as lead singer of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Mr Cave and his wife Susie Bick are at the hearing which is being held in front of Brighton senior coroner Veronica Hamilton-Deeley at Woodvale Crematorium. The inquest heard Arthur had taken LSD with a friend and he was seen "staggering" on his own before he fell off the cliff. Members of the public tried to resuscitate him after he was found lying on the ground without any shoes or socks on. During evidence given by pathologist Dr Simi George, Ms Hamilton-Deeley asked: "The history you had was that LSD was used?" Dr George replied: "Yes." The cause of death was given as "multiple traumatic injuries due to a fall from a height". Recording a conclusion of accidental death, Ms Hamilton-Deeley, said: "I expect the decision and planning to take LSD, or a hallucinogenic drug likely to be LSD, was made on the spur of the moment. "It's clear he could not know what was real and what was not real. "It's completely impossible to know what was in Arthur's mind and what he was seeing." In a statement issued after the inquest, the Cave family said they had been "overwhelmed" by the messages of support from people "in Brighton and beyond". It read: "Arthur was a wonderfully unruly, creative and free-spirited young man with an infectious, happy, funny daredevil nature. "He loved his friends and family, idolised his twin brother Earl and was never far from his side."	Musician Nick Cave's teenage son took LSD before he fell off a cliff in Brighton, an inquest has heard.
It is the third time Vitalmiro Bastos Moura has been tried for Dorothy Stang's 2005 death after previous convictions were overturned. Ms Stang, 73, campaigned for 30 years to save rainforest from the interests of wealthy landlords. She had tried to block Moura's attempts to seize land and was shot six times. Moura, who was convicted in 2007 and 2010 in verdicts that were subsequently overturned, was sentenced to 30 years in prison. In the latest trial, the judge said Moura had acted in a cold-blooded and cowardly manner. Prosecutors earlier said Moura and another rancher had hired gunmen to kill Ms Stang. Moura's lawyers argued there wasn't enough evidence linking him to the crime. The death of Ms Stang in the northern state of Para became a symbol of the violent conflict for natural resources in Brazil's Amazon region. In the past 30 years, more than 1,000 people have been killed in land disputes in Brazil, with some two-thirds of the murders happening in Para. Ahead of the latest verdict, Ms Stang's sister, Barbara Richardson, said the repeated trials had been upsetting but had helped maintain a spotlight on the issues. "That keeps the injustice of the system before the people's eyes," she told AP. "Dorothy is ever prominent. The people understand what happened to her and what this means."	A Brazilian court has convicted a rancher for ordering the murder of an American nun over a land dispute - a case that caused international outrage.
The Gran Fondo was in the city for the first time, giving riders the option of taking on a 100 mile (160km) course or a shorter 37 mile (60km) route. Plymouth based cyclist Jonathan Tiernan-Locke, who is serving a two-year doping ban, was among the riders. The Sky Ride offered families the chance to cycle a 5 mile (8km) tour of the city.	Thousands of bikers in Devon took to the streets as two big cycling events came to Plymouth.
It goes on. A first Olympic diving gold, a first Olympic gymnastics gold, and then a second, from the same man, a few hours later. Multiple Formula 1 world titles, Lions series won. The first woman in history to win an Olympic boxing gold, the first to retain one too. And now another bequest, from a man who has already provided so much. A British tennis player as world number one is an idea as ludicrous to recent memory as anything else in that giddy list, but with Andy Murray, we should no longer be surprised. To a nation systematically unable to produce tennis champions despite finances and facilities at the elite level to embarrass others as well as itself, Murray is the gift that keeps giving. Only 26 men have held that solitary ranking since the calculations went computerised 43 years ago. It is not a gimmick, or a marketing exercise, or even a reward in itself, but a defining benchmark. You cannot fluke it or get lucky with a judging panel. It is deserved. It is definitive. "Being number one is the pinnacle of all the ambitions of every player," said Novak Djokovic, the man just deposed, when he began his own long reign three years ago. "This is the dream." It hasn't made every player happy. The only certain thing about being world number one is that the day will come when you will no longer be world number one. Andre Agassi has described how miserable it made him, how the achievement seemed to legitimise his father's cruel ambitions and obsessions rather than his own. John McEnroe, who spent a cumulative total of 170 weeks at the top of the pile, found it lonely atop the exposed summit. "You're out there on your own island," he once said. "And you feel like you're disengaged, not only with the rest of the world, but the rest of your competitors, some of them friends." Media playback is not supported on this device Climbing the mountain is often an easier task in sport than defending your splendid isolation. The England rugby union team who won the World Cup in 2003, having gone into that tournament as Grand Slam winners and on an unbeaten home run stretching back 22 games and four years, finished third in the subsequent Six Nations and fourth in the next two. "In a game, thousands of decisions are being made, but it only needs a few to be the wrong ones for the team's fortunes to reverse," says Matt Dawson, scrum-half in that team. "When it goes, it goes quickly." It was the same for the England cricket team who rose to number one in the Test rankings after beating India in the summer of 2011: whitewashed in their next Test series, against Pakistan in the UAE, and then dismantled at home to South Africa the following summer, losing their captain Andrew Strauss and, for a while, their star batsman Kevin Pietersen. Being world number one gets you respect. It also makes you a target. Everyone wants your scalp. Every defeat is automatically a headline. Even your own motivation can begin to slide, if only subconsciously, if only by minute fractions. How to focus on the next target when you can climb no further? Where can you go from the top but down? Murray's character may insulate him from those uncertainties for a while yet. Find out how to get into tennis in our special guide. The 29-year-old's new position reflects both his own remarkable consistency over the past 12 months and the personal and physical problems that have shackled Djokovic, but it is also testament to a desire for self-improvement only occasionally found in sportsmen of his age. Ranked 17th in the world a decade ago, he was gloriously log-jammed at four in those four seasons from 2008 to 2011, the unprecedented trio of Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal seeming to block any further ascent. He dropped to sixth in 2014 after his back surgery and then appeared stymied at second for the past year as 12-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic went through the peak of his reign. The belief and the hard work never dropped off. Different coaches, tweaked training, a renewed focus on the basics that, in this year alone, has seen his second serve refashioned and accelerated. In defeat by Kei Nishikori in the US Open quarter-finals in September and Juan Martin del Potro in the Davis Cup semi-finals soon afterwards, he seemed physically spent - only to emerge revitalised in the past two months on this celebrated spree across first east Asia and now western Europe. And it is testament to self-belief too - that in an era decorated by three of the greatest players of all time, he could be crowned the best; that seven years and two months after first reaching number two, he could still take that final special step. Plenty of fine Grand Slam-winning players have never been world number one, Michael Chang, Goran Ivanisevic and Michael Stich among them. Many who have got there are arguably now in Murray's shadow: Pat Rafter, Carlos Moya, Marcelo Rios; definitely Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Thomas Muster; quite possibly Marat Safin and Andy Roddick, Ilie Nastase, Gustavo Kuerten and Lleyton Hewitt too. Rankings in sport do not always reflect the accepted wisdom. Angelique Kerber may sit above Serena Williams in the women's tennis rankings, but with Williams having won five of their past six meetings and seven times as many career titles, the debate over who is the better player would be short. Triathlon's world rankings, based only on the year's World Series results, have Spain's Mario Mola as world number one, when every judge in the sport would define double Olympic champion Alistair Brownlee as the best in the world. Few could dispute Nick Faldo's claim to be the best golfer in the world when he topped golf's rankings. A few days after going to number one himself, Ian Woosnam would win the Masters. Luke Donald's ascension in 2011 was deserved - he was the first player in history to win the money title on both European and PGA tours in the same season - but because he had never finished as runner-up in a major, let alone won one, there were those who disputed the algorithm's accuracy. So too with Lee Westwood, number one in the same year, still to win a major five years on. The number alone can be less important than the aura a player brings to it. After an unparalleled 12 months - that Davis Cup triumph, winning BBC Sports Personality for the second time, reaching his first French Open final, winning his second Wimbledon, taking Olympic singles gold yet again - Murray has that too. Media playback is not supported on this device And this may yet be the start of something even more beautiful, rather than the pinnacle. After five defeats in the Australian Open final, never will Murray have a better chance of winning it than this January, Federer and Nadal faded, Djokovic - his nemesis in four of those finals - jaded. The French Open title could conceivably be the next unprecedented prize to be pouched. And then Wimbledon again, and why not, after all that has been before? It is dreamy, fanciful stuff. But that has been Murray's motif: ripping up precedent, making the impossible real.	This has been the era where British sport has blessed its loyal followers like never before: fourth, third and second places in the Olympic medal table; the Tour de France yellow jersey won in four of the past five years; the miracle of a first male Wimbledon champion in 77 years, a marvel repeated three years on; the Davis Cup won for the first time since tennis was played in slacks and cable-knit jumpers.
Nottinghamshire Police were present when the man fell from a building in the Radford area of Nottingham on Friday evening. A witness told the Nottingham Post he survived the first fall before running to another flat and falling again. Police are not treating the death of the man, in his mid-30s, as suspicious. Officers were called to Waterloo Road at about 19:30 GMT.	The death of a man who twice apparently jumped from a building has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
Police said Kinga Pelc from the east Belfast area died in hospital on Saturday. A man in his 20s remains in a critical condition in hospital following the incident. It happened on the Annadale Embankment at about 15:00 BST on Friday. Two other people were taken to hospital for treatment to their injuries after the crash. Their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.	A 21-year-old woman has died following a crash involving two cars in south Belfast.
Fujimori said in a letter he intended to share thoughts and memories, happy and sad, while serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations. The social media accounts would be managed by a group of supporters. The 75-year-old governed Peru for a decade before being impeached and fleeing the country in 2000. Peru's Justice minister, Daniel Figallo, reacted angrily to Fujimori's announcement. "People who commit violations and have their liberty taken from them have their rights limited. Otherwise, we turn prisons into hotels," he told reporters. Mr Figallo reportedly asked the prison director to limit Fujimori's access to social media. The former leader still has supporters in Peru and vowed to reveal his thoughts online. "In this way, I'll be able to share my thoughts, memories and illusions,  sorrows and joys," his letter read. Peru's President Ollanta Humala recently rejected Fujimori's request for a pardon on humanitarian grounds. Earlier this week, the authorities rejected a bid by Fujimori's lawyer to have him  transferred to house arrest. After being stripped of his powers by the country's Congress in 2000, the leader sought exile in Japan. He eventually returned to Chile, where he was arrested in 2005. After losing a lengthy legal battle, he was extradited to Peru in 2007 and convicted of human rights violations after a 15-month trial. He was accused of authorising death-squad killings in two incidents known as La Cantuta and Barrios Altos, and the kidnapping of a journalist and a businessman. Mr Fujimori repeatedly denied the charges, saying they were politically motivated.	The former president of Peru, Alberto Fujimori, has said he will publish excerpts from his memoirs on the social media websites Twitter and Facebook.
Relatives say they have evidence that she was murdered as part of a policy of deliberately killing journalists. The wrongful death lawsuit was filed at a district court in Washington DC. Colvin was reporting from the rebel-held area of Baba Amr, in Homs, in February 2012, when she was killed by government artillery. Shortly before, she did live broadcasts for the BBC, Channel Four and CNN. "I watched a little baby die today," she said, talking over pictures of a child who had been hit by a sniper bullet. "That is happening over and over and over." She told the BBC that President Assad's forces were "shelling with impunity, with merciless disregard for civilians". She told CNN it was "a complete and utter lie that they're only going after terroristsâ€¦ The Syrian army is simply shelling a city of cold, starving civilians". The Colvin family believes that the satellite phone used in these broadcasts was traced by Syrian intelligence and used to locate the Baba Amr media centre, where she was based. According to documents obtained by their lawyers, a government informant then confirmed the location. An attack on the journalists was ordered that night, the lawsuit says. "The transmissions were intercepted, and they were tracked to their GPS co-ordinates," said one of the legal team, Scott Gilmore. "On top of that there was a whole web of informants who were already out searching for the journalists. Any journalist in Homsâ€¦ could have been a target". Marie's photographer, Paul Conroy, had told the BBC shortly after the attack that the incoming rounds were "bracketed" on the media centre, meaning they were being deliberately targeted. Conroy had served in an artillery regiment in the British Army. "As an artilleryman, I think that was a good day's work for a for a well-trained team. Nothing smacked of randomness in that situation," he said. Now the family's lawyers say they have witnesses and documents smuggled out of Syria to prove this. The lawsuit is the fruit of four years of research by the US-based Center for Justice and Accountability. The documents are said to show that the artillery strike was approved or ordered by President Assad's brother Maher, commander of the Republican Guards. The policy of targeting journalists is alleged to have been made by senior officials in the Central Crisis Management Cell, President Assad's war cabinet. "I'm really proud to be able to bring this lawsuit," said Marie Colvin's sister, Cat. "We know who Marie's killers are now; we want them brought to justice. I want them to be held accountable." She went on: "I'm very sensitive to the suffering of the Syrian people. I know I'm not the only one who's lost a sister and my mom is not the only one who is mourning the loss of a daughter. "I'm in a unique position to be able to use the court to be able be bring Marie's killers to justice. I want to give a voice to the Syrian people. I want them to know we haven't forgotten them." The shelling in Baba Amr was the most intense any of us in the BBC team had ever seen. The Syrians there were all wondering if this would be another Hama - the town destroyed by the old President Assad's artillery in 1982. Some 10,000-20,000 people were killed - there is still no accurate estimate - but not a single image was published of the carnage. In the age of the cameraphone and YouTube, that was not going to happen in Baba Amr. But - we believed - the regime still feared what effect the presence of international journalists would have. "We could destroy Baba Amr in 10 minutes, if there were no cameras," a regime official is supposed to have said, according to documents and witness statements obtained by the Colvin family's lawyers. The lawsuit says Marie was deliberately murdered according to orders given by some of the most senior officials in the Syrian regime. One of those who helped carry out the attack is said to have been rewarded by the Assad family with the gift of a car. These are allegations, yet to be tested in court. But the murder of journalists is just one war crime among many of which the regime stands accused. The Colvin family hopes the lawsuit will be a reminder of that - as some in the international community seek to rehabilitate President Assad.	The family of Marie Colvin, the American journalist who died in Syria four years ago, is suing the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.
"Golden Rice" has been developed by scientists to combat vitamin A deficiency, which affects millions of children in the developing world. The crop was just weeks away from being submitted to the authorities for a safety evaluation. But a group of around 400 protestors attacked the field trial in the Bicol region and uprooted all the GM plants. The project to develop Golden Rice was started 20 years ago in 1993 by German researchers with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation. The rice has been modified by adding extra genes that turn on the plant's ability to produce beta-carotene, which humans can convert into vitamin A. A lack of this vitamin increases the chances of blindness and susceptibility to disease. Vitamin A deficiency is a significant problem among children in developing countries. According to Helen Keller International, around 670,000 children will die each year from the problem, while 350,000 will go blind. It is estimated that one cup of Golden Rice could provide half an adult's recommended daily intake. Golden Rice field trials are currently being carried out in the Philippines under the auspices of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), together with PhilRice, the local research body. Five small test plots have been planted with the idea that there would shortly be a submission to the regulatory authority of the Philippines. It was hoped that initial releases to farmers could happen in 2014. The plot in Bicol was guarded and fenced but the protestors broke through the security and uprooted and trampled the rice plants. The attackers who were members of a group called Sikwal-Gmo say they attacked the crop because they believe that GM technology is not the solution to malnutrition in the Philippines. The protestors argue that international agrochemical corporations and the US are behind the drive for Golden Rice. In a statement, they said they were concerned that the rice trial was both a danger to human health and biodiversity. The scientists involved with the trial say they were relieved that no-one was hurt during the incident. "It was not completely unexpected as we had heard threats," the IRRI's Dr Bruce Tolentino told BBC News. "It was certainly disappointing to have our field trial vandalised because our Golden Rice research aims to avoid the horrible plight of women and children suffering vitamin A deficiency." The researchers say that the development of the modified rice remains critical for the Philippines as 1.7 million children in the country aged under five are affected by vitamin A deficiency. They say they are determined to go ahead with the project. "This is not a major setback, because it is just one trial of a series and just one of several sites. We remain completely committed to continuing our Golden Rice research to help improve people's nutrition," said Dr Tolentino. The development of GM technology is highly contentious in the Philippines. Earlier this year, the Court of Appeals rejected another crop, an eggplant that had been modified to produce toxins to a pest. The court ruled that the crop violated the constitutional rights of Filipinos to health and a balanced ecology. Follow Matt on Twitter.

Although such an event should have been predicted and planned for, the panel said, it found gaping holes in safety standards and emergency procedures. Here is an outline of key quotes, findings and recommendations from the 88-page executive summary of the Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission's report. The earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011 were natural disasters of a magnitude that shocked the entire world. Although triggered by these cataclysmic events, the subsequent accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant cannot be regarded as a natural disaster. It was a profoundly manmade disaster - that could and should have been foreseen and prevented... Our report catalogues a multitude of errors and wilful negligence that left the Fukushima plant unprepared for the events of March 11. And it examines serious deficiencies in the response to the accident by Tepco, regulators and the government. For all the extensive detail it provides, what this report cannot fully convey - especially to a global audience - is the mindset that supported the negligence behind this disaster. What must be admitted - very painfully - is that this was a disaster "Made in Japan." Its fundamental causes are to be found in the ingrained conventions of Japanese culture: our reflexive obedience; our reluctance to question authority; our devotion to 'sticking with the program'; our groupism; and our insularity. (Chairman Kiyoshi Kurokawa) Collusion and lack of governance The Tepco Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant accident was the result of collusion between the government, the regulators and [private plant operator] Tepco, and the lack of governance by said parties. They effectively betrayed the nation's right to be safe from nuclear accidents. Therefore, we conclude that the accident was clearly "manmade"... We believe that the root causes were the organizational and regulatory systems... rather than issues relating to the competency of any specific individual. [All parties] failed to correctly develop the most basic safety requirements - such as assessing the probability of damage, preparing for containing collateral damage from such a disaster, and developing evacuation plans for the public in the case of a serious radiation release. Organisational problems within Tepco Had there been a higher level of knowledge, training, and equipment inspection related to severe accidents, and had there been specific instructions given to the on-site workers concerning the state of emergency within the necessary time frame, a more effective accident response would have been possible... Sections in the diagrams of the severe accident instruction manual were missing. Emergency response issues The government, the regulators, Tepco management, and the Kantei [prime minister's office] lacked the preparation and the mindset to efficiently operate an emergency response to an accident of this scope. None, therefore, were effective in preventing or limiting the consequential damage. In the critical period just after the accident, the Kantei did not promptly declare a state of emergency. The regional nuclear emergency response team was meant to be the contact between the Kantei and the operator, responsible for keeping the Kantei informed about the situation on the ground. Instead, the Kantei contacted Tepco headquarters and the Fukushima site directly, and disrupted the planned chain of command. Evacuation issues The Commission concludes that the residents' confusion over the evacuation stemmed from the regulators' negligence and failure over the years to implement adequate measures against a nuclear disaster, as well as a lack of action by previous governments and regulators focused on crisis management. The crisis management system that existed for the Kantei and the regulators should protect the health and safety of the public, but it failed in this function. The central government... failed to convey the severity of the accident... [O]nly 20% of the residents of the town hosting the plant knew about the accident when evacuation from the 3km zone was ordered at 21:23 on the evening of March 11. There was great confusion over the evacuation, caused by prolonged shelter-in-place orders and voluntary evacuation orders. Some residents were evacuated to high dosage areas because radiation monitoring information was not provided. Continuing public health and welfare issues [R]esidents in the affected area are still struggling from the effects of the accident. They continue to face grave concerns, including the health effects of radiation exposure, displacement, the dissolution of families, disruption of their lives and lifestyles and the contamination of vast areas of the environment. ... The Commission concludes that the government and the regulators are not fully committed to protecting public health and safety; that they have not acted to protect the health of the residents and to restore their welfare. Approximately 150,000 people were evacuated in response to the accident... Insufficient evacuation planning led to many residents receiving unnecessary radiation exposure. Others were forced to move multiple times, resulting in increased stress and health risks - including deaths among seriously ill patients. "If there had been even a word about a nuclear power plant when the evacuation was ordered, we could have reacted reasonably, taken our valuables with us or locked up the house before we had left. We had to run with nothing but the clothes we were wearing. It is such a disappointment every time we are briefly allowed to return home only to find out that we have been robbed again." (Comment by a resident of Okuma, from report appendices) Regulator failures The regulators did not monitor or supervise nuclear safety... They avoided their direct responsibilities by letting operators apply regulations on a voluntary basis. Their independence from the political arena, the ministries promoting nuclear energy, and the operators was a mockery. They were incapable, and lacked the expertise and the commitment to assure the safety of nuclear power. Operator failures Tepco did not fulfil its responsibilities as a private corporation, instead obeying and relying upon the government bureaucracy of Meti, the government agency driving nuclear policy. At the same time... it manipulated the cosy relationship with the regulators to take the teeth out of regulations. Shortcomings in laws and regulations Laws and regulations related to nuclear energy have only been revised as stopgap measures, based on actual accidents. They have not been seriously and comprehensively reviewed in line with the accident response and safeguarding measures of an international standard. As a result, predictable risks have not been addressed. The existing regulations primarily are biased toward the promotion of a nuclear energy policy, and not to public safety, health and welfare. The unambiguous responsibility that operators should bear for a nuclear disaster was not specified. There was also no clear guidance about the responsibilities of the related parties in the case of an emergency. No 'cosmetic solutions' Replacing people or changing the names of institutions will not solve the problems. Unless these root causes are resolved, preventive measures against future similar accidents will never be complete... The underlying issue is the social structure that results in "regulatory capture," and the organisational, institutional, and legal framework that allows individuals to justify their own actions, hide them when inconvenient, and leave no records in order to avoid responsibility.	A Japanese parliamentary panel has delivered a damning verdict after investigating the accident at the Fukushima nuclear plant which followed an earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011.
In less than 24 hours, the country's chosen to leave the European Union, abandoning an institution, a concept that's been part of the fabric our institutions since the 1970s. As a result, the prime minister has left his job. Some Labour MP s are trying to unseat their leader. And Scotland faces another referendum on the other union. Tonight it's not clear who'll be running the country in three months time. It's not certain if the leader of the opposition will stay in post beyond the weekend. But remember, this was not an overwhelming surge to one side. Decisive yes, but a move in the margins. Yet in a referendum - a binary vote - that produces a result that could change everything for generations. It is not so much that politics has been turned upside down - but the conventional rules, the expectations - have been scrapped by one decision. The prime minister's judgement, his mistaken analysis of how to win the public over, cost his job. And almost the entire establishment's appeal to the electorate was rejected. One member of the cabinet pointed to the problem: "they don't believe us". Right now, it is not at all inevitable that's a problem the current generation of politicians will ever be able to fix.	Tourists and members of the public drifted to Westminster's College Green - to witness this day, and also, perhaps, just to make sense of what's going on.
Kevin McGuigan Sr was shot dead at his home at Comber Court in the Short Strand on Wednesday. Police believe two men shot him several times in the head and chest at point blank range before running off. The BBC understands the 53-year-old was one of a number of suspects in the murder of Gerard 'Jock' Davison in May. Sinn Féin has denied speculation that Provisional IRA may have been involved in his murder. The DUP said there will be "repercussions" if that is the case. Mr McGuigan, a father-of-nine, was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital but died a short time later. BBC Northern Ireland home affairs correspondent Vincent Kearney said Mr McGuigan was killed by two masked men using semi-automatic weapons in a "professional, execution-style killing". Appealing for information, the officer leading the murder investigation said the gunmen were on foot and wearing dark clothing with their faces covered. "We need to hear from anyone who has information about the events of last night, about the movements of the gunmen both leading up to and immediately after the shooting," said Det Ch Insp John McVea. Mr McGuigan had been questioned by police after the murder of Jock Davison in the Markets area of Belfast three months ago. Mr Davison, 47, was a former IRA commander and a former friend of Mr McGuigan. The IRA pair were also founding members of the paramilitary group Direct Action Against Drugs (DAAD), which killed more than a dozen alleged drug dealers. They were later involved in a feud, and Mr McGuigan was shot several times in a so-called punishment attack. It was claimed that Mr Davison gave the order for that attack on his former friend. Det Ch Insp McVea said police were "aware of speculation around a possible motive" for the murder of Mr McGuigan. The detective said that in the investigation into the murder of Mr Davison, Mr McGuigan was questioned "as a potential witness, not a suspect", and this was still the police's position. "Speculation is not helpful and is potentially dangerous," he said. "People should allow the police investigation to take its course and provide any information they have to detectives." However, the police officer did not go as far as entirely ruling him out as a suspect. "I am saying the investigation team into the murder of Jock Davison would remain open minded as to who is responsible," he told a news conference. The detective also appealed for "those with influence in the community to use all their efforts to reduce tension and appeal for calm and restraint at this very difficult time". The victim's elderly mother, Margaret McGuigan, told the BBC that her son's killers would have to live with what they had done. She added there had been "too many murders" in the area and that she hoped her son's would be the last.	A former Provisional IRA member murdered in front of his wife was shot dead in a "ruthless and premeditated killing", police have said.
About 1,000 people gathered to observe a minute of silence and light candles in front of the Senedd. There are over 2,000 French people living in south Wales registered with the French consulate in London. Marie Brousseau-Navarro, the Honorary Consul of France in Cardiff, said messages of support had been touching. She said: "We are united in shock and united in sorrow... And united with all the people who have marched across the world." Saleem Kidwai, chairman of the Muslim Council of Wales was applauded by the crowd as he told them to "stand together shoulder to shoulder". "My condemnation is absolute," he said. "We will eventually win and truth wins over falsehood and light over darkness." First Minister Carwyn Jones was among the many to hold up a candle for the silence, while others held up pencils. The silence was marked at the end by an applause. Earlier, he said: "The vigil in Cardiff Bay tonight is an opportunity for the people of Wales to pay their respects to those who lost their lives in the truly abhorrent attack in Paris. "It is also a chance to show solidarity with the people of France and all those who believe in upholding our democratic values and freedoms that are threatened by such senseless acts of terror." Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb tweeted earlier: "Standing with the French community in Wales and in support of freedom of speech everywhere. 6pm this eve. Senedd, Cardiff. #CharlieHebdo" In a show of unity, London landmarks have been lit in the colours of the French national flag. And world leaders have gathered in Paris for a huge unity march involving over one million people, dwarfing Saturday's marches that saw 700,000 take to the streets. On Saturday, Swansea City striker Bafetimbi Gomis dedicated his side's goal in the 1-1 draw with West Ham to the victims of the Paris terror attacks. Wales' police forces and media organisations held a minute's silence to support those attacked in the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris on Wednesday. A police officer was killed on Thursday and French forces stormed two separate hostage sites in and around Paris, killing three hostage takers, on Friday. "We have been really moved by the hundreds of messages of support and condolences," said Ms Brousseau-Navarro. "Most of all we appreciate the support and solidarity."	A vigil has taken place in Cardiff Bay for French citizens and others following terror acts in Paris which left 17 people dead in three days.
The detective leading the enquiry said the soldiers are not obliged to speak to the police because they are being treated as witnesses and not suspects. Thirteen civilians were killed when soldiers opened fire on a civil rights march in Londonderry in 1972.  A 14th died later. Police resumed their investigation into the killings in January.. The information about 100 soldiers being contacted emerged on Thursday following fresh criticism of the police investigation by some Bloody Sunday families. Det Ch Insp Ian Harrison, from the PSNI's Legacy Investigations Branch, said his team completed its "civilian witness enquiries" and made contact with more than 100 soldiers to "determine if they are willing to engage with us". "It should be noted that these soldiers are witnesses, not suspects, and are therefore not obliged to speak with us," said Mr Harrison. "The next stage of the investigation would be to interview those soldiers who are willing to engage with the enquiry team as witnesses." Mr Harrison said his team of officers was also carrying out a number of other enquiries in relation to the investigation which he described as a "long, complex and protracted". "I am content with the level of resources I have working on the investigation at this stage. "If at any time further resources are required they will be made available to me." Some Bloody Sunday families criticised the police investigation in a letter to Detective Chief Inspector Ian Harrison from Peter Madden of Madden and Finucane Solicitors. It said that some of the families were losing faith in the investigation because they had "heard nothing from the PSNI since a meeting in January and were entirely unaware of what progress had been made". Peter Madden also said there was a presumption that there had "still been no move by the PSNI to interview any of the soldiers involved in the shootings" and that this added to a perception that police were "reluctant to arrest and question soldiers as murder suspects". The letter continued: "Regrettably, as we fast approach the fifth anniversary of the delivery of Lord Saville's report, it seems that little has occurred in the interim to alleviate those public concerns and those that we represent are rapidly losing faith in the PSNI's ability to see their task through." Peter Madden demanded another meeting between the police and the families he represents. He also asked Detective Chief Inspector Ian Harrison to set out a full written progress report within the next 14 days. Mickey McKinney, whose brother William was killed on Bloody Sunday, told BBC Radio Foyle: "The entire investigation has slowed down. "The last meeting with the police was five months ago and we have been told nothing since then. "There was an agreement that there would be a meeting with families every three months but that hasn't been happening. "I only found out about the 100 soldiers being contacted last night (Thursday) but we want suspects being questioned in this case. "Sometimes I and other families just feel we are on a road to nowhere. "Some of the families would like to meet the PSNI immediately. "Time is a major factor in all of this. Suspects are not getting any younger."	The PSNI has contacted more than 100 soldiers as part of the investigation into Bloody Sunday.
Samuel Ward scored a goal either side of half-time to set up the victory, before Henry Weir made sure of the result in the final quarter. Jackson went close to scoring, shooting after the Dutch had pushed their keeper outfield, but Weir deflected it in. The result follows Thursday's 1-1 draw against hosts Germany. Britain face Belgium in their final match on Sunday (10:30 BST).	Great Britain beat the Netherlands 3-0 in the Ergo Masters Four Nations Invitational in Dusseldorf as Ashley Jackson won his 100th cap.
The Executive Office said the move was made "to enable doctors to conduct a medical assessment". Mr McGuinness was due to join the first minister on the trade mission. A spokesperson said he was "fulfilling his responsibilities as deputy first minister working with his departmental political advisers". "There has been no disruption to the work of The Executive Office during this period," added the spokesperson. Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said: "I'm sure everybody who values his work will send best wishes to Martin, Bernie and their family. "I met Martin as normal at Stormont on Monday. I have been in regular contact with him since and he is totally committed to fulfilling his duties."	Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness pulled out of a trip to China this week due to medical advice, it has been revealed.
The Belfast Policing and Community Safety Partnership's 'Drug Dealers Don't Care, Do You?' campaign ran from February to April. In that time, the PSNI also arrested 357 people and seized £44,000 in cash. Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr said the principal drug seized was herbal cannabis. "Along with our partners, we've invested a considerable amount of time and effort into this campaign and it has delivered worthwhile outcomes," he said. "We arrested 357 suspects, charged 78 of them, reported 163 and released 55 on police bail." A spokesperson for Belfast PCSP said: "It's encouraging that the 'Drug Dealers Don't Care' campaign would appear to be having some impact in helping to tackle the scourge of drugs on our streets and in our communities. "These latest figures demonstrate that by working in partnership and coordinating our resources we can be more effective."	Almost £1.5m of illegal drugs have been seized in Northern Ireland following a media campaign against drug dealers, police have said.
Elizabeth Passmore's final report before retirement complains admissions are too often "unnecessarily complex", "unfair" or unclear. Schools which are their own admissions authorities, like academies or faith schools, are more likely to be at fault, says the report. The government said it would review the findings and take action where needed. England's School Admissions Code requires places to be offered in a fair and open way, with arrangements set out so that parents can "understand easily how places for that school will be allocated". Admission arrangements run by local authorities for community and voluntary controlled schools "are almost always clear and uncomplicated so it is easy for parents and others to understand how places will be allocated" says the report, published late last year. But "the complexity of some schools' admission arrangements continues to be a matter of concern," writes Dr Passmore. "The arrangements set by some own-admission authority schools have so many levels of priority that often it is unclear how the arrangements could actually be applied." These complex arrangements can include numerous oversubscription criteria, different sub-categories of places, more than one catchment area, feeder schools, banding tests and aptitude assessments, says the report. "The complex arrangements of some schools do not serve local children well," adds Dr Passmore. Too often, says the report, admission arrangements are hard to find on school websites or not published at all, while some faith schools ask parents to fill in supplementary forms, asking for information prohibited under the code. Dr Passmore says banding tests are proving a particular problem. Schools say they use them to ensure a comprehensive intake but the report suggests they can be used to increase numbers of higher ability pupils. "Children living near the school, but placed in a band with many similar children, may not be allocated a place," says the report. "The first hurdle in gaining a place is to take the test." These tests are also expensive, up to Â£500 per child to administer, and the report questions the effects of banding on children, its purpose and costs. Dr Passmore also said she was "surprised and concerned" by an increase in schools operating as their own admissions authorities employing lawyers when they receive objections to the criteria they use to admit children. "Schools should be able to construct lawful arguments to their arrangements without recourse to legal advice," she writes. Overall the report notes the adjudicator dealt with 218 admissions cases in 2014-15, down from 274 the previous year, but the number upheld or partially upheld rose to 159, from 99 in 2013-14. And local authorities withdrew 284 offers of school places because of fraud, up from 186 the previous year. Margaret Tulloch of the Comprehensive Futures campaign group described the report as "very disturbing" and called for a "wholesale review of school admissions". "She is right to raise concerns about own-admission authority schools failing to meet the requirement of the code and about so-called fair banding. "These problems will only increase as more schools become academies." A Department for Education spokesman said the government wanted every child to have the opportunity of going to a good local school. "The chief adjudicator's annual report helps us identify how we can continue to improve the admissions framework to ensure fair access for all children. "We will review her findings and take action where appropriate." said the spokesman.	Too many schools in England break the rules on admissions arrangements, says the outgoing chief schools adjudicator.
The secretary of state was, by all accounts, a member of the "Remain Campaign" lobbying against a US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. So President Trump's "Climate Brexit" was a blow to him - in an ironic twist the fossil fuel company he used to head supports the accord while the government he now represents does not. It was also a blow to the State Department, and to diplomacy. How much of a personal setback is not clear because on this, as on other issues, Tillerson kept a low profile. Twenty-four hours after the decision, the only comment he'd made was an aside at a photo-opportunity. He declared that the US would continue its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and appealed for partners to keep things "in perspective". Tillerson had previously said the US should "maintain its seat at the table" on international climate conversations, a sensible position for the nation's top diplomat and one that he reportedly maintained in White House debates on the Paris Agreement. But publicly he showed none of the passion demonstrated by his predecessor, John Kerry, who powered negotiations on the deal. It seems the president's daughter, Ivanka, took the lead in fighting the corner for the Remainers. And the role of super-engaged interlocutor apparently fell to the climate change sceptic in the administration, Environment Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, who spoke at the Rose Garden ceremony. Mr Tillerson did not attend, whether out of resignation or as an everyday-act-of-resistance, we don't know. A State Department official said only that he was in his office and "maintained his schedule, preparing for his trip today to Australia and New Zealand". No doubt Pruitt (and his ally, White House adviser Steve Bannon) had an easier task than Tillerson, given that he was preaching to a president sympathetic to his economic and nationalist arguments. But the results are another professional blow to the secretary of state. He's already facing a proposed budget cut that looks to gut his department. And the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has even less diplomatic experience than he does, has forged a parallel foreign policy track from the White House. Clearly, the Paris withdrawal was also bad news for the State Department, which has yet to issue a statement. Where it once straddled the front lines of global climate negotiations, it's now been dropped off the map. The US does remain a member of the UN framework for climate change issues, the UNFCCC, but those meetings have become mostly about the Paris Agreement. Finally, it's a rejection of a monumental diplomatic effort by more than 190 countries over many years to strike all the balances that needed to be struck. "We have now slapped every country in the world in the face," says Todd Stern, the US Special Envoy for Climate Change in the Obama administration. "We've said we know this matters to you a lot, we know this is a huge potentially epic issue for the world, we know that some of you are particularly vulnerable, but we drop out. It's the worst way you could treat other countries." To be fair, this is not entirely untravelled ground - remember George W Bush's decision against ratifying the 1997 Kyoto climate change treaty. But it is more starkly isolationist, and this is a different Washington - in private chats, international diplomats from across the global spectrum complain that normal channels for getting and giving information at the State Department and White House are still unstaffed. They struggle to find the people who can listen to their concerns or tell them what's going on. So while this will not break alliances, it could be more difficult to pick up the pieces and say we can still be friends. Follow Barbara on Twitter	Last month when Rex Tillerson tried to translate "America First" into foreign policy terms for a bemused audience of State Department employees, he probably didn't expect it would come to mean "America Alone."
The march from Camberwell, south London, to Downing Street has been called to raise awareness of vulnerable people who used the service. The charity was closed following a row over funding. Kids Company has denied allegations of financial mismanagement. The prime minister said the government had been right to give the charity one more chance. Before it shut its doors on Wednesday, Kids Company provided practical, emotional and educational support to some of the most deprived and vulnerable inner-city children and young people in London, Liverpool and Bristol. It was founded in 1996 by Camila Batmanghelidjh. David Cameron said he was sad at the closure of the charity, which had been given a Â£3m government grant last week. He said: "The government thought it was the right thing to do to give this charity one last chance of restructuring to try and make sure it could continue its excellent work. "Sadly that didn't happen, not least because of the allegations that were made and private donors withdrawing their money but I think the government was right to say let's have one last go trying to keep this charity going, given the work it's done for so many young people." Some 150 people gathered outside the charity's former centre in Camberwell to take part in the march to Parliament. Lisa Moodie, who has been a youth worker with the charity for seven years, said: "Today isn't about Camila, it's about love, it's about making sure the children's voices are heard. "I agree people need to be accountable for what happens to our young people, it's not acceptable that we just leave them discarded. These are very vulnerable young people, they live chaotic lifestyles. "When they mess up, we're here for them just as your parents would be. It's very difficult to measure success in a hospital - it would be how many broken bones do you have. How we measure success can be in small things. It might be learning how to use a knife and fork." Anita Ebirim, who brought her eight-year-old daughter to the charity, said: "Why did they close Kids Company? It's a place we come to save our lives. "Every day we come here to eat our lunch... we get breakfast, we get clothes.  A lot of young men come who don't work, but it stops them messing around and getting into drugs." Kids Company employs 600 paid staff, as well as working with a pool of about 8,000 volunteers and 500 students. Marie, a 30-year-old volunteer from Wimbledon, said: "It makes no sense, it hasn't really sunk in yet. The kids keep coming and find out by the notice on the gates . We didn't have time to say our goodbyes to the kids." The charity has been beset by problems, including allegations of financial mismanagement and accusations by former staff that the charity failed to deal with allegations of serious incidents. Kids Company is also being investigated by the Met Police's Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command. Ms Batmanghelidjh has strongly denied any wrongdoing.	Supporters of the closed charity Kids Company are taking part in a march in London.
Labour MP for Bassetlaw, John Mann, a Leave campaigner, said people voted to leave because of immigration, zero-hour contracts and job prospects and said a "divide in Britain" had been exposed. Mansfield voted most strongly to leave, with 70.9% backing Brexit. Rushcliffe, which includes the towns of West Bridgford and Bingham, was the only area to vote for Remain. It saw the East Midland's highest turnout. Meanwhile, the turnout in Nottingham was the fifth lowest in the UK at 61.8%. Leave won by a tiny margin of just over 2,000 votes in the city. Mr Mann said his party was "somewhat out of touch". "With the middle classes largely voting remain because they see it as benefiting them and the working classes largely voting to leave because it dis-benefits them - that's the divide in Britain," he said. Latest reaction and updates from Nottinghamshire Like large parts of England, Nottinghamshire overwhelmingly voted to leave the European Union. The margin of victory in Bassetlaw, Ashfield and Mansfield was huge, with less than a third of people voting remain. Arguably the biggest surprise came in Nottingham, which narrowly backed Brexit. Affluent Rushcliffe was the only area to vote Remain. Overall Nottinghamshire voted 57.9% for Leave and 42.1% for Remain. Conservative Anna Soubry, the MP for Broxtowe and a Remain campaigner, tweeted it was "a dreadful decision". "People like me were told you're scaremongering, we don't want to listen to the experts," she said. "All that has been unfortunately proved to be accurate. We have made a very, very, very bad mistake." Labour MP for Nottingham North, Graham Allen, said David Cameron had "gambled with Britain's future" by calling for a referendum, saying people voted to leave "in protest" at the current government. Turnout was 81.5% in Rushcliffe - the highest in the East Midlands and the only council area to vote Remain. The vote was close elsewhere, including in Nottingham, where the split was 50.8% Leave, 49.2% Remain. Alice, a caller to BBC Radio Nottingham from the Carrington area of the city, said she felt "frightened of the future". "It potentially gives a mandate for a lot of prejudice against people who have immigrated here, whether from the EU or elsewhere," she said.	All but one council area of Nottinghamshire, including Nottingham city, has voted to leave the EU.
Mr Abe described the 90-minute meeting in Trump Tower, New York, as "candid", with a "warm atmosphere". Some of Mr Trump's campaign rhetoric cast doubt over long-standing US alliances, including with Japan. The meeting was Mr Trump's first face-to-face with a world leader since winning the presidential election. The US and Japan have been key allies since the end of World War Two, when the US helped Japan rebuild its economy. The president-elect has vowed to scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which Mr Abe strenuously supports as a means of countering China's growing economic strength. The deal was approved by the Japanese parliament, despite the likelihood that it would be cancelled when Mr Trump takes office. Mr Trump has also said Japan needs to pay more to maintain US troops on its soil, and has floated the idea that Japan and South Korea should develop their own nuclear weapons to counter the threat from North Korean missiles. The meeting was reportedly arranged when Mr Abe rang the president-elect to congratulate him, mentioning that he would be passing through New York on the way to an Asia-Pacific trade summit in Peru. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Abe said: "We were able to have a very candid talk over a substantial amount of time. We held it in a very warm atmosphere. "I do believe that without confidence between the two nations the alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence." The Japanese leader gave few details of the meeting but added the two agreed to meet again for deeper talks on a wider range of issues. Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, who have emerged as key advisers to Mr Trump since his surprise election victory, also met Mr Abe at Trump Tower. Media speculation over her role has included the possibility of her becoming ambassador to Japan. In the days since the election, Mr Trump has been speaking to dozens of world leaders as well as possible cabinet appointees from his home and office inside the Manhattan skyscraper. In other developments: Elsewhere, vice president-elect and Trump transition lead Mike Pence has said he is confident Donald Trump's administration can work with Democrats. Emerging from meetings with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Mr Pence said he looks "forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward". Meanwhile, US President Barack Obama has urged his successor to stand up to Russia if it deviates from US "values and international norms". Speaking after talks with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin, Mr Obama said he hoped Mr Trump would "not simply take a realpolitik approach" to dealing with Russia.	Japan's PM Shinzo Abe has said he has "great confidence" in US President-elect Donald Trump and he believes they can build a relationship of trust.
Sports Minister Carál Nί Chuilίn said they stood down just before she was due to meet board representatives. They were there to discuss a report by the Head of Internal Audit at the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and the Department of Education. Ms Nί Chuilίn said she advised the remaining members at the meeting "of my deep concerns at the issues raised by their staff" with the internal auditor. On Friday, the minister called for the meeting to consider the findings of the report into "serious allegations" about the "leadership, management and the overall culture" of the organisation. After Monday's meeting, she said she had accepted the board members' resignations, and thanked them "for their efforts in promoting and fostering sport during their time in office". In a statement, she said: "Given the ongoing challenges in Sport NI, I am taking steps to intervene directly to support both staff and the remaining board members. "I also wish to advise staff that their concerns are being taken seriously and that they will be fully addressed." Chair of the culture committee Nelson McCausland said the situation was "shocking and unprecedented". "That is why we need to get Carál Nί Chuilίn in front of the committee as soon as possible," he said. "It tells  us something about the department and the way that the minister has been running the department," Mr McCausland told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster. "We also want to talk to the people who resigned, they have a story as well. "It is a whole quagmire, we need to get to the bottom of it. The minister owes that to the public, to Sport NI and to the  committee." Ms Nί Chuilίn said she would meet the remaining board members later this week. No-one from Sport NI was available for comment.	Nine members of the Sport NI board have resigned with immediate effect.
Shaw will be joined on the 18 July flight to Los Angeles by fellow England World Cup squad member Wayne Rooney. Spain's Juan Mata and David De Gea are also named, plus Japan's Shinji Kagawa. "We are delighted to have such a strong travelling squad for our pre-season tour to the United States," said assistant manager Ryan Giggs. United have already confirmed new manager Louis van Gaal will be present, even though he could be involved in the World Cup final with Netherlands, only five days before his squad leave Manchester. Van Gaal's side have a minimum of four games in the US, starting against Los Angeles Galaxy on 23 July and including an International Champions Cup programme against Roma, Nemanja Vidic's new club Inter Milan and Real Madrid.	Manchester United's £56m new signings Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw will join the squad to tour the United States later this month.
Vaughan Gething said he was "looking again at charging arrangements" for people from countries without reciprocal arrangements with the UK. In a new BBC Wales poll, 79% of those surveyed said they would increase charges for visitors from outside the UK for using the health service. But Mr Gething said such charges were a "marginal area" of NHS activity. Speaking to The Wales Report on Wednesday, he said: "We have reciprocal arrangements with most European countries, and as long as those reciprocal arrangements work I see no reason to intervene and change those. "However for people outside the UK and Europe where we don't have those, we're looking again at charging arrangements." "Later in the year I'll get to make a decision on what charging may or may not look like." But the health secretary added: "This is such a marginal area of activity." "Really, when you're talking about the central funding of the health service, with the big challenge that we face, the actual conversation about charging people from abroad is an absolute distraction." Asked whether he would consider charging patients who have illnesses caused by their lifestyle choices, Mr Gething said: "If you're really saying, for example, that someone with lung cancer who smoked should therefore be charged for their treatment. "I actually think that when you get into real examples like that, people will very quickly say that isn't what I think should happen. "When you think about the practical reality of it, it isn't that simple at all." Mr Gething warned while the Welsh Government had made "significant additional commitments" to the health service from its budget, there would be difficult consequences if austerity continues across the UK. "The challenge will be if we don't see the tide turned back on austerity every single part of the UK health service system will face really awful choices, that I don't think the public will tolerate."	The Welsh Government is reviewing NHS charges for visitors from outside the UK, the health secretary has said.
It shows Californians are starting to understand "that we are in the drought of our lives," state water regulator official Felicia Marcus said. It is the second month in a row the state has exceeded emergency conservation regulation. California has been dealing with record low water levels for four years. California Governor Jerry Brown imposed the state's first mandatory water restrictions four months ago, ordering a 25% reduction in all towns and cities. In June, the state used 27% less water than it used in the same period of 2013, when the drought emergency was first declared. This saving rose to 31.3% in July, with a cumulative saving for both months of 29.5%, the State Water Resources Control Board reported on Thursday. Felicia Marcus, who chairs the board, praised the "millions of conscientious Californians" who she described as "the real heroes here". She said record rain in July had played a role, as well as better enforcement, including warnings and penalties, and messaging by the water agencies. But, she warned, "this isn't your mother's drought or your grandmother's drought, this is the drought of the century". Drought monitors say 92% of California is currently in severe drought or worse, down from 94% at the start of the year.	Cities in California cut water use by 31.3% in July, exceeding a state-wide mandate of 25% to combat a record four-year drought there, officials say.
When we arrived at the engineer's home, the dilapidated machine was an eyesore at the bottom of his garden. "Nobody pays, nobody pays," the wealthy German-Afghan businessman told us. He offered us tea and biscuits and explained how, a few years ago, all his large hospital and road building projects were suddenly given to politicians' cronies. To add to the misfortune, around that time a roadside bomb in this war-torn country killed 15 of his workers. Later we visited a part of his armoury of German-made trucks, trailers, loaders and diggers that sat at the top of a hill, consigned, like his ambitions, to the scrapheap of history. Mr Popal told us, perhaps unsurprisingly, that he would leave Afghanistan soon unless things changed. The World Bank has said that it's harder to do business in Afghanistan than Iran, Iraq, Syria and Zimbabwe. Yet Afghanistan's new president says he wants the country "truly open for business". As a former World Bank executive himself, President Ashraf Ghani is all too familiar with the scale of the challenge. He inherited an economy in tatters after three decades of war, despite more than $100bn (??64bn) of mainly US money spent on reconstruction, which was more than the US paid to rebuild Europe after the Second World War. There's massive corruption, a lack of credit, contracts are difficult to enforce and electricity is scarce. The speed with which President Ghani dealt with the $1bn Kabul Bank scandal, one of the world's largest bank frauds, demonstrated a new political will. But the president recently missed his own deadline to form a cabinet, suggesting that deeper reforms are likely to take some time to achieve, such as simplifying Afghanistan's business environment, which has been plagued by needless red tape. Keen entrepreneurs have had to be creative to thrive. Helped by British aid money, pharmacy owner Zabi Ullah opened the country's first counterfeit-free, 24-hour chain of chemists, where customers can check if goods are real using a text message service. Old rules made it illegal to open more than one store under the same name and within 200m of each other. But Mr Ullah registered each shop under a different family member's name. It was far from ideal but was workable, based on trust. Speaking in one of his pharmacies in the capital Kabul, Mr Ullah says: "The family has been co-operative that they give me their names. They will be co-operating with me when the regulation changes and all the ownership of the licences will transfer back to [my] pharmacies." Working within antiquated rules cost the country dearly. Naseem Akbar is chief executive of the non-profit, Afghan-business focused organisation Harakat. His job is to reduce regulation in Afghanistan. He believes politicians are to blame for the weak economic growth over the past decade. He says good policies were created but never implemented, which stifled private sector development. Mr Akbar welcomes Mr Ghani's new anti-corruption approach, which he describes as "a shock to the system". He says the government must define a clear economic development strategy to bolster the investment climate in the country. Mr Akbar also wants a single organisation to run all public services to deter corruption. "Part of [what's behind] the insurgency is the disappointment that the public service offers for its people," he says. President Ghani needs to rebuild Afghanistan's financial reputation ahead of a crucial donor conference in London next month. On a recent fundraising trip to China, the president accepted Afghanistan needed foreign funds for nation building but insisted he has not asked the international community for charity. "We truly need to learn to fish, not to be given fish," he said.	The only thing Asadullah Popal's digger had gathered was dust.
Iran international Ghoochannejhad, 28, scored five goals in 42 appearances after joining the Addicks in 2014. Former Juventus defender Motta, 30, featured 12 times following his move to The Valley in February. Marko Dmitrovic, Alou Diarra and Callum Harriott have triggered one-year extensions to their current deals. Meanwhile, the south-east London club have offered a new contract to 20-year-old goalkeeper Dillon Phillips. Development squad players Zak Ansah, Alex Kelly, Ayo Obileye, Josh Staunton and Joe Pigott will also leave Charlton, who finished 22nd in the Championship this season and dropped back into League One following four years in the second tier. Jose Riga left his position of head coach following the final game of the season and the Addicks are yet to appoint a new boss. Northampton's Chris Wilder was approached to succeed the Belgian but turned the job down and joined Sheffield United instead.	Forward Reza Ghoochannejhad and full-back Marco Motta will leave relegated Charlton Athletic when their contracts expire this summer.
The girl, called Nieve, was attending the Handmade Parade in Hebden Bridge on Sunday with her grandparents when the dog jumped up and bit her. She needed eyelid surgery and suffered "potentially irreparable damage" to a tear duct. The man in the e-fit is described as being broad, bald and aged about 50. A second man, also thought to be about 50 and of similar build, was present at the time of the incident, West Yorkshire Police said. Both men left the scene without checking on the girl's welfare or leaving any details. The dog, believed to be a Staffordshire bull terrier, was on a lead at the time of the incident and is described as brindle and white coloured. PCSO Gareth Helliwell said: "The five-year-old girl involved in this incident needed reconstructive surgery to an eyelid following this attack and has suffered potentially irreparable damage to her lower tear duct." The girl's family described the dog's owner as "scum", adding "she could have lost her eye, she was covered in blood and the guy just ran off, it's cowardly". She was also bitten on the ankle despite the dog being pulled away on a lead, they said. Police appealed for anyone with information about the dog or the two men with it to contact them.	Police have issued an e-fit of a man they want to trace in connection with a dog attack on a five-year-old girl.
Councils in England, including Bradford and Birmingham, will trial the pilot scheme at local elections in 2018. The government said it would "ensure the integrity" of the electoral system. But campaigners said levels of fraud did not justify the move and one Labour MP said it would hit poorer voters. A full list of the participating councils has not yet been drawn up, but 18 council areas in England identified by the Electoral Commission as being most susceptible to voter fraud will be invited to take part in the pilot. The 18 also include Luton, Slough, Woking, Coventry and Bristol. Different local authorities will trial different types of ID, including driving licences, passports and utility bills. The creation of a new form of ID specifically for voting has been ruled out by ministers. Northern Ireland already requires voters to show ID before casting their vote. Constitution minister Chris Skidmore said fraud of any kind was unacceptable and dismissed suggestions that the plans, which could be rolled out across the whole country if successful, could disenfranchise poor people who do not have ID. He told BBC Radio Four's Today programme: "Voting is one of the most important transactions you can make as an individual. In many transactions you need a proof of ID." "I'm determined to ensure, when it comes to groups who are under-registered, that they get the opportunity to exercise their vote," he added. "Ensuring those communities are protected, that the risks of electoral fraud are diminished, will ensure those individuals are represented fairly across this country." The reform was first touted by former cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles in August, when he released recommendations amid growing concerns about electoral fraud. He tweeted that the government was "right to give greater powers to electoral officials and the police to deal with intimidation and other unwanted behaviour". In his report, Sir Eric cited research suggesting certain Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities could be more vulnerable to fraud due to a lack of understanding of the voting process. He highlighted "kinship" traditions, saying they emphasised collective over individual rights and made it more likely that people would "hand over" their vote over to others. Mr Skidmore dismissed suggestions the new measures were targeted at any "particular community" but said it was essential people across the UK were able to fulfil their democratic rights "regardless of their race or their religion". The Electoral Reform Society, which campaigns for changes to the electoral system to make it "fairer", said the move was a "blunt instrument" that could deter people from voting. "While we should take all instances of voter fraud very seriously where they occur, mandatory voter ID is a sledgehammer to crack a nut," chief executive Katie Ghose said. "The government should think very carefully before introducing barriers to voting. "There is simply no evidence to suggest that electoral fraud is widespread across the UK. Where it has occurred it has been isolated and should be tackled locally." Labour said it supported the idea in principle but views varied among its MPs with Stella Creasy, MP for Walthamstow, suggesting it was a "retrograde step" that was "more about combating low income voting" than tackling fraud. Jim Fitzpatrick, MP for Poplar and Limehouse, said he didn't have an issue with the idea as "most people carry ID". Former London mayor Ken Livingstone, who was suspended from the Labour Party and is currently an independent, said it was a "political" move and would make life more difficult for most people because of a handful of crimes. "The real problem is the people most likely not to have a passport or a driving licence are going to be the poorest and that I suspect will basically hit the Labour Party," he told Today. As well as the trials, election officials and police will be given new powers to tackle intimidation of voters by activists, who will also be banned from collecting postal votes for submission - a practice known as "harvesting". The government said it was considering plans to check the nationality of voters to stop fraudulent registrations. There will also be reforms to improve the security of the postal ballot system, including requiring postal voters to re-apply every three years.	Plans to demand proof of identity before voting in a bid to combat electoral fraud have been defended by ministers, amid criticism the move is a "sledgehammer to crack a nut".
A former field marshal, three generals and six admirals say the loss of Ark Royal and its fleet of Harrier jets has damaged Britain's defence capabilities. They say Britain can no longer mount amphibious operations without putting troops' lives at "considerable risk". Defence Secretary Liam Fox has defended the "difficult decisions". The BBC's defence correspondent, Jonathan Beale, said the letter, which was leaked to the Daily Telegraph, raises questions about what military rescue operation forces could mount in the future. In December, Dr Fox announced that the frigate sent to evacuate British nationals from Libya - HMS Cumberland - is to be decommissioned in April, following the strategic defence and security review (SDSR). Our correspondent says this is not the first time former military top brass have warned that recent cuts in the armed forces have left Britain dangerously exposed. Labour has already called for the defence review to be reopened in light of events in Egypt, Bahrain and Libya. The letter - written before the current evacuation operation in Libya - is signed by, among others, Field Marshal Lord Bramall, a former chief of the defence staff; Maj Gen Julian Thompson and Adm Sir Jeremy Black, who commanded the carrier Invincible during the Falklands conflict. Dr Fox insists Britain still has the "right military assets" in place to respond to crises. But this group of former military commanders is calling on the prime minister to reassess the decisions made in the defence review. They have called for a re-evaluation of the SDSR, which they say is "unduly trusting in an uncertain, fast-moving and dangerous world". However Dr Fox defended the steps taken to tackle the Â£38bn deficit left by Labour and said the review would not be reopened. "For our future carrier strike capability, it makes strategic sense to move towards greater inter-operability with the US and France and installing catapult and arrestor gear will deliver this. "Sustaining both Tornado and Harrier would be prohibitively expensive in this current economic climate and Tornado continues to provide vital support to the front line in Afghanistan," he said. Referring to Libya, he said Hercules C-130 aircraft had lifted 51 UK citizens to safety on Thursday - and more than 100 were on their way to Malta on HMS Cumberland. "None of our allies have seen fit to position an aircraft carrier off the coast of Libya as this is not the tool required for this task; there is no requirement for ground attack aircraft, but even if there were we would use our extensive regional basing and overflight rights," he said. But shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy said: "The government's plans were based on strategic and international geo-political assumptions, many of which have been shaken over the past month. "Recent dramatic events mean that the defence review must be reopened and perhaps even rethought. It would be sensible to stop and reflect again on our nation's strategic defence needs."	Ten retired senior military officers have written to the prime minister to voice their concerns over the loss of the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal.
Media playback is not supported on this device Former heavyweight world champion Haye, 36, made a series of graphic descriptions of hurting Bellew, with the BBBofC warning both fighters. Bellew, 34, stopped Haye in round 11, with the Londoner subsequently having surgery on a ruptured Achilles tendon. "Some of the comments went too far," Haye told BBC Sport. It is expected that any sanctions against Haye will be announced after a BBBofC meeting on Wednesday. "If I have to pay a fine, I'll happily pay and take whatever punishment I need to," he said. Haye added he now has a "different kind of respect" for WBC cruiserweight champion Bellew and would not repeat such comments before a rematch, which he reiterated his desire to pursue. "When you get into that beast mode before the fight, you're not thinking about political correctness, you're not thinking about fines, you're just thinking about getting in the ring," he said. "When you're in that beast mode you say things which rub the average person up the wrong way." Haye suffered an Achilles injury in the sixth round at the O2 Arena, with Bellew capitalising to score a knockdown. A second knockdown in the 11th round saw Haye's corner throw in the towel, which the fighter now believes could have kept him from doing "irreparable damage" to his ankle and foot. "It was a strange situation - I was getting into my flow and it felt like I stepped on a bear trap," he said. "I saw Tony look down and think 'I've got you here,' so it just became about survival - trying not to get knocked out while trying to knock him out on one leg, which is pretty tough. "I knew it was completely ruptured - the pain was terrible, when I put my foot down I could hear it crunching, but the adrenaline is so high when you're fighting you can conjure up the energy from somewhere to keep going. "I believed if I landed that one shot I could change the outcome of the fight but I was fighting a current world champion - I gave it my best shot but came up short." Bellew said he is considering retirement following his win, but admitted an offer for one further fight could be too lucrative to turn down. Haye admits a rematch "solely depends on Tony" but sees a second bout as the first step as he seeks to regain a world heavyweight title belt. "I still believe it, more now than ever, that if I'm fit and healthy, I can beat anybody," he said. "Maybe [Tony] is happy with the victory over me and if that's the case, I wish him nothing but luck. If he wants to do it again, then great. "Very few people on the planet believe I'm the best so I need to win that fight again, bare minimum, and then people can maybe look at me for world title fights. "For me, focus on the leg, and I will become the world heavyweight champion."	David Haye expects a fine from the British Boxing Board of Control for his comments in the build-up to Saturday's defeat by Tony Bellew.
It says the overnight operation took place in Nowzad district in Helmand province. Two insurgents were killed and many were detained in the raid. It came amid the Taliban's annual spring offensive, which has seen heavy fighting in Helmand. In December a similar operation led to the release of 40 people. The latest mission was carried out under the cover of darkness by the Ktah Khas, Afghanistan's counter-terrorism unit and commando forces, the statement said. Nato said its troops had "supported their Afghan partners in a train, advise and assist role". The statement gave no details about the liberated prisoners, who are said to have been taken to Kandahar to be debriefed. The Afghan forces did not sustain any casualties in the raid, Nato added. Correspondents say the operation is rare success for Afghan forces who have been put on the back foot by Taliban advances in Helmand. The Taliban have made gains since international troops withdrew from an active fighting role in 2014. Nato forces are increasingly being deployed in battle zones to support Afghan forces fighting the Taliban. Last year, the number of people killed and wounded in the conflict rose to the highest level yet recorded, the UN recently said.	Afghan special forces have freed more than 60 people held by the Taliban in a makeshift jail in the south of the country, Nato says.
The space agency has set out a three part plan, which it hopes will eventually lead to humans living on Mars by the 2030s. Unlike the Moon, humans have never physically set foot on Mars, we've only ever used robots like the Curiosity Rover. By exploring Mars with robots for the last 40 years Nasa has found out lots about our neighbouring planet, including the recent discovery that there is flowing icy water under the crust. They hope that this huge mission will help us to learn even more about not just Mars, but Earth as well. So, how will they do it? Since 2010 Nasa has been testing out the effects of what living in space can do to the human body, to prepare them for the journey to Mars, and also for living there. They have done this by sending astronauts to live onboard the International Space Station for long periods of time. Nasa also sent a team of scientists to live in a "Mars-like" dome for a year near a volcano on Earth, to see if the team can live happily on their own, away from everyday human-life. They are also doing a number of tests on Mars spacesuits and are currently trying out technology which could be used on the planet. In the "Proving Ground" part of their plan, Nasa hope to be able to do experiments in a "deep space" environment which will allow scientists and astronauts to return to Earth in a matter of days. Most of these experiments will take place in the Moon's orbit. Some of their plans include teaming up with the European Space Agency as part of their Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission in 2020, which aims to take a large asteroid from a near-Earth orbit, and move it to travel around the Moon instead. Astronauts aboard the Orion spacecraft will then explore the asteroid in the 2020s, and return to Earth with samples. NASA will also be testing out its powerful new systems such as the Space Launch System rocket and Solar Electric Propulsion, which would be used for sending supplies to the team, and also for long space travel. Nasa will build a new rover robot to join the Curiosity rover in 2020. It will have lots of new gadgets to test out on Mars. One of these gadgets is called MOXIE, and will be trying to make oxygen, which is an important part of the air we breathe here on Earth, from carbon dioxide, which is in the atmosphere on Mars, Researchers will also be investigating ways astronauts can recycle better in space. In the "Earth Independent" phase of Nasa's plan, they hope to be able to send humans to Mars, using all the research and new technology they discovered in the previous phases. At the moment it takes around eight months to travel to Mars, but scientists are looking into ways to reduce this time. By 2030 Nasa are hoping they will be able to send people to the edges and surface of Mars, not just to visit, but also to live there for a long period of time. They will be looking into ways to make fuel, water, oxygen and building materials on the Red planet. Nasa will also be looking into improving their communications systems with Earth, to allow for quicker exchanges of research and data For years scientists have been curious about the Red planet, and whether or not humans would be able to live there. Recent research has proved that there is water on the planet, and that at one point Mars' climate was perhaps similar to that on Earth. Robot rovers are also looking for the possibility of whether there is alien life there too. Sending humans to the planet could help speed up the research and allow us to better understand the history of Mars. Nasa are also curious to find out if studying Mars could help us find out more about our own planet, and even how our solar system was born. However Nasa could be pipped to the post in the race to Mars, as a non-profit organization based in the Netherlands has said they will land humans on Mars by 2027.	Nasa has revealed its plans to try to get humans living on Mars in the next few decades.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had earlier called for a "Day of Silence", to make a widely-violated ceasefire deal stick. New talks between the rebels and the government could take place in Belarus in the coming days. Russia has resumed gas supplies to Ukraine after months of tough talks. Ukrainian pipeline operator Ukrtransgaz says up to 43.5m cubic metres (1.5bn cu ft) will be imported daily, to prevent winter shortages. Ukraine has paid Russia's Gazprom $378m (Â£242m; â‚¬308m) in advance for December deliveries, officials say. Russia cut off Ukraine's gas in June as the conflict between the government in Kiev and the rebels in the east escalated. But a new gas deal was reached through EU mediation in October. Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Russia of supplying heavy weapons and troops to the rebels - something Moscow has repeatedly denied. The warring sides signed a truce in Minsk in September, but more than 1,000 people have been killed in fighting since then, the UN says. Some of the heaviest fighting has raged at Donetsk airport. The Ukrainian military said on Tuesday a ceasefire had begun in "all the positions of the anti-terrorist operation forces", Interfax Ukraine news agency reported. The pro-Russian separatists had also laid down their arms at 09:00 (07:00 GMT) across eastern Ukraine, Russia's Ria Novosti agency said. Mr Poroshenko said last week that troops would observe the Day of Silence on Tuesday to try to boost the peace deal. Since the conflict began in April, more than 4,300 people have died with almost one million displaced, the UN says. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says Kiev must not renege on a pledge to give "special status" to the rebel-held Donetsk and Luhansk areas in the east. Speaking to Russia's RIA Novosti news agency, he said Mr Poroshenko had called for that status to be cancelled - a move that would "only strengthen the distrust between the sides, complicating their already difficult dialogue". He also accused Kiev of blocking financial co-operation with the rebel-held areas. Authorities in Minsk said they had not received any confirmation that either the Ukrainian government or rebel representatives would attend new peace talks, which were planned to begin on Tuesday. Russian media reports say that the talks may now begin on Friday instead, but this has not been confirmed. The previous Minsk agreement, brokered in September, projected a 30km (18 mile) military buffer zone in the east and limited self-rule for the separatists. However, the rebels then held leadership elections on 2 November that Ukraine and the West refused to recognise. There have been near-daily clashes and exchanges of heavy weapons fire, leaving hundreds dead. Meanwhile, the last pieces of wreckage from Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, which was shot down over eastern Ukraine, have arrived in the Netherlands for investigation. Ukraine and its allies have accused Russia of supplying the missile used to bring down the plane, while Russia has denied involvement. A total of 298 people died when the plane came down in July. The Ukraine crisis began a year ago, when then-President Viktor Yanukovych abandoned an agreement on closer trade ties with EU in favour of closer co-operation with Russia. This decision sparked pro-EU protests in the capital Kiev, eventually toppling Mr Yanukovych in February. In the weeks that followed, Russia annexed Crimea, in Ukraine's south, and pro-Russian separatists took control of Donetsk and Luhansk, declaring independence. The crisis has caused a serious rift between Russia and Ukraine's Western supporters.	Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine are observing a ceasefire after weeks of bitter fighting, officials say.
They said this will amount to double the number of apprentices created each year - currently about 28,000. All parties are promising to create more apprentices or equivalent schemes to get unemployment down. Labour highlighted its pledge to create 100,000 additional apprentices. The Lib Dems said they would fund their promise by moving cash from Jobs Growth Wales, the Labour Welsh Government's existing job-creation scheme. Eluned Parrott, the Liberal Democrats' candidate for Cardiff Central, said: "Providing high-quality skills training is vital to boosting our economy and helping people to build careers and get on in life. "Labour's own evaluation report said that Jobs Growth Wales locked people into low wages and that 73% would've found work without it. "We all know this scheme is a failure, but Labour refuses to face the facts. "The Welsh Liberal Democrats would instead invest in apprenticeships and training, which will actually give young people professional skills and help them get on in life." On Labour's policy, Deputy Skills Minister Julie James said Wales already had "one of the best records in Europe" on apprenticeships. "This pledge is the next step to ensuring that we have the skills base that projects like Wylfa Newydd and the South Wales Metro, will demand," she said. "That is why so many voices within industry are so enthusiastic about this pledge." Plaid Cymru has promised to created 50,000 new apprentices, while the Welsh Conservatives say they will lift the current 16-24 age restrictions on the Jobs Growth Wales scheme. It helps firms employ 16-24-year-olds for six months by covering the cost of the minimum wage. The Tories aim to replace it with a scheme called Journeys to Work, open to all ages, with jobs lasting for a year. UKIP say they back industry-supported apprenticeships, along with more vocational options in post-14 education.	The Welsh Liberal Democrats would create 140,000 extra apprentices over the next five years if the party wins power in May's elections.
The 34-year-old's ban now expires on 1 June 2018, instead of 25 October 2018. He was banned in April after being charged with breaking FA rules for placing 1,260 bets on matches between 26 March 2006 and 13 May 2016. Barton, who says he is addicted to gambling, appealed against the length of the ban which he called "excessive". The FA's Appeal Board said the initial ban was "excessive in the circumstances" as evidence from Barton's consultant psychiatrist about his addiction should not have been rejected. The report says the new ban "reflects the overall seriousness of the breaches and also the mitigation including the full extent of Mr Barton's addiction". Barton, whose fine of £30,000 remained unchanged, was released from Burnley in May. Players in England's top eight tiers are banned from betting on football. Former Manchester City and Newcastle midfielder Barton rejoined Burnley in January, having left Scottish Premiership side Rangers in November. In November 2016, he was given a one-match ban for breaking Scottish Football Association rules on gambling. Barton admitted the Scottish FA charge of placing 44 bets between 1 July and 15 September 2016, while he was a player at Ibrox.	Former Burnley midfielder Joey Barton's suspension from football for breaching betting rules has been reduced by almost five months after an appeal.
He was seriously injured in a bomb attack in Afghanistan in 2006. Since carrying the torch on 26 June, Doncaster-based L/Bdr Parkinson has had thousands of requests on Facebook. But the site limits friend associations to 5,000 per personal page and he cannot accept all the requests. Flanked by hundreds of people, he walked for nearly half an hour with the Olympic torch with an assistant who supported his arm. L/Bdr Parkinson's nomination stated: "The brain injury took his speech, but not his personality and sense of humour," adding he now speaks unaided. It said: "Determined to prove everyone wrong, he fought back every step of the way. Ben's intelligence and wit [are] unchanged. Still the same funny and caring Ben." He spends 12 hours a day in the gym and rehab and walks with crutches, spending "the rest of his time spent raising money for many military charities and as patron of his beloved             Pilgrim Bandits ". L/Bdr Parkinson's mother Diane said the responses had "been phenomenal" and that Ben was really "buoyed up" by the support and friendship he had been shown. She said: "It's just unbelievable, Ben's had way over 5,000 friend requests but Facebook won't let him have more than that number. "Thousands of people have joined the Pilgrim Bandits website and the messages of support we've had are great. "Ben's page has had 19,000 hits just on an update, I don't understand how these things work, but it's phenomenal." She said the amount of post the family had received had also increased. She added: "Some mail has just been addressed to Ben, please Mr Postie. "E-mail traffic has gone through the roof and Ben's had hundreds of requests to visit places with the [Olympic] torch. "He's absolutely bouncing and buoyed up and elated." Facebook would not comment on the issue but their guidance was that if people were receiving this many requests then they have become a public figure, so should consider having a page instead of a profile. Alternatively, Ben could use subscribe so that people can see his public updates without actually becoming a friend. A total of 8,000 people will carry the flame during its 8,000 mile, 70-day journey to the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London on 27 July.	Injured paratrooper Ben Parkinson, who carried the Olympic flame, has been swamped with friend requests on social media and seen a huge increase in post addressed to "hero Ben".
Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Mrs May, who was home secretary before becoming PM, had allowed officer numbers to fall in recent years. The Conservatives said Ms Abbott had "dangerous" views on protecting the public. Armed police numbers have increased, a Conservative spokesman added. Following the London and Manchester terror attacks, security is featuring heavily in the final days of campaigning before Thursday's general election. Labour has been targeting cuts to the Home Office's policing budget - the Conservatives have rejected the criticism and a former terrorism law watchdog said linking the cuts to terror attacks was a "completely misleading argument". Speaking to the BBC, Ms Abbott said it was "concerning" that action was not taken when one of the London attackers - 27-year-old Khuram Butt - was known to the security services. She said this reinforced the need for an increase in community police officers. Latest figures show that between September 2010 and September 2016, police workforce numbers in England and Wales fell by 18,991, or 13%. Ms Abbott said police numbers had fallen "on Theresa May's watch" despite warnings from the Police Federation and HM Inspector of Constabulary. "So she should really consider how much of this goes back to her door and the decisions that she took," she said. Asked how much of a connection there was between Saturday's attack and the cuts to officer numbers, she added: "She does need to explain why she thought it appropriate to watch police numbers go down by 20,000 when she had so many warnings from so many people that this was putting people at risk. "Clearly the people responsible for these horrific terror attacks are the bloodthirsty and depraved terrorists but Theresa May has to take responsibility for letting austerity damage her ability to keep us safe." Speaking in a special general election edition of Question Time, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said cuts to police numbers had "not made us safer". But Lord Carlile, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, told the BBC cuts in community policing were "nothing to do with terrorism", saying "nobody in the security services is complaining about their funding" Following the London attack, Mrs May said "things need to change" in the fight against terrorism, calling for more to be done about online extremism and for a review into whether security services needed extra powers. Speaking to BBC Newsbeat, she defended her record, saying she had given the police extra powers to deal with terrorists and that there had been an increase in the number of people reporting suspected extremists to the authorities. The Conservatives described Labour's criticism as "desperate stuff", saying the security services had been boosted with extra officers. "Diane Abbott's views on keeping us safe are as dangerous as she is hopeless under pressure," a spokesman said, saying she had "voted against every piece of security legislation designed to keep us safe".	Labour has accused Theresa May of "letting austerity damage her ability to keep us safe" as it continues its attack over police cuts.
Miriam Briddon died after the collision involving her Fiat Punto and a Volkswagen Golf driven by Gareth Entwhistle near Ciliau Aeron. Entwhistle, 34, from the Aeron Valley, admitted causing death by careless driving while under the influence of alcohol on 29 March, 2014. He will appear again at Swansea Crown Court at the end of July. The crash victim was a former Ysgol Dyffryn Teifi pupil, described by her family as a "creative person who would be truly missed".	A Ceredigion man has pleaded guilty to drink-driving and causing a crash which killed a 21-year-old woman.
The 32-year-old was released by the Paisley club after making more than 330 appearances over two stints. "He's played at the highest level in Scotland and is top flight quality," manager Ian Murray told the club website. "A player of his calibre opting to join us is a very good sign." A League Cup winner with the Buddies in 2013, Van Zanten, who also had spells at Hibs, Morton and Hamilton, made 18 appearances last season. Van Zanten is the Championship club's second summer signing, following Scott Taggart's move from Morton.	Former St Mirren full-back David van Zanten has joined Dumbarton on a one-year deal, with the option of staying for a further 12 months.
Otters were declared extinct on the Japanese islands by its Ministry of the Environment in August 2012. The Skye-based International Otter Survival Fund (IOSF) has been helping with the reintroduction preparations. Dr Takahiro Murakami, who will lead the Japanese visit to Scotland, has never seen otters in the wild. The Japanese otter was believed to be either a subspecies of the Eurasian otter or possibly even a separate species. Conservationists have suggested reintroducing otters to Hokkaido, an island in north Japan. IOSF supports conservation projects across the world. It also rescues and raises orphaned otter cubs.	Conservationists are to visit Skye to learn more about otter habitats ahead of a proposed reintroduction of the mammals to Japan.
Wilson rejoined Championship side Forest from Celtic for £2.5m in August 2013, but has been without a team since being released in May.

The Kremlin's dreams of a US-Russian rapprochement under President Donald Trump were shattered by the American Tomahawk cruise missiles slamming into the Syrian air base. One might add another piece of advice: "Choose your allies carefully". It is an unexpected reversal of fortune for Russia and President Vladimir Putin. Only a few days ago US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that removing Syria's Bashar al-Assad from power was no longer Washington's priority. This was probably taken by the Syrian president as carte blanche to step up his attacks on the opposition. But the chemical attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun - believed to be the work of his forces - backfired. Even if one sets moral considerations apart (and this was a war crime, pure and simple), Moscow's credibility among the leading players in the region is dented now. Either: Moscow knew about the planned attack and condoned it - which means its co-sponsorship with the US of the 2013 Syrian chemical weapons liquidation deal was a ruse, a deception, and it therefore cannot be trusted; Or: the Assad regime deceived Russia and kept some of its chemical weapons (or production facilities) hidden, to use them at will. Then it means that the Kremlin has zero leverage on Damascus. In the hard-power world of the Middle East one doesn't know which outcome is more damaging for Russia. Two US destroyers casually launched 59 cruise missiles, worth nearly $1m (Â£m) each, just to make a political point. That underlines the discrepancy in financial and material resources between the US and Russia. Trump sends a resolute signal on Syria Dramatic turnaround for Trump Why was Syria's Shayrat airbase bombed? Six decisive points that changed Syria's war The fact that the Americans told Moscow in advance about the strike, to avoid casualties among Russian military personnel stationed on the airbase, only added insult to injury. The message was unmistakable: "Step aside please while we do our own thing here." The Trump administration is prepared to act unilaterally in the volatile region, where many are tired of Washington's eight years of inaction and long for a US "return". Donald Trump showed that he, unlike Barack Obama, is not only prepared to draw "red lines" but is also ready to punish those who cross them. Key American allies in the Middle East - Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Turkey - roundly praised his action. In the absence of a coherent policy by the Obama White House these states visibly moved towards strengthening ties with Moscow. However, in the last few weeks President Trump, Secretary of State Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis have held intensive talks with these countries to re-establish confidence in US policies. Probably the most unpleasant thing for Mr Putin is Turkey's approval of the US strikes. The Russian leader made a big personal effort to forge an alliance between Russia, Iran and Turkey, to help impose the Russian vision of future Syrian conflict resolution, which would keep the Assad regime intact. Now it looks as if Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has started playing a different game. President Trump said he took the decision to launch a strike based on humanitarian grounds, after seeing images of gassed children. Whether it is true or not, such an attitude will earn him support in Europe, where such considerations are important. That's bad news for Moscow. Mr Putin doesn't like - and doesn't know how to talk about  - "values". He prefers "interests". Although the White House said the strikes were a "one-off" action it looks as if a full-scale return of the United States to the Middle East is being considered by Mr Trump and his top advisers. It doesn't look like the White House will consult the Kremlin about the terms of this return. Moreover, it seems very likely that putting pressure on Russia's top ally Iran may be next on the cards for Washington. Domestically the Kremlin will redouble propaganda efforts by its massive state TV machine to convince the population that Russia is in the right and that the Americans are once again out to get it. Presidential elections are due in 2018 in Russia. In Mr Putin's view, nothing works as well as anti-Americanism and great power rhetoric to mobilise the electorate. For the US and Middle East the Kremlin will most likely adopt the old Soviet-style policy of mixing threats with softer language, hoping to reach an accommodation that could be presented domestically as a "victory". It did work with the Obama White House. It might not with the Trump administration. After all, no one promised that "making America great again" would mean sharing that greatness with others.

Media playback is not supported on this device The 23-year-old earned GB's second medal of the Hong Kong championships following Elinor Barker's silver medal in the women's scratch on Wednesday. Latham emerged from the pack to take bronze as he chased down Adrian Teklinski of Poland, who won gold, and Lucass Liss of Germany, who got silver. In the men's team pursuit, GB were beaten to the bronze medal by Italy. Media playback is not supported on this device "I am really happy to come away with a medal, finally," Latham told the BBC. "I wasn't sure that Teklinski was going to hold on there. "I was in a decent position most of the time. I followed the Irish rider Felix English and I had a good lead out." Elsewhere Britain's sole rider in the men's keirin, Joe Truman, was outclassed in his semi-final, having tried to take the race out with two laps to go. And in the women's team pursuit, GB finished fifth in the heats and failed to make the bronze-medal ride. Olympic gold medallist Chris Boardman "Latham had a fantastic final charge. He timed his effort well there. "We hardly saw him in the race, he monitored things but that's why. He was waiting for that final sprint. And what a ride that was for him. "But with three laps to go, I would not have said that Teklinski would make it, but he found something from somewhere to just hang on there. "More than 2km out, he effectively started to sprint. It will take him some time to recover from that." Six-time Olympic gold medallist Sir Chris Hoy "I don't think that would be expected. It's the kind of event you can never be super-confident of winning or winning a medal in. "But if you ride sensibly, which he did, he positioned himself very well and didn't waste any energy in the first part of the race. "He marked the danger men and clearly had the legs for the sprint at the end. That's fantastic, a really great result for him and the team." Team pursuit Olympic gold medallist Elinor Barker came into the quartet of Emily Nelson, Manon Lloyd and Ellie Dickinson. The young squad were unable to compete for a medal but Barker remained positive about their progress. She told the BBC: "It's the first Worlds for all of these girls and it's made it a lot more exciting. "The level is so high already physically and technically. We have so much scope for improvement. It's such a good place to be in. "Four years until Tokyo and we've just come fifth at the Worlds." Double Olympic gold medallist Joanna Rowsell Shand said on BBC TV: "Coming into the competition, I don't think anyone expected them to medal. "Until Elinor Barker joined the team today, we had four brand new riders. With an average age of 19, they've all got bright futures ahead of them." Earlier in the day, Olympic bronze medallist Katy Marchant was eliminated from the women's sprint in the first round. The 24-year-old, who claimed bronze behind Kristina Vogel of Germany and fellow Briton Becky James at Rio 2016, was the only female sprinter to travel to Hong Kong. The former heptathlete qualified in 16th place but was ousted by 17th-fastest Lin Junhong of China earlier on Thursday. Marchant is scheduled to compete in two more events - Saturday's 500m time-trial and Sunday's keirin. "I'm really disappointed. I feel like I'm just missing a little bit of zing, which is something that coming off Rio is to be expected," she said. "I didn't get the roar when I got the number on my back today - maybe the fact it's not an Olympic Games or something in the back of my mind telling me that I'm not feeling great. "I know to get knocked out in the first round is not what we expect from a medallist, but the preparation coming into this competition is about the process leading on to Tokyo."

From music festivals to corporate expos, trade fairs to charity auctions, we spend about £375bn a year on events worldwide - £40bn of that in the UK. It seems we gregarious humans still love to press the flesh, chat in person and see things for ourselves, despite the availability of online collaboration tools, teleconferencing and email. And technology is "transforming the meetings and events space," says Mr Aggarwal. "It's a market ripe for automation." Going digital has enabled organisers to send out invitations via social media, email and mobile, and provide attendees with a more integrated registration, travel and hotel booking experience. "We've seen two major changes in the space since we started [in 2006]," says Renaud Visage, co-founder of San Francisco-based Eventbrite, a tech firm that offers an events organising platform. "Social media, which is very important for marketing, and mobile, which can be used for event apps and for checking-in attendees." The company has grown fast, processing about $3bn (£2bn) worth of tickets and powering a million events last year, says Mr Visage. Innovations include dynamic pricing for online seat reservations, depending on where they are in the venue, and the ability to sell merchandise around the event as well. One company benefiting from event technology is Children's Inn, a charity providing accommodation for kids suffering from the rarest forms of disease. Lauren Stabart, assistant director of corporate giving and special events, told the BBC: "Our service costs millions of dollars a year to run, so raising money from sponsors and ticketed events is essential for our survival. "Cvent helped set up our webpage event management platform, where people can purchase tickets and we can offer special promotions, discounts and so on. "Moving from paper-based registration to digital - checking people into events on tablets - was just so seamless and easy," she says. Organisers' guest lists are updated automatically so everyone has access to the same information on their hand-held devices. Technology is also helping to make the events more interactive, she says, with features like "social wall", which projects live tweets onto a wall for guests to read during the event. Since it was founded in 1990, the charity, based in Bethesda, Maryland, has given a temporary home to about 13,000 seriously ill children and their families. Now when you go to a big conference the prospectus and schedule is likely to be included in a dedicated app, perhaps incorporating video content of the presentations and an interactive map of the venue. A company like Eventbase, which developed apps for the 2012 London Olympics and the US South by South West (SXSW) music, film and technology festival, specialises in creating these bespoke apps. At this year's SXSW more than 1,000 iBeacons were installed around the venue. These small devices communicated with Eventbase's smartphone app to establish visitors' exact locations. This enabled anyone who opted in to the service be found by other visitors - useful for networking and socialising. If you missed a speech because you were too busy networking or sampling the refreshments, a well-run event will upload it to the app soon after. "If I hear a great speaker I want to be able to share the recording five minutes later, not two weeks later," says Mr Aggarwal, whose company services 13,000 clients worldwide, including companies like Roche, Rolls-Royce and Yale University. "With easy access to all the presentations, the event extends beyond the weekend and the content lives longer." Event apps and location technology also make it easier for brands to showcase their wares online as well as in the venue, and to target certain visitors with specific messages as they move around. This targeting is helped by visitors detailing their preferences and areas of interest when they register online for the event. With about 20 million events happening each year, but only 50,000 currently offering attendees an in-conference app, according to industry estimates, this a rich area for growth for tech companies. Within the venue, internet-connected devices, such as tablets and smartphones, can make for a more interactive relationship with visitors. Live polling can enliven a presentation, say, and interactive bidding at charity events using technology from the likes of iBid, can help raise more money. Bidders can see the latest bids on a large digital screen, adding to the excitement and the spirit of competition. Nowadays events also encourage tweets and social media updates from visitors which are then projected onto "social walls" around the venue. Mr Aggarwal envisages quadcopter drones buzzing round fulfilling this function in future. And more often, attendee passes and wristbands have RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technology built in, so you can log in to interactive displays or register for offers with a simple wave or tap of your device. Mr Visage believes connected wristbands will also act as digital wallets, allowing festival goers to pay for food, drink and merchandise so they don't have to worry about losing payment cards and cash. Technology is also playing an increasingly important role in brand marketing at events, where competition for visitors' attention is fierce. Product displays are integrating voice, face and gesture activation technologies to make them more fun and interactive, says Nick Thompson, founding partner of Knit, a UK technology design company. His firm has developed Twitter-activated jukeboxes, LED light displays activated by sound and gesture, and social media integration with NFC-enabled wrist bands, amongst other digital delights. Virtual reality (VR) headsets will be the next trend at events, he believes. "At some automotive shows this year there have been more VR headsets than cars," he says. "Immersive content is going to play a huge role in how brands engage consumers in brand experiences." Some thought digital technology would kill the live event. Instead, it seems to have given it a new lease of life.

Sterling did subsequently recover some of the losses. But there is certainly a view that the currency would decline if Britain were to decide to leave. Some analysts expect the fall in the value of sterling in the event of a Brexit vote would be very sharp . The concern reflects the view held by many - though by no means all - economists that leaving the EU would undermine the UK's economic performance. How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU. There would be a period of uncertainty about access to the EU market for British exporters while new arrangements were negotiated. The ultimate result could be that it would be harder to sell to the EU market. It is argued that foreign investment could be hit by the uncertainty. This would be going on at a time when the UK has a large deficit in what is called "the current account deficit" - which is trade in goods and services plus some international financial transactions. The deficit has to be financed by loans and foreign investment in financial assets. Unease about the economic outlook could mean that foreign investors would only provide the finance for the deficit if sterling were cheaper. There is of course another view, reflected by Economists for Brexit that the UK would prosper outside the EU. For the short term however, it is more likely to be the majority view that moves markets and sterling in particular. Our reporting on the currency markets usually focuses on what's called the spot rates, the exchange rate that an investor pays to buy currency immediately. But they can also buy options, which are rights to buy or sell a currency (or other types of financial asset) in the future at a price fixed in advance. It's a way of getting insurance against a move in the exchange rate. If the move you are worried about doesn't happen you don't exercise the option. So you are insured, but you have had to pay for it. That part of the market suggests that investors do think a leave vote would weaken sterling. That was the message that the Bank of England Governor Mark Carney gave to a parliamentary committee back in March, in rather technical language: "We have seen a marked increase in implied volatility in the options market around the date of the referendum, once the date became known, and the skews in the option market, in other words the purchase of downside protection if the pound was going to depreciate, had gone up quite sharply." In other words, more investors were buying insurance for the time of the referendum against a fall in the pound than a rise. The Bank also says that about half the decline in sterling since November is due to news related to the referendum. Here's another sign. The financial news service Bloomberg calculates what it calls "implied volatility" from the options market. It shows a marked increase for the pound against the dollar as the referendum approaches. John Redwood the Conservative MP and Brexit supporter looks at the sterling issue rather differently. He wrote in his blog: "The pound fell from over $2 in 2008 to $1.4 in 2009 when we were firmly committed to the EU, so we know other influences can generate large sterling movements". And it must be said that Mark Carney fully recognises other factors have influenced sterling in recent months. On the current account issue, Mr Redwood argues that the immediate impact would be beneficial: "The first round effect is to improve the balance of payments by on fifth as we cancel the payments we have to make to the rest of the EU which we do not get back." The leading Brexit campaigner Boris Johnson also rejects the concerns about the impact on the pound from a leave vote:  "The pound will go where it will over the short term. But, believe me, in the long term you can look forward to fantastic success for this countryâ€¦ I think the pound's value will depend entirely on the strength of the UK economy." It's also worth pointing out that a weaker pound now could be helpful to the British economy. It improves the competitiveness of British industry. It makes imported goods more expensive boosting inflation. Normally that would be unwelcome, but not at a time when inflation is well below the Bank of England's target.	The pound has weakened after new polls suggested an increased chance of a vote in the referendum to leave the European Union.
The hosts scored a brilliant first-half try and had the Scots under severe pressure at times after the interval. But from 16-9 down, four penalties from Greig Laidlaw - who had come on for Henry Pyrgos - saw the visitors home. "If we can have frustrating days and a win at the end of them all the time, I will be happy," Cotter said. "It was a game that in the context of the end of a season and a long year, to get the win, to grind it out, I am happy. "I am happy with the character, the way the team applied pressure and finally got the result. It could have gone the other way. "We weathered a very difficult first half, they flew into us and lifted the intensity from last week, we felt that. It took us a while to wear them down, but we are happy with the result. "No coach is ever going to be totally happy and I know we will find parts we need to improve on. It will be a focus next time we come together." Assistant coach Jonathan Humphreys praised the impact of replacement front-rowers Gordon Reid, Fraser Brown and WP Nel, who came on together for the second half in place of Rory Sutherland, Stuart McInally and Moray Low, and earned Scotland some scrum dominance. "I thought they were excellent," Humphreys told BBC Scotland.  "We wanted some energy and they certainly gave us that. "We had to change things up, we were probably over-playing a bit in the first half.  We decided to make it a bit more conservative and try to force them into some errors. "It was probably a game we would have lost just over 12 months ago. The character we showed was fantastic - five metres from our own line, defending 13 or 14 phases, and we managed to keep them out." Media playback is not supported on this device Defeated Japan coach Mark Hammett believes Scotland were allowed to get away with slowing the ball down without punishment during a vital period of the second half. "I'm really, really proud of the effort. We witnessed a really outstanding game here in Tokyo," he said. "I don't think the best team won and even talking to the Scottish coaches, they agree. We are obviously very, very disappointed. "I feel that perhaps the last two Tests we have been slightly disrespected as a team and what we can achieve. In all that attack, particularly in the second half, we did not get the reward. "There was obviously a reason the ball was being slowed down. We worked really hard for that but did not get the outcome we believe we should have had."	Scotland head coach Vern Cotter praised the character of his side to "grind out" their 21-16 win over Japan despite an underwhelming performance in Tokyo.
The annual Bank of Scotland Business Digital Index assessed small firms in five key skills needed to get the most out of being online. It found that fewer than a third of small businesses north of the border lacked these basic skills. This compares to a UK average of 38%. Only London rivals Scotland in terms of this measure. Experts said the lack of key digital skills was a primary barrier to doing more business online, with 15% of firms across the UK stating this was the main barrier, more than doubling since 2015. The skills assessed for the current report were managing information, communicating, transacting, creating and problem solving. The report also noted cyber security was rising in prominence as a reason for small businesses not doing more online. Almost 60% of Scottish firms said they still needed to invest in cyber security, lower than the UK average of 69%. Philip Grant, chair of the bank's Scottish executive committee, said: "It's pleasing to see that the Business Digital Index shows digital maturity is increasing for small businesses in Scotland, however, there are still too many without basic digital skills. "It's clear that being online can open the doors to opportunities, as well as cost and time saving benefits. "We must do more to encourage small businesses based in Scotland to invest in digital skills, allowing them to make the most out of being online and to reap the benefits." Two thousand businesses and charities across the UK were surveyed, including 109 in Scotland. The study was developed along with Doteveryone and Accenture.	Small businesses in Scotland are leading the way when it comes to digital skills, according to a study.
Officers were alerted to the find just south of Porth Neigwl (Hell's Mouth), near Abersoch on the Llyn Peninsula, at about 16:00 GMT on Sunday. Police and members of the coastguard placed a 100m (330ft) cordon around the object. The Ministry of Defence confirmed it was possibly some kind of ordnance. Explosive experts are set to detonate the device on Monday morning to make it safe.	Part of a Gwynedd beach has been closed after a member of the public found a suspected explosive device, North Wales Police has said.
Instead, it was her namesake, Irish politician Joan Collins, who was arrested at a protest against new water meters in Dublin yesterday. The former Dynasty star tweeted: 'No I am not the Joan Collins Who was a rested (sic) yesterday At a Dublin protest meeting !!! The very idea !!" United Left TD Ms Collins said she was taking part in a "peaceful protest". She later tweeted that she should not be confused with the British screen icon. "For the record I'm not @JoanCollinsOBE as I'd never take an honour from a monarch nor did I wear shoulder pads in the 80s. The very idea!" Veteran actress Joan, 81, was made a dame in the Queen's New Year's honours list last year. She is famous for her roles in films like The Stud and The Bitch, and more recently starred in the TV series The Royals. She was previously a patron of UKIP, but said that does not mean she would vote for them, and has declared herself an admirer of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Irish parliamentarian Ms Collins sits on the opposite end of the political spectrum. She was among 13 people arrested at the demonstration, which was part of continuing protests against the introduction of water charges in Ireland.	Actress Joan Collins has taken to Twitter to deny that she was arrested in the Republic of Ireland.
The 21-year-old told BBC Sport last year that he was considering an approach from Algeria. The Lille striker was born in France and played for them at every youth level from under-16 but is eligible for Algeria through his parents. The Algeria Football Federation said it "will immediately begin the process of registering the player with Fifa." The federation added Benzia met its president Mohamed Raouraoua this week to finalise his choice to play for the Desert Foxes. Even though Fifa is yet to receive Benzia's request for a switch of nationality, the Algerian football authority is confident of a swift approval by the game's governing body. Benzia has scored 26 goals in 43 appearances during his time playing for France's youth teams. His capture will come as a morale boost for Algeria after they were snubbed by Lyon striker Nabil Fekir last year. Benzia started his career at Lyon where he progressed from the academy to the senior squad and made his senior debut against Nice in May 2012. He switched to Ligue 1 rivals Lille in August 2015 in search of regular football and has already scored five goals in 20 appearances for the club this season.	Former France youth international striker Yassine Benzia has pledged his senior future to Algeria.
Kevin Hurley, Surrey Police and Crime Commissioner, said he had considered seeking her dismissal before she took over the national policing role. Concerns about public protection and child safeguarding in Surrey were down to a "failure of leadership", he said. Mrs Owens said she underwent a "lengthy and thorough" NCA interview process. The Home Office said she was an "exceptional" policing leader. Last November, Mrs Owens, 47, saw off strong competition to be named director-general of the National Crime Agency - one of the most prestigious and highly paid roles in policing. The NCA has responsibility for the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre - known as CEOP. But in the months leading up to her appointment, Mrs Owens's record on child protection had been brought into question by Mr Hurley. Highly critical inspection reports of the force had led Mr Hurley to declare that he had lost confidence in Mrs Owens and was considering starting the formal process - known as Section 38 - that could have led to her dismissal. Criticisms included the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) finding failings in the way the Surrey force had handled the case of 14-year-old Breck Bednar, who was groomed online before being murdered. Mr Hurley had previously been a supporter of his chief constable, extending her contract in 2012 and writing to Home Secretary Theresa May in 2014 to say she had had an "outstanding year". But during the 12 months leading up to November 2015, all that had changed. Emails and documents disclosed to BBC News under the Freedom of Information Act show that over this period, Mr Hurley's confidence in the chief constable's ability to deal with the problems ebbed away. The minutes of a public protection scrutiny meeting on 3 September reveal the PCC's concerns about the force's handling of rape, domestic abuse and female genital mutilation cases - as well as child protection. In September, Mr Hurley wrote a stinging 10-page letter to Mrs Owens saying he held her "personally responsible". He accused her of blaming others for the "litany of failures", claiming it was "an example of moral cowardice". He wrote: "You have failed to act decisively or speedily to address many areas of concern in relation to public protection." Mrs Owens has told the BBC these comments were "ill-considered and inaccurate". Mr Hurley delivered the letter to Mrs Owens at a meeting, during which she declared that she was applying for the NCA post. At the same meeting, Mr Hurley revealed he had been considering starting the formal process that could lead to Mrs Owens being dismissed or having to resign from the force. Mr Hurley then wrote to Sir Tom Winsor, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary for England and Wales, stating concerns that Surrey Police was "failing vulnerable children, rape and domestic violence victims" and asking for assistance. Mrs Owens issued a detailed 19-page rebuttal of the PCC's accusations, saying her 26-year police record was "unblemished" and that she had taken "immediate and muscular" action in response to child protection concerns. But in October, Mr Hurley wrote again to Sir Tom, saying: "I have lost confidence in the chief constable's ability to lead the necessary cultural changes and cannot be sure that, under her command, the threat, risk and harm of public protection-related issues will be properly addressed." Mr Hurley has said he was not asked about Mrs Owens's suitability for the NCA position, and only found out about her new job by a message posted by a journalist on social media. He said that had Mrs Owens not been appointed he would have started the formal dismissal process. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "It is a failure of leadership. The chief constable is the leader. She has let down the constables and sergeants, but more importantly she has let down our most vulnerable victims across the county." The Inspectorate of Constabulary said it had briefed senior officials at the Home Office concerning the inspection work at Surrey, the "nature of the correspondence" from Mr Hurley and discussed the NCA appointment with them. However, it is understood that another inspectorate report, which is due to be published in the coming weeks, is expected to conclude that the force lacks understanding of serious and organised crime groups in Surrey and "requires improvement" in the way it deals with the problem. Mrs Owens said: "I was selected to my current role by the home secretary after a lengthy and thorough process and am now focused on leading the National Crime Agency in its fight to cut serious and organised crime." The Home Office said Mrs Owens was "one of the exceptional policing leaders of her generation". Officials pointed out that she went through a rigorous recruitment and selection process that included a "testing" panel interview. It said professional references and due diligence checks were also undertaken.	New National Crime Agency head Lynne Owens was appointed amid concerns about her performance as chief constable of Surrey Police, the BBC has learned.
He said the Bank took "timely, comprehensive and concrete" action, which acted to "support, cushion and help the economy to adjust". Last month's rate cut to an historic low of 0.25% helped support house prices and the wider economy, he added. He added he was "absolutely serene" about the Bank's preparations for the impact from the Brexit vote. Mr Carney was being questioned by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee about how the Bank handled the referendum outcome and its decision to cut interest rates to a record low. The Bank was criticised by Brexit supporters for saying the economy would be hit from a vote to leave the EU. But Mr Carney said the Bank's decisions had so far been "validated". The "extraordinary preparations" made by the Bank "cushioned" the economy and will help the UK "make a success of Brexit", he told MPs on the Treasury Select Committee. He said the Bank's actions were made in an effort "to help make the leaving of the EU a success as quickly as possible". "This financial system, under the oversight of the Bank of England, sailed through what was a surprise to the vast majority of financial market participants," Mr Carney said. MPs questioned whether the Bank was too aggressive in supporting the economy after the vote. The UK's services, manufacturing and construction industries have all showed signs of recovery in August after taking a hit in July. However, Mr Carney said he was "absolutely comfortable" with the Bank's decision to cut interest rates to 0.25% and pump billions of pounds into the economy. He added that it is "welcome there is a rebound" in the economy. Mr Carney said there has been quite a considerable improvement in mortgage borrowing costs "and we are seeing pass through of our actions". When Labour MP Rachel Reeves raised concerns that the majority of lenders had yet to pass on the full cut in rates, Mr Carney said the Bank expected "virtually" all the rate cut to be passed on to borrowers in the next few months.	Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has defended his action to mitigate the impact of Brexit.
We've learned a lot about the end of the journey, the slave camps and mass graves in the jungles of Thailand and Malaysia. What we haven't heard so much about is how these journeys begin. We travelled to southern Bangladesh, where many of the migrants set off on their perilous voyages. What we have discovered brings a shocking new dimension to this story that speaks of the terrible desperation that is driving this vast movement of people. We met one of the people smugglers on what Bangladeshis proudly boast is the world's longest beach - a vast stretch of sand that runs for more than 120km along the southern coast. Let's call him Kamrul Rahman. He appeared to be in his early 30s.  He said he used to be a fisherman and started in the people smuggling racket greedy for money after his business went belly up. As the surf crashed down on the beach beside us, he calmly explained in chilling detail how the business worked. He said the prison camps were an essential part of the business model and all the migrants knew about them. It seems they are part of what amounts to a sinister and hideously cynical marketing trick the people smugglers have evolved: they offer the voyage for virtually no upfront cost. He said the deal was straightforward and understood by everyone involved. You only pay the main charge - about Â£1,500 ($2,300) when you arrive in southern Thailand. I was amazed. "So the migrants know they will be held in camp before they get to Malaysia?" I asked. "Before they leave from here we tell them if they don't pay they will be put in a prison. You won't get any rice and you will die of hunger", he told me, without any sign of emotion. "If you pay, you will be able to start for Malaysia with honour." We spoke to many migrants and relatives of migrants in southern Bangladesh. They all confirmed his account. Without exception, they said they knew migrants would be held in Thailand until full payment was made. What this suggests is that for the most part this phenomenon isn't strictly human trafficking - where people are bought and sold against their will - but rather a perverted business transaction to which most of the migrants and their families are actually party. The so-called "ransoms" migrants who have been rescued from the camps in Thailand say their captors are actually part of the deal they sign up to when they make the journey. Take a moment now to think about what that tells us about the people who make these journeys. They are so desperate for a better life that they are willing to go with the people smugglers even though they know that they may end up starving to death in a jungle prison camp. Stina Ljungdell, the UN refugee agency representative in Bangladesh, agrees that many migrants do know what they are getting into. If you think about it objectively, it makes a kind of sick business sense for both the smugglers and their customers. The migrants are assured that they only pay the full cost if they actually arrive in Thailand - cash on delivery, if you like. Meanwhile, the smugglers have leverage to guarantee that they get paid. The model has the added advantage, from the perspective of the smugglers at least, of making the decision to attempt the trip much easier. It seems many young men, and it is predominantly young men who seem to make the journey, are lured in the risky and selfish hope that their family will find a way raise the money once they arrive in Thailand. But other migrants make the decision to leave together with their families, judging that it is the only way to lift them out of poverty. We were told that a successful migrant can send as much as 30,000 taka (Â£260/$400) back to his family each month. But many, many migrants don't make it. Within minutes of arriving in an unofficial camp for Rohingya refugees further up the coast, I was surrounded by parents showing me pictures of their missing sons (and occasionally daughters). Some said their sons had left for Malaysia without telling them. Many others, however, said they had sent them off in the hope that they would send money back for the family. According to the smuggler, one in five of the migrants he takes don't make it to Malaysia. Many die before they even reach the camps, he told me. "Some die because of the suffering, some die because of of tension, some die thinking about how to escape from the situation and some people die of hunger after they run out of food. "All people have to die", he said, "that is fate."	Over the last couple of weeks, the world has woken up to the horrific trade in human beings being conducted in the seas of South East Asia.
Media playback is not supported on this device First or minor offences will result in either a warning, fine or order for a match to be played behind closed doors. Serious or repeat offences can now be punished by a points deduction, expulsion or relegation. Jeffrey Webb, head of Fifa's anti-racism task force, said the decision was "a defining moment". He added: "Our football family is fully aware that what is reported in the media is actually less than 1% of the incidents that happen around the world. "We've got to take action so that when we look to the next 20 or 50 years this will be the defining time that we took action against racism and discrimination." Fifa, world football's governing body, passed the anti-racism resolution with a 99% majority at its congress in Mauritius. Richard Conway, reporting for BBC Sport at the congress, said a concern was raised over those who voted against the tougher racism measures. "Former South African apartheid prisoner Tokyo Sexwale, now a Fifa member, urged congress to check cameras to see who voted against racism rules," he said. "Sexwale says (the) 1% vote against demonstrates how football still has to fight against racism." Webb said of the vote against the measures: "I would like to think it was a mistake but I'm glad it wasn't the other way. I'm glad only 1% went that way." Nonetheless, Fifa president Blatter accepted more must be done to eradicate racism. He said: "We need zero tolerance and strict punishments everywhere. We must lead. We must set a tough, uncompromising example. "We can make a difference. We can send a strong signal to the racists that their time is up." Fifa commissioned a task force to address the issue of racism after a friendly game between AC Milan and Pro Patria was abandoned due to racist chanting. Their verdict includes putting an official inside the stadium to identify potential acts of racism and ease the pressure on the match referee. The new rulings standardise punishment across the members, meaning federations will lose the power to impose their own judgements. Further to the regulations that relate to clubs or international teams, the new measures will see any individual who commits a racist offence banned from stadiums for a minimum of five matches. The five-match suspension is one that has been introduced by the Football Association, whose chairman David Bernstein sat on the task force in Mauritius. Also on the task force was Kevin-Prince Boateng, the AC Milan player who led the walk-off in the game against Pro Patria in January. Former England international striker Luther Blissett, an ambassador for anti-racism charity Show Racism The Red Card, admitted to reservations about the new measures. "You've got to applaud them for doing something about it, my thing is when they talk about the 'level' of racism," he told Radio 5 live. "To me, racism is racism. "Fifa have to let it be known where they are going to start this from. Any form of racism is serious enough for the bans to start, they should hit people hard straight away."	Teams could be relegated or expelled from competitions for serious incidents of racism after tough new powers were voted in by Fifa.
His brother Glyn confirmed the death on Twitter, saying his "big brother and hero" had died in New York City. Dillon was a prolific artist who began professional work at age 16, drawing for Marvel UK's Hulk magazine. He was best known for his US collaborations with writer Garth Ennis, creating classic cult comic titles. In his Twitter profile, Dillon, originally from Luton, describes himself as: "A comic book bloke. Co-creator/Artist of Preacher. Co-founder/Editor of Deadline magazine. Artist on Punisher, Judge Dredd and many others." He was born in Luton in Bedfordshire in 1962. When he was 16 he embarked on his first professional job, drawing the character Nick Fury for Hulk Weekly. In the 1980s his career started to take off and he regularly contributed to Doctor Who Magazine, creating the character Abslom Daak. More work followed and he was on the comic anthology Warrior from its inception in 1982. He also drew for the British sci-fi and fantasy comic 2000AD, where he was perhaps best-known for his work as an artist on Judge Dredd. Dillon arrived in the United States in the late 1980s, where some of his most popular strips were created. The Hollywood Reporter says it was at DC's Vertigo imprint that he collaborated with author Garth Ennis, first on the critically acclaimed Hellblazer and then on Preacher. Vertigo Comics paid tribute on Twitter, saying: "We lost a giant among creators and artists today. He will be missed by all of us here." The Preacher strip inspired the US television series of the same name. In a statement, TV company AMC said: "Steve Dillon was an enormously talented illustrator who, with Garth Ennis, created a cult classic comic we were so proud to bring to television." Dillon and Ennis then worked together on multiple series of the Punisher at Marvel, who have described the artist as "a great storyteller" on Twitter, and said they will remember his "incredible work". On his blog of British comics, Lew Stringer who describes himself as one of Dillon's "legions of fans", paid tribute, saying he had: "A natural talent for drawing pages that were easy on the eye and told the story superbly with a fantastic drawing ability."	Steve Dillon, the legendary British comic book artist, known for his work on Preacher, Punisher, and 2000AD's Judge Dredd has died aged 54.
Bangladesh police are investigating the murder of an Italian aid worker who was shot on Monday, with the Islamic State group saying it is responsible. The two-Test series was due to begin in Chittagong on Friday, 9 October. "One man gets killed, an Italian, and the tour is off. We've had 50,000 people killed in Pakistan," Khan said. Khan was referring to figures estimating the number of "fatalities in terrorist violence" in Pakistan since 2003. In May, Pakistan hosted their first home full international fixture since gunmen attacked a bus carrying the Sri Lanka team on its way to play in Lahore in 2009. "A certain amount of tension is likely through terrorism, but they have to trust the Bangladeshis, the Indians, the Sri Lankans and Pakistanis. We give them 100% protection," Khan added. "Some of the countries, like Australia and New Zealand, are perhaps oversensitive." Cricket Australia had initially delayed the team's scheduled departure on 28 September while it worked on a "revised security plan". But it now says that official advice means it had "no alternative but to postpone the tour". The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said it was "disappointed" by the decision but is "committed to rescheduling the series at a later date". On Wednesday, the BCB had promised "VVIP" treatment for the Australian team, saying they would be given the same level of security afforded to visiting heads of state. England are due to tour Bangladesh to play two Tests and three one-day internationals in October and November 2016.	Australia were "overly sensitive" to postpone their tour of Bangladesh over security concerns, says Pakistan Cricket Board president Shahryar Khan.
The judge described the evidence against Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly as overwhelming. The action was taken by the victims' families, who have been awarded £1.6m damages. Twenty-nine people, including a woman pregnant with twins, were killed in the Real IRA attack on the County Tyrone town in August 1998. Delivering his summary, Mr Justice Gillen recognised the scale of the terrorist outrage for which no one has ever been convicted. "The barrier of time has not served to disguise the enormity of this crime, the wickedness of its perpetrators and the grief of those who must bear its consequences," he said. "Even 15 years on nothing can dilute the pulsing horror of what happened." Lord Brennan QC, who represented the families, said the bereaved relatives were determined that the damages would be paid. "Enforcement will be pursued with vigour here and in other relevant jurisdictions," he said. Michael Gallagher, whose son Aidan was killed in the bombing, described it as an "important judgement". "We will be pursuing the judgement because it would be a very hollow judgement if it was merely words," he said. "We will be doing our best to try and recover the damages but at the moment, we're just happy that we've got a judgement that we, the families, the victims, have held someone to account for what happened at Omagh." During the retrial it was claimed that Colm Murphy supplied mobile phones to the bomb team. Mr Justice Gillen said there was compelling circumstantial evidence that two phones linked to Colm Murphy were used in the attack, with anyone who knowingly provided them to the bomb team liable. The builder's denials about lending his phone to anyone and subsequent explanation to police in the Irish Republic were wholly implausible and amounted to lies with no innocent explanation, according to the judge. The coincidence of a similar unexplained use by the same phone in an earlier bombing in Banbridge was found to amount to further probative evidence of Murphy's involvement in the Omagh operation. "To suggest that for a second time his phone had been mysteriously used without his knowledge moves one into the realm of fantasy," Mr Justice Gillen said. He described Mr Murphy's explanation for failing to give evidence as being due to his lack of confidence in the judicial system as "bordering on the risible". "It makes the prima facie case even stronger and renders it now overwhelming," he added. The same verdict was returned against Seamus Daly, based on his conversation on one of the bomb-run phones less than an hour after the explosion. Mr Daly's guilty plea and conviction for Real IRA membership in November 2000 was also taken into account. "This was relevant not just to propensity but was logically probative in determining the issue of liability in this case," Mr Justice Gillen said. Neither man was at the High Court in Belfast to hear the 73-page judgement. "I have determined that both defendants were involved in assisting the preparation, planting and detonation of the bomb," Mr Justice Gillen said. Stanley McCombe, who lost his wife Ann in the atrocity, said he hoped the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Garda Siochana in the Republic would now review the evidence following the verdict. "Out of all this, what we have heard from the judge, I think the Gardai, PSNI, and the bodies that be, have to really look at all this information and all this evidence and see if there is a case that these people have to answer for," he said. Mr Gallagher said the Omagh families would be seeking an "early meeting" with the PSNI chief constable, Matt Baggott. "We believe it's important that he looks at the judgement that was delivered, that there could be the possibility of pursuing the individuals that we have held to account in a criminal court," he said. "We just cannot accept that 31 people can be murdered and no-one can be brought to justice for that crime." Following the verdict, Lord Brennan QC, said he wanted the nine-year-long legal battle brought to an end. Opposing a stay on the judgment pending any further challenge, the barrister described the verdict against Mr Murphy and Mr Daly as "damning". "The prospects on appeal are, in our submission, zero," he said. "The defendants have had their full measure of legal aid and the ability to participate in this trial. Let it come to an end." The barrister also confirmed plans to pursue all four men now held liable for the bombing. To date, no-one has been successfully criminally prosecuted for the bombing. In the absence of criminal convictions, the victims' families took a landmark civil action, seeking damages from the men they believed were responsible. The retrial followed the original Omagh bomb civil case, which is believed to be the first time anywhere in the world that alleged members of a terrorist organisation have been sued. The first trial concluded in June 2009, when a judge ruled that four men - Real IRA leader Michael McKevitt, Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly - were all responsible for carrying out the atrocity. The 12 relatives who had taken the action were awarded more than £1.6m in damages. Mr McCombe said the families had not received "one single penny" from that judgement. However, the four men who were found liable subsequently launched appeals. Michael McKevitt and Liam Campbell failed to have the civil judgement against them overturned two years later. Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly were successful in upholding their appeals in July 2011, but the pair were then ordered to face a retrial of the civil case. Mr Murphy a Dundalk-based publican and contractor, and former employee Seamus Daly, from Cullaville, County Monaghan, denied playing central roles in the atrocity.	Two men who were sued over the Omagh bomb have been found liable for the 1998 atrocity at their civil retrial.
The League One side have been under the embargo since November because of a £300,000 bill with HM Revenue & Customs and fees owed to other clubs. The Latics are bottom of the table, three points from safety, and are the lowest scorers in the Football League. "As far as I'm led to believe it should be cleared at the latest next week," Robinson told BBC Radio Manchester. "There is money coming in from the league so hopefully we can clear that and we can try and crack on with things." Oldham have not won a league game since 18 October in what is Robinson's first season in charge after arriving last summer. "We've got plans," the 42-year-old added. "We've had plans since November or December time and we've spoken to a lot of players "Obviously it is not an ideal situation as we've not been able to press the button on things. When we get the green light to go and sign people we'll see if they're still available."	Oldham Athletic should be able to exit their transfer embargo within a week, says manager Stephen Robinson.
The data, published in the Lancet, shows that only one in 200 women - or 0.5% - is still doing any degree of breastfeeding after a year. That compares with 23% in Germany, 56% in Brazil and 99% in Senegal. The researchers said it was a "widespread misconception" that breastfeeding was beneficial only in poor countries. In the UK, 81% of mothers had tried breastfeeding at some point, but only 34% were breastfeeding at six months and 0.5% at 12 months. In the US, 79% started, 49% were still going after six months and 27% after a year. It is the worst record in the world. Breastfeeding is far more common in developing countries, but the UK figures are behind even similar countries in Europe. Women in the UK are advised to feed their baby exclusively on breast milk for the first six months and then a combination of breast milk and other foods, however, it does not give a recommend end-point. Breastfeeding is good for the health of the baby and lowers the risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Prof Cesar Victora, report author from the Federal University of Pelotas in Brazil, said: "There is a widespread misconception that the benefits of breastfeeding only relate to poor countries. "Nothing could be further from the truth, our work clearly shows that breastfeeding saves lives and money in all countries, rich and poor alike." The Lancet report said breastfeeding in developed countries reduced the risk of sudden infant deaths by more than a third. And in poorer countries, half of cases of diarrhoea and a third of respiratory infections could be avoided by breastfeeding. Overall, the report's authors said that near-universal breastfeeding could save over 800,000 children's lives a year. A commentary, signed by Save the Children UK and the World Health Organization, was critical of formula milk being promoted at the expense of breastfeeding. It said: "The active and aggressive promotion of breast milk substitutes by their manufacturers and distributors continues to be a substantial global barrier to breastfeeding. "Promotion and marketing have turned infant formula, which should be seen as a specialised food that is vitally important for those babies who cannot be breastfed, into a normal food for any infant." Commenting on the findings, Sarah Redshaw, from the BabyCentre website, said: "It is crucial to bear in mind the various barriers and challenges faced by mums when it comes to breastfeeding. "Generally mums are aware that breastfeeding is best for their baby but often don't get the right support if they encounter problems in the early weeks - which many, many do. "As a result, significant numbers give up on breastfeeding." Follow James on Twitter.	Rates of breastfeeding in the UK are the lowest in the world, an international study shows.
From September, it will offer the language to students also reading international business and politics. While shorter courses are available at other universities, this is the first time Urdu has been included in the title of an official degree. About 100 million people speak it in the world, including 400,000 in the UK. Yasmin Hussain from the Routes Into Languages university consortium campaigned for the introduction of the new degree. She said: "The discourse is that modern foreign languages like French and Spanish are more important. Minority languages aren't seen to be as valued and so it has taken a long time." Students on the full-time courses will have the chance to learn how the language has been used in film and literature, as well as using Urdu to discuss topics related to their core subject. The launch of the course saw students from local schools take part in workshops and activities, as well as performances by poets and musicians. Writer Sabeena Khan was among those at an open day to launch and promote the Urdu courses. She believes young British Pakistanis in particular would benefit from having Urdu as part of their degree. Ms Khan said: "The language is rich in meaning, its style and usage. It's beautiful and I don't want to see it die out, I want to see more people learning Urdu." Urdu facts... ... And it has also contributed a few words to English Sheraz Ali is one of the lecturers who will be teaching the new undergraduate degree course. "There is a demand for Urdu-related jobs not just in this country but also in many others, especially within professions such as teaching and the health and legal sectors," he said. Mr Ali believed the course would attract students from different backgrounds and not just native speakers of the language. He added: "The Urdu degree is open to everyone, not just people from the South Asian diaspora. We live in a multicultural society, where language isn't only a pile of words but something which can bring people together." You can hear more on this story on BBC Asian Network at 17:00 GMT on Friday, or after that on the BBC iPlayer.	Manchester Metropolitan University has become the first higher education institute in the UK to offer students the chance to earn a degree in Urdu.
A 12-week consultation on the scheme, worth up to £1,200 a child, has begun. Families with two working parents could be able to claim, and ministers said carers who look after disabled relatives and others would be included. Chancellor George Osborne said stay-at-home mothers, who had made a "lifestyle choice", would not be eligible. The government says the overall scheme - set to replace the existing system of employer-supported childcare vouchers - will help 2.5 million families. It is aimed at getting more people back into jobs. The UK has some of the highest childcare costs in the world, with many people with two or more children saying it does not make financial sense for both parents to work. The new system is expected be phased in from autumn 2015, with children under five helped in the first year. It will then build up over time to include all children under the age of 12. Families with two working parents on less than £150,000 each would be able to claim up to £1,200 a year per child. Critics have said the focus on work will penalise parents who stay at home to look after their children, or are unable to work because they act as full-time "carers" for other adults. However, extra details released by the government on Monday make it clear that parents who do not work because they are carers will also be eligible. Carers are defined as those spending at least 35 hours a week looking after someone such as a disabled relative. But the scheme will not be extended to those who stay at home to bring up their children. Lisa Frederiksen, from Epsom, Surrey, was "staggered" by childcare costs for her children Casper, four, and Elizabeth, two. She said: "As a career-orientated woman, when I had my first child at the age of 40 I was staggered at the cost of childcare. "My employer would not agree to a part-time role, so I was faced with childcare costs of £1,200 per month. "After my second child, it became  apparent that working was not going to pay. With two lots of childcare and the costs of commuting, it just wasn't worth working. "My Danish husband's family cannot comprehend the cost of childcare here. They pay £300 a month for care in well-equipped, carefully staffed nurseries. "This new scheme is a drop in the ocean, but we need a radical rethink." Mr Osborne told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: "This is help for formal childcare. Obviously it's not for stay-at-home mothers. "I have huge regard for mothers who want to stay at home and look after their children. That's their lifestyle choice. I want to help those families too. I'm not trying to be exclusive. "We have a proposal on married couples' tax breaks which I'm going to introduce in the Autumn Statement later this year... that will help stay-at-home mothers." Lynne Burnham, secretary of Mothers at Home Matter, called for a "level playing field" for all families, with the introduction of a "family allowance" for all households with children under the age of 16. She added: "It should not be for this government to dictate how a family chooses to care for its children." Under the proposal, parents will be required to open an online voucher account with a voucher provider and have their payments topped up by the government. For every 80p families pay in, the government will put in 20p, up to the annual limit of £1,200. The vouchers will be valid for any Ofsted-regulated childcare in England and equivalent bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Half of the funding for the new scheme will come from the abolition of the previous system of employer-supported childcare vouchers  - which is provided by only about 5% of employers - and in part by funding switched from elsewhere in Whitehall. A separate scheme will provide funding for parents who claim universal credit. It will see the state cover up to 85% of their childcare costs, up from 70% at present. For Labour, shadow children's minister Sharon Hodgson said: "Only David Cameron's government could be so out of touch that they expect families to be grateful for help with childcare in 2015 when they've already seen costs spiralling and support taken away."	The government says it wants to expand a planned childcare tax credit scheme to include parents who stay at home because they are full-time carers.
Jung, 33, had already won at Burghley and Kentucky and completed the treble with a flawless showjumping performance in Sunday's final event. Fellow German Andreas Ostholt finished second on So Is Et, with Britain's Gemma Tattersall third on Arctic Soul. Jung is the second winner of the Grand Slam, emulating Pippa Funnell in 2003. "I think we need a bit of time to realise this very special moment. It's a very big situation," he said. Zara Tindall achieved the Olympic qualification mark on her way to a 23rd-place finish aboard High Kingdom, the horse that took the Queen's granddaughter to team silver at London 2012. Team GB places will not be announced until July but Tattersall has hit the qualifying standard, alongside Tindall, Kristina Cook (seventh on Star Witness), Izzy Taylor  (eighth on Allercombe Ellie) and Ben Way, who came 12th on Galley Light. Jung led after each discipline - dressage, cross country and showjumping - and finished with 34.4 penalty points, a record low at Badminton Park. Ostholt was on 43.4 and Tattersall had 44.6. Tattersall - who had previously finished no higher than 16th at Badminton - made a firm case for Olympic selection. She flawlessly cleared all 13 obstacles in the showjumping finale, as did Ostholt and Jung, ensuring the places stayed the same as at the end of Saturday's cross country. Such was Jung's lead, he could afford to knock down two poles on his final run but sailed through unblemished to earn a standing ovation from a sell-out crowd. Jung will now be a firm favourite to retain his Olympic individual eventing crown and possibly lead his nation to a team title in Rio. Media playback is not supported on this device He spoke of La Biosthetique's trust and called the horse "the best in the world" on Saturday - perhaps unsurprising considering the pair became the first horse-rider combination to hold Olympic, world and European titles in 2012. Ominously for Great Britain - who finished second in team eventing at London 2012 - Jung looks to be in relentless mood as he broke a Badminton points record set in 2006. He also became the first rider to lead from dressage through to conclusion since 2007 but it is the fact he is just the second rider to win a Grand Slam which will make Badminton 2016 live long in the memory of eventing fans. In all, 46 of the 77 horse-rider combinations which started the week made it to the conclusion. A strong New Zealand contingent saw Sir Mark Todd place fourth, raising hope he could compete at a seventh Olympic Games at the age of 60. Todd won individual gold in 1984 and 1988 with a team bronze in Seoul and further bronzes in 2000 (individual) and 2012 (team).	Michael Jung sealed a £240,000 Rolex Grand Slam on La Biosthetique as he became the first German to win a Badminton Horse Trials title.
Accountant in Bankruptcy (AiB) reported 2,405 insolvencies between April and June - 7.8% up on the previous quarter. There were 1,144 bankruptcies, which was up 14.7% on the previous quarter and 51.1% more than a year ago. However, AiB said the figures showed a "return to trend". A year ago, the number of personal insolvencies in Scotland fell to its lowest level for more than 14 years following the introduction of the Bankruptcy and Debt Advice (Scotland) Act. The legislation introduced new measures such as mandatory money advice for people seeking access to statutory debt relief solutions such as sequestration. Although the latest bankruptcy figures were sharply up on a year ago, they were 41.7% lower than the same quarter in 2013-14 and 34.9% lower than in 2014-15. Personal insolvencies include both bankruptcies and protected trust deeds (PTDs). The number of PTDs recorded between April and June remained largely stable at 1,261, a 2.1% increase from the previous quarter. New debt payment programmes approved under the Debt Arrangement Scheme (DAS) fell slightly by 5.2% on the previous quarter, to 510. Quarterly figures for bankruptcies and PTDs since 2005-06: Business Minister Paul Wheelhouse said: "These figures indicate that people are becoming more accustomed to the new insolvency legislation and processes. "We are now seeing the numbers settling down to a more regular pattern following the significant, and expected, drop after the introduction of the new laws. "Compared to the same quarter from two years ago, prior to these changes, the number of people falling into insolvency today is down by more than a third. "This shows those most in need can access the debt relief they require to help them on the road to a fresh financial start - but also that the long term movement is a downward one." Eileen Blackburn, from insolvency trade body R3, said: "This quarterly rise, driven mostly by an increase in bankruptcies, bucks the wider downward trend in Scottish personal insolvencies we've seen in past years. "The number of insolvencies have been falling steadily since their peak in 2012, and this quarter represents a return to more stable levels. "The rise is probably less do with the EU referendum result, which only happened towards the very end of the quarter, and more to do with ongoing difficulties in the Scottish economy and the end of the financial year in March."	Personal insolvency numbers have returned to "relative stability" in Scotland following the introduction last year of new bankruptcy legislation, according to officials.
The victims all worked at the plant 100km (62 miles) east of Porto. The factory's owner was among the dead and several members of his family were either dead or missing, said local mayor Francisco Lopes. Some of the victims were found outside the factory, apparently propelled from the building by the force of the blast. An initial explosion happened shortly after 17:30 (16:30 GMT) on Tuesday, followed by two more blasts, reports said. Five bodies were found late on Tuesday and emergency workers found a sixth victim some 200m (650ft) from the site, minister Jorge Gomes told Portuguese media. The search was being extended to a radius of 800m, he added, because of the scale of the explosion. The factory was described as a family business. As investigators tried to identify the victims, the mayor said that almost all of the eight caught up in the blast were members of Egas Sequeira's family. Mr Sequeira was among those feared dead along with one of his daughters and a son-in-law, Portuguese media said. The owner's wife had left the building just before the explosion and survived but two other family members were among the missing. Officials were initially unable to enter the site because of the potential risk to their safety. Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa was due to visit the scene on Wednesday.	Six people died and another two were missing after an explosion on Tuesday evening destroyed a fireworks factory near the Portuguese town of Lamego.
West Indies, who were 11-3 in pursuit of England's 155-9, needed 19 off the final over to win and did it in style. Marlon Samuels' 85 not out kept them in contention before Brathwaite's match-winning blitz off Ben Stokes. Joe Root scored 54 for England but nothing could stop the Windies joining their women as World T20 champions. In the process, the West Indies also became the first two-time winners of the men's World Twenty20. Despite the devastating loss, England can take a lot of encouragement from their performance in this tournament, which has showcased an attacking philosophy and resilience that was completely lacking during their group-stage exit of last year's 50-over World Cup. But for Brathwaite and Samuels, it would have been Eoin Morgan's side capping their rapid improvement with their own World T20 title. Brathwaite came in at number eight, joining Samuels at the crease in the 16th over with the West Indies on 107-6 and needing 49 from 27 balls. The tall bowler had only batted twice in the competition prior to the final, scoring 10 not out against South Africa and 13 against Afghanistan in the group stages. But, with 19 needed off Stokes' last over, he seized his moment with the bat in spectacular fashion. Brathwaite will take the headlines, but man of the match Samuels was the real architect behind the West Indies' victory courtesy of his 66-ball unbeaten 85 - the highest individual score in a World T20 final, beating his own record of 78, scored in 2012. He was brought to the crease in just the second over following the dismissal of Johnson Charles, who, along with fellow opener Chris Gayle, was one of two wickets claimed by surprise opening bowler Root. Lendl Simmons, who scored a match-winning 82 in the semi-final against India in his first appearance in the competition, was trapped lbw by David Willey in the next over to leave the West Indies reeling. Samuels was given a reprieve in the first over after the powerplay as replays of his edge from Plunkett showed it fell just short of Jos Buttler's gloves, leading to the umpire calling him back to the crease after initially raising his finger. But Samuels kept a cool head after this, scoring at around a run a ball to reach 50 and help his side to 86-3 before accelerating with two sixes and a four in a key 15th over from Plunkett. Two wickets in the 16th over by Willey in the following over swung the game back England's way, but Samuels remained to watch on from the non-striker's end as Brathwaite turned the game decisively in the West Indies' favour. It was a cruel end to the game for Stokes, who had excelled in the field, taking four catches. He left the field in tears. England also got off to a horror start in their innings, with Jason Roy bowled through the gate from just the second ball of Samuel Badree's opening over. Alex Hales (1) and captain Eoin Morgan (5) followed soon after as they faltered to 23-3. This united England's best two batsmen at the crease with plenty of overs to attack and Joe Root and Jos Buttler steadied the ship before taking the game to their opponent to forge the best partnership of the innings - 61 from just under seven overs. However, Buttler fell just as he was looking to accelerate and Root was dismissed with just over five overs remaining as the pressure on his shoulders produced the first false shot of his innings - a mistimed, premeditated attempted scoop that gave a catch to short fine-leg Benn and Brathwaite the second of his three wickets. Only Willey would make another notable contribution, hitting two sixes and a four in a quick-fire 21 to help England to their modest and ultimately insufficient total. England captain Eoin Morgan: "It was filled with ups and downs. We let ourselves down with the bat and probably fell about 40 short. "The decision to open the bowling with Joe Root came about in the last couple of days and golden arm took two wickets in his first over. "Throughout this tournament we have shared a lot of good times but we are all in pain tonight. Ben [Stokes] plays all three formats, it will take him a while to come back but I have no doubts he will have a long career and do well in an England shirt." West Indies captain Darren Sammy: "This win is something we are going to cherish for a long time. We have 15 match-winners but nobody gave us a chance. "We felt disrespected by our board, [commentator] Mark Nicholas described us as having no brains and all this brought us together. The ability to put adversity aside and to play this type of cricket is just tremendous." England head coach Trevor Bayliss: "If you add up the white-ball cricket games these guys have played, it's a long way behind other teams. It's a promising side and the signs are good. "Whatever words I come up with the in the dressing room won't be enough. They're hurting, but it will steel them for the future. "We have still got work to do, but we have a lot of good players to work with. England cricket is in good hands." BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew: "Four successive sixes to win, I have never seen that before. England looked absolutely crushed. It's really good to see a smile on the face of West Indies cricket. It's a unique brand of the game and it needs to be nurtured and encouraged." Former England spinner Vic Marks: "It was a staggeringly good final and a very good tournament. I feel desperately sorry for England who played so tenaciously to get back into the match, and especially for Ben Stokes. On the other hand you have to admire Brathwaite and the way he finished the game." BBC Test Match Special commentator Charles Dagnall: "An incredible tournament with an impossible end... Love T20. But feel for Stokes, like the penalty taker who misses in sudden death."	Carlos Brathwaite hit the first four balls of the final over for six as West Indies stunned England to win the World Twenty20.
Nick Woodman described the remote controlled aircraft as the "ultimate" accessory for his firm's action cameras. He made the announcement at the Code Conference in California, where he also unveiled new kit to that helps capture video footage for virtual reality helmets. One industry watcher said GoPro's move into drones was "very significant". "It's the fact that the company has such a strong brand," explained John Stapley from Amateur Photographer magazine. "It's similar to what you can already see with action cameras. There are a lot of others out there but most people don't know they exist or don't have any interest in them because GoPro has become such a dominant name that it is 'the action brand' as far as they are concerned." The risk for the firm, he added, was that other drone manufacturers would opt to partner with other camera makers to avoid supporting a competitor. The world's bestselling commercial drone maker - China's DJI - has already decided to limit initial sales of its Phantom 3 flagship to a design that features its own proprietary video camera. The previous generation had been launched instead with an optional mount for GoPro cams. Mr Woodman said he planned to release the GoPro drone within the first half of 2016, and that it would be targeted at consumers. "Quadcopters have a special place for us at GoPro because I was a huge radio-controlled plane enthusiast as a kid and I could never really get anyone involved in it with me because it was either too geeky or it took a lot of time to learn how to fly these things - you'd crash them all the time," he said. "So, I was really surprised to see how quickly the general consumer was adopting quadcopters. "Quads plus GoPro has been one of the most democratising combinations in terms of enabling people to capture professional quality content and see themselves in their environment in a way that they'd never seen before. It looks like you're in your own movie." Drones are expected to be one of the fastest growing electronics sectors over the coming years. According to the US's Consumer Electronics Association, the global market for consumer drones totalled $84m (Â£54m) last year but is forecast to top $300m by 2018. The CEA adds that if regulators relax the rules for the use of such aircraft by commercial organisations, the market could further swell to $1bn by 2020. That could represent a lucrative new market for GoPro. The firm's existing cameras and other accessories generated $363m of sales over the first three months of 2015. That was up 54% on the previous year, but resulted in a relatively slim net profit of $16.8m. Mr Woodman also showed off a prototype mount that can hold six of his firm's Hero4 cameras, each pointing in a different direction. He said the resulting footage could be stitched together using software developed by Kolor - a start-up it bought last month - to create a single 6K-quality 360-degree image. This could then be used with virtual reality helmets - allowing a user to change their perspective by turning their head left and right and looking up and down - or via YouTube and Facebook, which are both adding support for interactive spherical videos. The Six-Camera Spherical Array add-on will go on sale later this year. Mr Woodman acknowledged, however, that the high cost of buying enough cameras to fill it was likely to limit the mount's appeal to professionals. At a subsequent event, Google also announced a more elaborate virtual reality capture device, which involves 16 GoPro cameras, as part of a tie-up between the two companies. The footage produced by the Jump camera array will be processed by the search firm's own software to produce panoramas, rather than spherical videos, that make use of depth data deduced by Google's algorithms.	GoPro's chief executive has confirmed it will make its own quadcopter drones.
The 22-year-old Scotland international made five appearances for Leeds in 2012 and was released by the Rhinos at the end of the 2013 Super League season. Hood will join his former Leeds team-mate Ben Jones-Bishop at the Red Devils next season. "I'm very pleased that I've got this chance again and I'm going to take it with both hands," said Hood. He told BBC Radio Manchester: "It's a massive challenge. I've had a couple of years out of top-flight rugby and it's a big change. "You don't realise how much it benefits you being full-time. I'm really looking forward to getting back into it."	Salford Red Devils have signed hooker Liam Hood from Championship One Hunslet Hawks on a two-year deal from 2015.
Christopher Meli, 20, was found dead near houses at Glasvey Close. Detectives said he had suffered a sustained and vicious assault. The youths were detained on Tuesday evening. On Tuesday, three teenagers, two aged 18 and a 16-year-old youth, appeared in court charged with Mr Meli's murder. Two teenagers aged 18 and 17, who were arrested by detectives on Sunday, have been released on bail pending further inquiries.	Five more teenagers - two males and three females - have been arrested over the murder of a man in west Belfast's Twinbrook estate at the weekend.
The 19-year-old striker has appeared three times for Newcastle's first team. "It was my first time away from home. My mum's not there to do everything for me, so I've got to be a big man for myself," he told BBC Radio Northampton. "The football's obviously a bit different tempo-wise but I've managed to adapt to it and I'm enjoying it." He continued: "A little bit (of homesickness), missing my family a lot but other than that it's alright." Toney came through the Cobblers' youth ranks and scored 13 goals in 60 senior games, and is also the youngest player to represent Northampton. He was named the Under-21 Premier League's player of the month for September after two goals in three appearances for Newcastle legend Peter Beardsley's side. He also appeared in the Premier League as a substitute in September's 2-2 draw with Chelsea, and says that he is working on physical strength to compete in the top flight. "If you're not sharp, you're not involved," he said. "I wouldn't try to disrespect the League Two standard, but they are sharper (mentally) and know what they are doing a lot more. "You're trying to get stronger every day, especially at that level you need to be strong and fit, and that's the main thing I'm working on."	Ivan Toney has admitted he struggled with homesickness following his summer move from home-town club Northampton Town to Newcastle United.
Jamie Taggart, from Argyll and Bute, failed to return from a plant-hunting trip to the northern mountainous area. He has not been seen since 2 November, when his rucksack and passport were found at a guest house in Sapa. Mr Taggart, 41, runs Linn Botanic Gardens in the village of Cove on the Rosneath peninsula and serves the area as a retained firefighter. Local police and the British embassy in Hanoi have been informed about his disappearance. Friend and fellow botanist Ian Sinclair, who has been liaising with the search parties, said they had been hampered by horrendous weather. "The snow is continuing to melt, but there is a massive amount of snow damage to the forest such as collapsed trees," he said. "The weather has been horrendous, with snow down to Sapa. This is extremely unusual as Sapa is upper tropical rainforest. "A large group from the national park will be doing an intensive search once the snow melts." A search due to begin on Tuesday will concentrate on four trails inside the forest of Lai Chau and Lao Cai, he said. Family and friends of Mr Taggart in his hometown of Cove have issued an appeal for funds to help cover the cost of the search. A Facebook page - Jamie Taggart Search - has also been set up. Organisations and individuals have so far raised thousands of pounds, including six-year-old Annie Ferguson of Cove who donated her Â£14.50 savings. The botanist's father, Jim Taggart, found out his son was missing when he failed to appear on a scheduled flight home to Scotland on 29 November. He had arrived at a guest house in Sapa on 30 October and left on a motorbike taxi to explore the hills. On 2 November his rucksack and passport were found at the accommodation. Dr Taggart previously told BBC Radio Scotland that he had received a handful of text messages from his son before contact stopped. "I don't think he had got lost. Either something happened to him on his first day on the hills or there is some explanation we can only guess at," he said. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: "We are still in close contact with the local authorities and are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time."	The search for a Scots botanist missing in Vietnam is expected to resume later after being abandoned in heavy snow.
Gordon, 53, is also the National League club's major shareholder and chief executive, and has been in charge of the first team since Dave Hockaday left the role in January. "I think what he's done with the players he's had has been amazing," Brown told BBC Hereford and Worcester. "We haven't always had results, but the football's been the best I've seen." Harriers have struggled all season in the aftermath of major financial problems and look certain to be relegated as they are 12 points adrift of safety at the bottom of the National League table with only nine games to play. Gordon, who has stated that he does not want the head coach's job full-time, previously had a four-game spell in charge following Gary Whild's departure in September. "Colin has a lot of interests in the football club and has a lot of skills," Brown continued. "He is not sure whether his skill-sets are right to be head coach, but I think he should be part of it. "I can see his vision and the brand of football he wants to play and if I don't get him to do it, then second best thing would be that he's part of a team managing the club." Media playback is not supported on this device Brown admitted Harriers were effectively 'bust' last November before Gordon bought a majority stake in the club,  but over the last 12 months have filled a financial "black hole" of £300,000 and reduced the playing budget from a peak of £800,000 two seasons ago to £260,000 at the start of this term. With the club now on the way to becoming self-sufficient, he is adamant they will remain a full-time outfit. "We will break even this year - the first time in 15 years and that's very gratifying," Brown added. "Full-time football can be sustainable and I've got no doubt the future is bright."	Kidderminster chairman Rod Brown says he wants interim head coach Colin Gordon to take the job permanently.
Prosecutors said Darren Byrne, 40, struck Maria Byrne, 35, on the head at their home in Theydon Bois after she discovered he was having an affair. The jury was told Mr Byrne doused his unconscious wife in white spirit and turned on the hob before going out. At Chelmsford Crown Court, Mr Byrne denies murder and arson in February. Prosecutor Andrew Jackson said former city trader Mr Byrne and his wife had a row on the morning of 13 February after she found he was continuing an affair with a married woman. Mr Jackson said: "It's the prosecution case that the catalyst for this alleged murder was Maria Byrne's discovery for the second time of his alleged infidelity." The court was told that after dousing his wife's body with the flammable liquid he went on a walk with the family dog.  CCTV footage showed he was away for more than an hour. Returning to find his plan had not worked, he concocted a charade, said the prosecutor. He called the emergency services to say his wife was "burned" and told the operator: "The stove was on and the frying pan's on the other side of the room. She's not breathing." Mr Byrne told paramedics his wife had been making him a bacon sandwich and when he returned home she was dead, the court heard. A post-mortem examination identified white spirit on Mrs Byrne's clothing and a half-empty bottle of white spirit was found in the garage, the jury heard. The couple had two children together who were not at home at the time of their mother's death. The trial continues.	A man killed his wife and then took their dog out for a walk while he hoped their house would burn down with her inside, a court has heard.
Screen grabs showing the website with messages from gay activists are being circulated on social media sites. In one, the prime minister apologises to all homosexuals living in Uganda and gives his support to a gay pride march. Homosexual acts are illegal in Uganda and gay people have faced physical attacks and social rejection. Earlier this year, a controversial anti-gay bill, which proposes to increase the penalties for homosexual acts from 14 years in jail to life, was re-tabled in the Ugandan parliament. The bill was first introduced in 2009 but never debated - and the MP backing the legislation says a clause proposing the death penalty will be dropped. It originally said those found guilty of "aggravated homosexuality" - defined as when one of the participants is a minor, HIV-positive, disabled or a "serial offender" - would face the death penalty. The Uganda Justice Law and Order Sector website was also reportedly taken over by hackers this week. Ambrose Ruyooka, commissioner for the Information Communications Technology ministry, told the BBC the problem had now been rectified. The government has created a directorate of security for all government websites and tightened cyber laws to counter rising cyber crime, he said. An activist named @DramaSett3r on Twitter is said to be behind the attacks. The operations were carried out by a group known as The Elite Society and the Anonymous hacktivist community, the activist said. On Wednesday, the official website of Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi quoted him as saying: "We have got to expel the narrow mindedness from this country, and begin afresh, starting with a full and formal apology to all homosexuals living in Uganda today," screen grabs on Twitter and Facebook show. A message allegedly posted by the hackers on the prime minister's site on Tuesday said: "Your violations of the rights of LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] people have disgusted us. "All people have the right to live in dignity free from the repression of someone else's political and religious beliefs." The East African nation is a largely conservative society and many people condemn homosexuality both as unAfrican and unChristian. Western donors have recently said they could withdraw aid from those countries, including many in Africa, which do not recognise gay rights.	The Ugandan prime minister's website was attacked by hackers on Tuesday and Wednesday, a government official has confirmed to the BBC.
The 33-year-old Portugal international has agreed a one-year contract. The ex-Genoa and Braga man "will provide experienced cover and competition for Thibaut Courtois and Asmir Begovic", Chelsea said. "All the colleagues I have always say the dream is to come to the Premier League, where there are the best clubs and the best players," Eduardo added.

Its annual report singles out President Donald Trump as an example of an "angrier and more divisive politics". But it criticises other leaders, including those of Turkey, Hungary and the Philippines, who it says have used narratives of fear, blame and division. The group also says governments are exploiting refugees for political ends. The report, which covers 159 countries, cited a rise in hate speech across the US and Europe targeting refugees and said the reverberations would see more attacks on people on the basis of race, gender, nationality and religion. It criticised countries that, it said, once claimed to champion rights abroad and that were now rolling back human rights at home. "Instead of fighting for people's rights, too many leaders have adopted a dehumanizing agenda for political expediency," Salil Shetty, secretary general of Amnesty International, said in a statement. "The limits of what is acceptable have shifted. Politicians are shamelessly and actively legitimizing all sorts of hateful rhetoric and policies based on people's identity: misogyny, racism and homophobia." The group made special reference to Mr Trump's executive order last month that banned refugees and immigrants from seven mostly Muslim countries from entering the US. It said Mr Trump put "his hateful xenophobic pre-election rhetoric" into action by signing the measure. The US president, who recently said he was the "least racist" and "least anti-Semitic person", is expected to unveil an updated order this week. But Amnesty also mentioned Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban as leaders who were using the "us versus them" rhetoric. "2016 was the year when the cynical use of 'us vs them' narratives of blame, hate and fear took on a global prominence to a level not seen since the 1930s," Mr Shetty added, citing the year when Adolf Hitler rose to power in Germany. "A new world order where human rights are portrayed as a barrier to national interests makes the ability to tackle mass atrocities dangerously low, leaving the door open to abuses reminiscent of the darkest times of human history." Kate Allen, director of Amnesty UK, criticised as "shameful" the recent decision by the British government to halt the scheme which allowed the entry of unaccompanied refugee children already in Europe, estimated to be 90,000. The group also cited in its report: The London-based group exceptionally launched its report in Paris, saying that France has seen an erosion of its rights in the name of security. The French government says its measures, which followed a series of attacks in 2015, are necessary to protect the country.	Politicians who have used a divisive and dehumanised rhetoric are creating a more divided and dangerous world, says rights group Amnesty International.
28 June 2016 Last updated at 08:03 BST On 1 July 1916, British soldiers started fighting in the Battle of the Somme. The people in charge said that the battle had to happen to win the war. But by the time it was over, more than a million soldiers on both sides had died or were injured. Even now people can't agree on whether it was the right decision or a huge mistake. Martin has been to the trenches in northern France to find out what happened.	This Friday marks the 100th anniversary of one of the deadliest battles in World War One.
The incident happened on the Whiterock Road at about 15:00 GMT on Friday afternoon. Police said it was witnessed by people waiting to pick up prescriptions, including children. The man has been charged with two counts of criminal damage, disorderly behaviour and of assault on police. He is due to appear at Belfast Magistrates Court on 5 December.	A 34-year-old man has been charged after windows were smashed and a doctor was verbally abused at a west Belfast health centre.
They know him of old, of course, but for many this is a potentially new David Cameron, freshly elected with an unexpected majority. Many leaders got rather irritated with the prime minister in the long lead up to the election. They felt he played too much to the Eurosceptic gallery at home when abroad on EU business. Will this new David Cameron be a man they can work with, they wonder? They'd like to. With the UK's in/out referendum EU on membership looming large in European headlines, most want to ensure Britain stays in, especially in Germany, as I found out earlier this week on a trip to Berlin. The UK's former ambassador to Germany, Sir Peter Torry, describes the country as the best friend and ally the UK could have in its EU renegotiation. Pretty useful for Mr Cameron, as Germany is Europe's most powerful nation. There are very practical reasons why Germans are so keen to keep Britain in - and not just because they share a love for sausages and beer, as one student I chatted to suggested. German businesses appreciate Britain's free trade, single market, and anti red-tape push. They see this as a counterweight to the EU's more protectionist, interventionist countries. German taxpayers agree with the UK's drive to crack down on welfare claims by migrants. And Germany is very keen to avoid having to pay even more into the EU budget. It would end up making up most of the shortfall if the UK walked away. So there's lots of good will, but no blank cheque. I asked German MP Michael Fuchs, of Angela Merkel's CDU party, how far the Chancellor would go to help Britain. She'll offer "utmost flexibility", I was told, but there would also be red lines. There is little appetite in Germany or anywhere outside Britain for fundamental changes to existing EU treaties (for example to curb the freedom of EU citizens to live and work where they like in the EU). Though the suggestion has been made in several countries that when treaties are eventually changed to facilitate more harmony in the eurozone, that's when the UK could possibly have its own treaty-changing elements written in. But the timing looks wrong for Britain. German Finance Minister Wolgang Schaeuble says any treaty change is unlikely before the UK holds its EU referendum. But there is a widespread hunger for EU change - from the north amongst the Scandinavian countries to Europe's southern reaches. Governments realise that, with near deflation and high youth unemployment, especially in Spain, France and Italy, the EU is failing to live up to the aspirations of its almost half a billion citizens. The question for Britain's prime minister is whether the change favoured by his European partners match the changes David Cameron wants? Not all his European counterparts are prepared to be as open as Angela Merkel when it comes to UK requests. Not everyone would be as regretful as Germany if the UK were to leave. David Cameron has announced he will begin bilateral visits with his European colleagues as soon as this summit is over. They expect concrete details on what exactly Britain wants from the EU by the leaders' next summit at the end of June.	EU leaders are curious to meet the British prime minister when he joins the Eastern Partnership Summit in Riga.
Patrick McGinley, 46, and his son William McGinley, 27, of Lisfarrell, Edgeworthstown, County Longford are accused of murdering Bernard McGinley. He was shot dead outside a wedding in Newtownbutler in February. The two men are to be released on conditions including a Â£50,000 cash surety and daily reports to police. The court was told the weapon used in the shooting in February 2015 has not been recovered	The Public Prosecution Service has lost an appeal against the granting of bail for two men charged with murdering a relative at a wedding in Fermanagh.
Margaret Jamieson, 70, from Peebles, suffered fatal injuries in the accident at about 16:40 on Monday on the A703, north of Redscarhead. Two other people - a man and a woman - were seriously injured and were taken to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Police have urged anyone who witnessed the crash, involving a Nissan Quashqai and a VW Caddy, to contact them.	Police have named a woman killed in a crash between a car and van near Peebles in the Borders.
The John Deere tractor was pulled over by officers in the village of Ripley and had two other males on board. The vehicle had been seen in nearby Harrogate at about 05:00 GMT with no headlights on. Police said the driver had no licence, was not insured and did not have permission from the tractor's owner. The vehicle was seized, with the three due to be interviewed by officers. Posting on Twitter, Insp Chris Galley said: "A strange end to a night shift. 15-year-old lad driving a tractor as a taxi for his drunk mates."	A tractor being driven by a 15-year-old boy "as a taxi for his drunk mates" has been stopped by police in North Yorkshire.
Chris Dent's 100 off 111 balls was the backbone of Gloucestershire's total of 260 all out. In reply, an 87-run fourth-wicket stand between Johann Myburgh (81) and James Hildreth (48) had the hosts on course until six wickets went down for 32. But Jamie Overton put on 65 for the last wicket with Tim Groenewald as Somerset claimed victory on 263-9. Overton made 40 and Groenewald hit 34 in an unbroken stand of 65 off 49 balls, the second highest 10th-wicket stand to win a one-day match in England. After the trophy holders were put into bat by their neighbours, Dent played exceptionally well whilst his teammates fell around him, reaching three figures off 107 balls before being caught at cover off Groenewald. Spinner Roelof van der Merwe starred for the home side, running out Iain Cockbain as well as dismissing Benny Howell, Tom Smith and bowled Craig Miles off the final ball of Gloucestershire's innings. The visitors reduced their local rivals to 15-2 as Adam Hose and Peter Trego fell cheaply. But they rallied well until Myburgh picked out long-off off Dent to fall for 81 and begin a middle-order implosion. Lewis Gregory was then superbly run out and Hildreth was caught and bowled by Smith in the next over as Somerset fell from 166-3 to 198-9. But, with 63 still needed to win, Overton and Groenewald refused to go down without a fight in this local derby, finding the boundary with ease. They survived one near miss when, with the hosts still needing 13 off 3.1 overs, wicketkeeper Gareth Roderick missed a golden opportunity to run out last man Groenewald.	Somerset beat One-Day Cup holders Gloucestershire by one wicket with just three balls to spare at Taunton.
Portugal international centre-back Alves became Caixinha's first signing as Rangers boss last week. And McCarthy, who was at Porto when Alves was breaking through, insists he will prove a shrewd capture. "He'll bring something different to Rangers and beef up their defence, so he's the right defender to bring in," McCarthy told BBC Scotland. "Bruno has a wealth of experience, he's played at the highest level and he's a winner. "He'll give them a bit more stability at the back, more bite, he's a leader and he'll organise that defence. His communication won't be a problem because his English is very good. "Bruno is very composed and calm on the ball so he will help the way the manager wants to play things from the back. Bruno is the perfect fit for what the manager is trying to bring to Rangers right now." As impressed as McCarthy is by the signing of Alves, he reckons Rangers will have to bring in a few more players of a similar calibre before they will be in a position to seriously challenge Celtic. Brendan Rodgers' side finished 39 points ahead of the Ibrox outfit as they won the Premiership and went on to secure an unbeaten domestic treble. "I'm not too sure he'll be able to change that because Celtic are so strong," McCarthy said. "It's going to take more than one Bruno Alves in that Rangers side to take the title from Celtic, but if they sign a couple more players like Bruno, then I think Rangers are in with a shout of giving Celtic a run for their money." Alves began his career at Porto and had various loan spells before becoming a first-team regular, winning nine major honour with the Dragons. He joined Zenit Saint Petersburg for £18m in 2010, with whom he won two league titles and the Russian Super Cup before joining Turkish giants Fenerbahce for £4.5m in 2013. There he won one league title and the Turkish Super Cup and then in 2016 he moved to Italian Serie A side Cagliari, from whom he joined Rangers. Part of the Portugal squad that won the European Championships in 2016, Alves has 89 caps for his national side, and McCarthy is convinced the defender has a lot more football left in him, despite being 35 years old. "He's a fitness fanatic and looks after himself exceptionally well so that will keep him going for a few years," he added. "The experience that he'll bring, Rangers really need it from what I've seen last season." And the South African has assured Rangers fans that while Alves is the type of robust defender they need, he will not be a regular in the notebooks of Scotland's referees. "Everybody has a bit of temper in him but Bruno will choose his moments wisely, he's a senior player in that squad and he has to be an example," McCarthy added. "He can't do silly things that leave the team hanging because they will depend on his experience and to guide the young players. I don't think he'll end up in hot water too many times but he'll bring some fight to that Rangers defence."	Benni McCarthy says his former Porto team-mate Bruno Alves is the perfect fit for Pedro Caixinha's Rangers.
In July, Conor McGinn, who is from south Armagh, claimed the Labour leader suggested phoning his father. It followed an interview in which he called for Mr Corbyn to "reach out beyond his comfort zone". A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said at the time that it was "untrue". The St Helens MP told BBC Radio Four's Westminster Hour: "The modus operandi that he (Mr Corbyn) and the people around him were trying to do, involving my family, was to isolate and ostracise me from them and from the community I am very proud to come from -  which is an Irish, nationalist community in south Armagh." The MP claimed that after he spoke out about Mr Corbyn in May, he got a call from the Labour whips' office saying the party leader had initially asked for his resignation and then considered sacking him. But subsequently, through his spokesman, he had asked for an apology and retraction, which Mr McGinn refused to make. The MP said he then texted the Labour leader to make clear no offence was intended and reiterate that their friendship was important to him and asking for a meeting. He received no response, but said he was then informed by the whips' office that Mr Corbyn had proposed asking the MP's father, Pat, to intervene. Pat McGinn was Sinn Féin councillor in Newry for many years, serving as the council's mayor between 2005 and 2006.	A Labour MP who accused Jeremy Corbyn of threatening to use his father - former Sinn Féin mayor Pat McGinn - to "bully me into submission" has spoken publicly about the row.
Japan's shares rose despite a central bank survey showing firms expect inflation to rise 1.4% a year from now, casting doubts on the bank's pledge to hit 2% this fiscal year. The Nikkei 225 ended up 1.5% at 19,312.79, leading the region's gains. That is its biggest daily percentage gain since 12 February. Investors are also awaiting key jobs figures from the US on Friday. Concerns over the health of the world's largest economy were raised after data on Wednesday showed the pace of US manufacturing growth in March eased to its slowest in nearly two years. The dollar remained under pressure, buying 119.62 yen. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed 0.4% higher at 3,825.78, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index ended up 0.8% at 25,275.64. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 closed up 0.7% at 5,898.6 as bank stocks were boosted on growing expectations of an interest rate cut by the central bank next week. A private survey also showed that inflation rose from a five-year trough in March as petrol prices rebounded. The TD Securities-Melbourne Institute's monthly measure of consumer prices rose 0.4% in March, from February when it had been unchanged. The annual pace was up to 1.5%, from 1.3%, but stayed well below the central bank's target band of 2% to 3%. The Australian market will be closed on Friday and Monday for the Easter holiday. South Korean shares closed flat after data showed the country's seasonally-adjusted current account surplus in February at a record high for the second consecutive month. Exports in February rose by 2% from January while imports fell 0.4%. The benchmark Kospi index was at 2,029.07.	Asian shares rose on Thursday despite investors being cautious ahead of a Good Friday public holiday in some major markets.
In a telephone call, US Secretary of State John Kerry told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi the US had "strong concerns" over recent developments. Last week, Chinese and Vietnamese ships clashed over the drilling rig that China has placed in waters near the disputed Paracel Islands. China and Manila are also at odds over overlapping territorial claims. Beijing claims a U-shaped swathe of the South China Sea that covers areas other South East Asian nations say are their territory. The issue has been rumbling in recent years amid an increasingly assertive stance from China over its claims. Last week, several collisions were reported between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels in disputed waters as the Vietnamese ships sought to prevent the installation of the Chinese drilling rig. Reports suggest the stand-off - involving dozens of ships - is continuing, with water cannon fire being exchanged. On Sunday, anti-China protests took place in several Vietnamese cities. It is the most serious confrontation between the two nations for several years. In Monday's telephone call, Mr Kerry "said China's introduction of an oil rig and numerous government vessels in waters disputed with Vietnam was provocative", US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. "He urged both sides to de-escalate tensions, ensure safe conduct by their vessels at sea, and resolve the dispute through peaceful means in accordance with international law." Separately, in comments made at a meeting with the Singaporean foreign minister, Mr Kerry called the Chinese move an "aggressive act". Mr Wang, meanwhile, urged Mr Kerry to be objective on the issue, a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said. Tensions between Beijing and Manila are also running high, after the Philippines arrested and then charged nine Chinese fishermen with poaching at a disputed shoal. The Philippines is in the process of taking China to a UN court over its territorial claims. It has also recently signed a new security deal with the US which would allow an expanded US troop presence, in a move seen as linked to Manila's deteriorating ties with Beijing. On Tuesday, Chinese state media slammed the Philippines, saying that if it continued to challenge China it would pay "an unaffordable price".	The US has warned China that moving a drilling rig into seas disputed with Vietnam was "provocative".
A statement from Greaves's family said the 75-year-old, who had a minor stroke in 2012, had been taken ill on Sunday. Greaves scored 44 goals in 57 England games and a club-record 220 league goals for Tottenham having started his career at Chelsea. "His wife Irene and four children have asked for privacy during what is a worrying time," added the statement. "Jimmy had a minor stroke in 2012, but appeared to have made a full recovery. "He was due to be inducted into the Tottenham Hotspur Hall of Fame on 13 May at a sell-out ceremony at White Hart Lane." Greaves is fourth on the list of all-time England goalscorers, behind Sir Bobby Charlton, Gary Lineker and Wayne Rooney. He was part of England's 1966 World Cup-winning squad but originally missed out on a medal because he was injured during the tournament's group stage. At the time, only the 11 winning players on the pitch at the end of the final received the award, although football's governing body Fifa changed that practice in 2007. The World Cup squad players and the families of team manager Sir Alf Ramsey and other backroom staff were finally presented with medals in 2009. Tottenham posted a message of support on their official Twitter feed shortly after the news of Greaves's stroke emerged. "Everyone at the club wishes Jimmy Greaves a speedy recovery after he suffered a stroke yesterday," the message read. "Our thoughts are with Jimmy and his family at this difficult time." Greaves scored 124 league goals for Chelsea, then a club record, between 1957 and 1961. Chelsea tweeted: "All at Chelsea are thinking of former Blue Jimmy Greaves and his family at this time. We wish him a full and swift recovery." England World Cup winner Sir Geoff Hurst, who scored a hat-trick in the 1966 final, said on Twitter: "Thinking of my friend and one of our greats this morning. Wishing him all the best and hoping for a speedy recovery." Hurst replaced Greaves in the England team in 1966 after he injured a shin against France during the group stages. Greaves helped Tottenham win the FA Cup in 1962 and 1967, while his career also included spells at AC Milan and West Ham United. In the 1980s he forged a new career as a football pundit on ITV, most notably alongside former Liverpool striker Ian St John on 'Saint and Greavsie', which ran from 1985 to 1992. Former Tottenham striker and BBC Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker tweeted: "Choked to read that Jimmy Greaves has had a severe stroke. One of my absolute heroes. Thoughts are with him and his family. Get well, Jimmy."	Former England and Tottenham striker Jimmy Greaves is in intensive care after suffering a severe stroke.
The 28-year-old has scored 37 goals in 98 appearances since joining the Lions from non-league Halifax in 2014. "Lee committing his future to us is a big boost for everybody and a sensible decision from the boy," boss Neil Harris told the club website. "He has played his best football under me and he is a big part of this squad."	Striker Lee Gregory has signed a new contract with League One side Millwall, which will keep him at The Den until the summer of 2018.
About 10 caravans arrived at the King George V playing fields car park in Topsham Road, Exeter on Friday. Nigel Parker, the Central Youth Football Club chairman, said he could not have children walking through their campsite to the changing rooms and had cancelled all games this weekend. He described the situation as "irritating". "They are parked next to the changing rooms. I couldn't take the risk," said Mr Parker. The site has a number of full-sized football pitches, a youth rugby pitch and a children's playground. Labour councillor Marcel Choules said: "It's disastrous that the football matches have had to be cancelled as a result. "People aren't against travellers, what people are against is the disruption caused." A spokesman for Exeter City Council, which owns the site, said they have attended for an initial inspection. The travellers are yet to comment.	Fourteen football matches have been cancelled after travellers set up camp next to playing fields.
Scotland voted No to independence in 2014 following an often frenzied campaign and a record-breaking turnout of 84.6%. But things have changed since then - most notably the decision by the UK to leave the European Union. So have Scottish voters changed their minds? Ruairidh Forbes was so keen to vote No to independence in 2014 that he delayed moving from Edinburgh to London where he was due to begin a PhD in physics. Ruairidh, from North Berwick, says he was not convinced that the financial security of an independent Scotland could be guaranteed. But now he plans to vote Yes. "I am worried about a decline in science and technology funding in the UK after Brexit," Ruairidh explains. "Independence is our best shot at staying in the EU." Ruairidh is now three years into his doctoral studies and sees the benefits brought to the UK by the Â£7.6bn received from the EU for scientific research in 2007-13. "The British government relies on EU funding to prop up UK science and technology - I am worried that the sector will collapse once Brexit happens. "This means that we won't be able to take part in visionary research or cutting-edge projects like the Large Hadron Collider at Cern in Switzerland." "There are no contingency plans being laid at Westminster." Although there is no guarantee that an independent Scotland would become a member of the EU, Ruairidh believes signs suggest that voting for independence is Scotland's best chance to preserve science and technology research. But is he worried that this is also a vote for the SNP, a party that he does not support? "I don't think they are the right party for Scotland - I'm not a nationalist, I see myself as British. "But I believe the independence movement is motivated by social issues and this is a unique opportunity for fairer politics." Hadron Collider: Has it discovered a new particle? "I used to think Scotland had the ability to do well alone," explains Nichola Dadds, who is 50 and lives in Edinburgh. "I voted Yes to independence in 2014 but a lot has changed since then." Nichola wanted to stay in the EU - but now that Britain has decided to leave, she is worried that as a small country Scotland would be marginalised in the European Union. "Much of Scotland's trade is with the UK or non-EU countries like China or the US - if we left the UK, I am not convinced we could get a good trade deal. "I would be concerned about joining the EU as a small country. Look at countries like Ireland and Italy - they have little say in Europe," explains Nichola. "I believe if Scotland became independent from the rest of the UK we would end up beholden to the EU and my thoughts are, 'Better the devil you know,'" Nichola says. Instability caused by the fallout from Brexit is another reason why she changed her mind. "I want to vote for stability and security. We have had enough of referendums - it is time to get used to what is going on instead of causing more disruption." Scotland's trade with UK rises to Â£50bn Keeping Scotland out of the European Union is Steven Calvert's motivation to change his vote from Yes to No. In 2014 Steven, who lives in Inverness, voted for independence as a protest vote against the Conservative government in Westminster. "I voted yes to escape David Cameron and rule by a party that Scotland did not vote for. "But now I plan to vote No - I want Scotland to be out of the EU and independence could jeopardise that." Steven wants to set up a seafood export business and opposes the fishing regulations that come with EU membership: "People here talk about how the EU has made it hard for small fishermen to make a living. "Big trawlers come in from countries like Spain, and we can't find a place to fish. "I think Scotland leaving the EU gives us the chance for a more sustainable quota, hopefully encouraging restoration of the Scottish fishing industry. That would offer good jobs to young people, especially in rural areas." Reality check: the impact of the EU on farming and fishing Jessica Orr felt ashamed in 2014 that she did not vote for independence. "I'm very sensible and pragmatic - I felt that it was too risky, but all my friends and colleagues voted Yes," she explains. Now she has a second chance, she plans to do things differently. "I feel like after Brexit and President Trump's victory, politics has become really degraded and I've realised how positive the independence idea is. "I'm frustrated that we've been forced to leave the EU despite the fact that Scotland did not vote for it. "Without the EU, I feel like we will be worse off, and I am frustrated about the changes to immigration policies in the UK. "Scots are not represented at Westminster and I feel like Scottish political leaders have more integrity than those in Westminster or the US." By Georgina Rannard, UGC & social news	First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced that she is seeking a second referendum on Scottish independence to take place before Britain leaves the European Union.
The bird's head and wings became stuck in the wire fence in Bethesda while it was chasing a wood pigeon. RSPCA Inspector Mike Pugh, who freed the animal, said: "The buzzard was feisty, but luckily, had not had much feather damage. "I released the bird back to the wild where he belongs straight away."	A buzzard has been rescued after becoming trapped between fencing and a wall in Gwynedd.
Three operators have been shortlisted for the Northern Rail franchise and three for First TransPennine Express (TPE), with the winners due to be announced in October 2015. The Campaign for Better Transport and the RMT transport union are concerned rail services could be cut. But, rail minister Claire Perry promised a "world-class rail network". The franchises connect passengers travelling between the key strategic cities of Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield, Manchester, Newcastle and Carlisle and onwards to Edinburgh and Glasgow. The companies competing for the Northern franchise are Arriva, Govia and Abellio, which has held the contract in a joint venture with Serco since 2004. The three shortlisted for TPE are FirstGroup, Keolis and Stagecoach. FirstGroup and Keolis currently operate TPE in a joint venture. The government said franchise bidders would need to improve customer service and passenger satisfaction on the two networks which carry more than 110 million passengers last year. Ms Perry said: "Building a railway that is fit for the 21st century is a vital part of our long-term economic plan, connecting businesses and communities, generating jobs and boosting growth." Over the next five years, more than Â£1bn will be spent on the rail network in the north, the government has said. This includes Â£600m for the Northern Hub project and electrification projects in the north-west and across the Trans-Pennine routes. The RMT held a protest outside Westminster on Monday opposing plans for the Northern and TPE franchises. Mick Cash, RMT acting general secretary, said: "This was just round one of the fight to stop the carve up of jobs and services on Northern and TransPennine Express."	The shortlist of companies bidding to run rail networks in the north of England has been announced.
Emmerson Whittel may need surgery on his jaw, while the club alleges player Josh Lynam was also bitten on the ear. The RFL's match review panel will look at official video on Thursday, as it does for all on-field incidents. Keighley have gathered additional video from spectators following an appeal. Footage already online, shot from the stands, shows a number of fights breaking out on the field between the two sets of players. Following the incident, Whittel posted on Twitter that brackets and bands had been used to try to re-align his jaw and that he faces at least three months out. Keighley Cougars of League One, England's third-tier competition, progressed to the Challenge Cup fourth round with a 50-32 win over Fryston Warriors - a side from the second tier of England's amateur game. The match, a "home" game for Fryston, was played at nearby Featherstone in West Yorkshire after the tie was at risk of being reversed and played at Keighley instead. Keighley have also complained to the RFL about their off-field treatment before kick-off, as they allege players and members of staff were refused entry to the ground without a valid matchday ticket. A statement on Keighley's website said: "The players' allocation of 'family and friends' tickets was then claimed to have been used to admit the playing squad and coaching staff into the ground. "The club is outraged by this development." The BBC contacted Fryston Warriors, who have declined to comment at this time.	Keighley want the Rugby Football League to consider amateur video footage when they review a brawl during the club's Challenge Cup tie against Fryston, which left a player with a broken jaw.
He told The Hollywood Reporter he was "super excited" and wanted "to put a different spin on it", but did not expand on what role he would play. The film will see Jordan reunite with his Creed director Ryan Coogler. "I'm looking forward to working with Ryan once again. It's gonna be a good time," he said. He added he could not wait to work with Nyong'o, who won a best supporting actress Oscar for 12 Years a Slave in 2014, as well as Chadwick Boseman - who is currently on the big screen playing Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War. Jordan played the Human Torch in last year's Fantastic Four flop reboot.  Nyong'o also played CGI character Maz Kanata in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Black Panther will be released in February 2018.	Michael B Jordan has confirmed he and Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o will be among the cast of the upcoming Marvel superhero film Black Panther.
The 35-year-old threw a new F51 European record of 17.68m to score 1100 points and finish ahead of team-mates Josie Pearson and Gemma Prescott. It beat the previous best of 15.83 set by Ireland's Catherine O'Neill in 2001. "I'm throwing well at the moment and once I got the big throw, I knew the pressure was off," said Butterfield. The Glasgow-based newcomer, who was left paralysed by a tumour on her spinal cord in 2011,  took up athletics earlier this year via the talent identification programme Girls4Gold after playing wheelchair rugby for a couple of years. "Because I was already doing rugby and the strength and conditioning work with that, I just had to try to adapt that to athletics," she told BBC Sport. "I've loved it and trained hard but I know I have a lot more to learn. "Representing GB for the first time here has been a bit surreal but the team has been great and everyone has been really welcoming. "The difference sport has made to me is huge but I never dreamed I would be part of this so soon." Compatriot Pearson was frustrated after three of her six throws were deemed to be fouls. "There was a technical issue with my throws with an official saying I was breaking some of the rules," she said. "I've been throwing the same way all season and not been pulled up on it before so it is frustrating for this to happen at a major championship where I know I could have thrown further."	Debutant Jo Butterfield led a British clean sweep of the medals in the women's F32/51 club throw at the IPC Athletics European Championships.
Vale took a deserved lead when AJ Leitch-Smith converted Byron Moore's cross. Jamal Campbell-Ryce equalised just after half-time with a drilled finish and Sam Hird headed the hosts in front. JJ Hooper's curling shot brought the visitors level, but Gboly Ariyibi turned in a corner and O'Shea's 20-yard shot sealed the win. The win moved the Spireites up to 17th, five points clear of the relegation zone, while Port Vale dropped to 13th, 10 points adrift of the play-off places.	Chesterfield boosted their hopes of staying up with a comeback win to dent Port Vale's slender play-off hopes.
The UK stage of the race comes to the city on 7 July. Cycling enthusiast Rad Wagon is recruiting people to knit 3,000 miniature "Tour jerseys" and wool-covered bicycle wheels. Schools and knitting groups have already offered to start knitting and the council was "interested", he said. A similar "mini-jersey" idea is being promoted by Harrogate Borough Council for the Yorkshire stage of the race. The public response to that was so overwhelming the council had to ask people not to send any more knitting to them. "It's a bit copycat but we can do so much more," Mr Wagon said. "The city's well-known for its knitters and 'yarn bombers' who cover everything from bikes to trees to lamp-posts. It's 'very Cambridge'. "I think knitting is in Cambridge's DNA," he added. Mr Wagon, a cycling skills and bicycle maintenance trainer from Outspoken Training in the city, said he was a fan not only of the Tour de France, but the cultural activities surrounding it. "It isn't just a bike race. Its history is all about promoting your town and region and that's something we can do. "The world's eyes will be on us and it's a chance for us to show that Cambridge can do things slightly differently, and perhaps slightly oddly," he said. A knitting shop owner has offered to give knitting lessons and collect the tiny pullovers, Mr Wagon said. A cycle shop in the city has also offered a collection of battered wheels which Mr Wagon hopes can also be turned into knitted decorations. He said he was discussing suitable places his knitted bunting might go, with the city council.	A man who admits he "cannot knit a stitch" is hoping to cover the streets of Cambridge with knitted bunting and wool artwork during the Tour de France.
The winners of this year's aerial photography competition run by online site Dronestagram have been announced.

When Adidas, Gazprom, Hyundai-Kia, McDonald's, Budweiser, Coca-Cola and Visa signed their deals, they would have envisaged seeing their brands beamed into millions of households around the world. Pitch-side exposure at World Cup matches, accompanied by high-profile advertising campaigns, means that backing the World Cup guarantees getting your company promoted in all parts of the globe. However, having spent tens of millions of pounds to be associated with sporting excellence, those famous brands now find their name and products associated with the increasingly tarnished Fifa brand, arrests and allegations of "rampant, systemic, and deep-rooted corruption". A number of the sponsors - Coca-Cola, Kia, Adidas and Visa - have made known their concerns about what is happening at Fifa, with the latter particularly vociferous, warning that unless the global governing body makes "changes now", it would "reassess our sponsorship". And McDonald's said it "takes matters of ethics and corruption very seriously and the news from the US Department of Justice is extremely concerning. We are in contact with FIFA on this matter. We will continue to monitor the situation very closely". For the four years of the last "World Cup cycle", from 2011 to 2014, Fifa's six top tier Global Partners (as was - it is now five) paid a total of $177m (Â£116m) annually, which would mean each partner paid roughly $30m a year for this status. Tier one sponsor Sony decided not to renew its contract last year - it had been a Fifa partner since 2007, after signing a contract in 2005 worth $38m annually. One publicity-savvy bookmaker has offered odds on which sponsor will be the first to pull out of its association with football's Swiss-based powerbrokers. It has Visa as the favourites, followed by Hyundai-Kia, although none of Fifa's backers have said yet they are ending their deals. Russian gas firm Gazprom is bottom of the betting to leave, and indeed it has put out a statement saying the current situation will have "no influence" on its agreement. But as the scandal is not likely to go away any time soon, what damage is being done to these well-known companies, some of whom have associations with Fifa stretching back decades? "This is disastrous for the main core group of big Fifa sponsors. For them, this is a major issue," says Anastasia Kourovskaia, a brands expert at agency Millward Brown. "The idea of sponsorship is to transfer the goodwill that supporters feel for the sport, to the benefit of a brand's equity." She suggests that the big seven corporations may have to position themselves at arms-length from Fifa, if they do not want to be hit by the fall-out from the sensational developments. "The solution is to emphasise that they are supporting football for the benefit of the game itself, and the pleasure and challenge of winning and playing football, rather than Fifa as an organisation," she says. "They have to differentiate themselves from Fifa's management." In addition, she points out that as this is not the first scandal to hit Fifa, it might be a good time for the sponsors to form a committee of their own "to ensure the ethical running of big global football events". One other unforeseen outcome of the furore may be that in future, potential sports sponsors may look to back smaller, grass-roots, events - which traditionally have been more complex and costly to back - rather than global blockbusters such as World Cups, which have a greater potential for scandal. "This might be the tipping point that sees sponsors move away from events which are 'uniform' across the world, and towards more local events," she says. Adidas - the German sportswear firm has been supplying the official match ball for all Fifa World Cup tournament matches since 1970. Also involved in all other Fifa events, such as the Confederations Cup Brazil 2013, and the Fifa U-20 World Cups for women and men. Coca-Cola - the US soft drinks firm is one of the longest-standing corporate partners of Fifa, with a formal association since 1974 and an official sponsorship of the Fifa World Cup that began in 1978. Coca-Cola has had stadium advertising at every Fifa World Cup since 1950. Gazprom - the Russian energy giant signed up with Fifa in 2013 as a partner for all competitions in the period of 2015 to 2018, including the 2018 Fifa World Cup, which is due to take place in Russia for the first time. (The firm is also an official partner of the Uefa Champions League 2012 to 2015). Hyundai/Kia - the South Korean carmaker began its Fifa alliance in 1999, in a deal to sponsor 13 Fifa competitions including the 2002 World Cup, an agreement extended to the 2006 event. It again backed the 2010  World Cup and is now the official Automotive Partner of Fifa until 2022. Visa - the credit card company became a top-tier Fifa partner in 2007, taking over from rivals Mastercard in controversial circumstances, and recently extended its relationship until 2022.  It is a sponsor of five Fifa events this year, including the Women's World Cup in Canada. Budweiser - the US beverage has been a World Cup sponsor since the 1986 event in Mexico, and is the Official Beer of the tournament, with its product on sale in all stadiums at the finals, and it also sponsors the Man of the Match award at each game. McDonald's - the American fast food chain has been a sponsor since the 1994 World Cup in the US. Its products are available at all matches in the finals tournament, and it also sponsors the World Cup Player Escort programme, in which children accompany the teams onto the pitch. Meanwhile, it appears that Nike, which is not an official Fifa sponsor (but does come up with clever marketing campaigns around the World Cup) has also been dragged into the furore, with the US Department of Justice questioning its deal with the Brazilian Football Association. The American indictments state that an unidentified "major US sportswear company" is alleged to have been involved in the payment and receipt of bribes. The Department of Justice did not name the firm, but Nike and the Brazilian football federation have been partners since a $400m sponsorship deal was signed back in 1996. Nike did not confirm it was the company alluded to, but said it "believes in ethical and fair play in both business and sport and strongly opposes any form of manipulation or bribery. We have been co-operating, and will continue to co-operate, with the authorities." Meanwhile, the editor-in-chief of Dutch newspaper Nederlands Dagblad says he does not want to see any adverts from Fifa sponsors in his paper until they have "converted". And the sponsorship industry's trade body in Europe is taking a dim view of the arrests and indictments. The European Sponsorship Association says that the developments "underline the critical importance of transparency and high ethical standards in sport and in business". They said that sponsors did not want to be associated with alleged "shady practices" and were "increasingly asking rights-owners tough questions on a range of compliance and corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues".	It has not been an easy week for the big multinational corporations that sponsor football's world governing body Fifa.
Jordan Burrow tripped James Jennings in the Town box, and Parkin put the visitors ahead from the rebound after his penalty was saved by Sam Johnson. Frear made it 2-0 before the break when he fired in Keanu Marsh-Brown's cross. Darren Carter's shot hit the bar for Rovers in the second half, while Halifax struggled to create chances. Forest Green assistant Jamie Day told BBC Radio Gloucestershire: Media playback is not supported on this device "They were on a good run of games - 13 unbeaten - so we knew it was going to be a tough match, but I thought the boys dug in today and showed quality when needed and fully deserved the win. "The way Cheltenham are playing as well, we need to keep winning games. "We've had two really good runs during the course of the season and we want to keep it going."	Goals from Jon Parkin and Elliott Frear helped promotion-chasing Forest Green Rovers end Halifax Town's 13-match unbeaten run in the National League.
Jack Mackreth and Chris Holroyd both fired wide as the visitors pressed for an opener in the first half. Danny Rowe finally put the Silkmen ahead after the break with a deflected strike, and Mitch Hancox slotted in to make it 2-0 shortly after. Danny Whittaker's shot put the result beyond doubt, before Wrexham's Jordan White put a late penalty over the bar. The result lifts Macclesfield up to seventh in the table, seven points outside the play-off places, while Wrexham remain 15th. Match ends, Wrexham 0, Macclesfield Town 3. Second Half ends, Wrexham 0, Macclesfield Town 3. Curtis Tilt (Wrexham) is shown the yellow card. Goal!  Wrexham 0, Macclesfield Town 3. Danny Whitaker (Macclesfield Town).

Moseley Road Baths in Birmingham and Wentworth Woodhouse near Rotherham, Yorkshire, are listed on the 2016 World Monuments Watch. The list hails the pools as a "rare survival" and the mansion an "architectural masterpiece". Maintenance bills threaten both. Moseley Road Baths is the oldest of only three Grade II-listed swimming pools still in use in the UK. Owned by Birmingham City Council, the building is scheduled for closure in 2016. The Friends of Moseley Road Baths is campaigning for the repair and restoration of the complex so it can continues as an operational swimming pool. An estimated Â£42m needs to be spent on Wentworth Woodhouse to address structural damage, plasterwork falling from the ceilings and wet and dry rot taking hold in the historic interiors, said World Monument Watch. The Wentworth Woodhouse Preservation Trust's long-term vision proposes extensive public opening of the house and gardens and residential, business and events uses for various parts of the estate. John Darlington, executive director of World Monuments Fund Britain said: "Wentworth Woodhouse is an extraordinary building. Its enormous scale is matched by the historic importance of its interiors - representing a roll-call of great British craftsmen - and by the intriguing stories of politics, industry and social change that reverberate within." He added: "Moseley Road Baths is a rare survival: a public building that echoes the class and gender divisions of the early 20th century, but one that is still cherished by local communities today." The 2016 World Monument Watch list also includes the Kua Ruins in Tanzania - the remains of a medieval Swahili town at risk from the effects of a harsh climate and looters. Also on the list is Dalieh Raouche in Beruit, a coastal promenade that is the latest victim of a development frenzy that has destroyed many of the city's open spaces. And the near-forgotten remains of World War II concentration camps in Italy are listed as at risk.	An Edwardian swimming baths and an 18th century country mansion are among the most under-threat buildings in the world, according to a heritage group.
The first earthquake near Dingxi city had a magnitude of 5.98 and was shallow, with a depth of just 9.8 km (6 miles), the US Geological Survey said. Just over an hour later, a magnitude 5.6 quake hit the same area, it added. In 2008, an earthquake in Sichuan province left up to 90,000 people dead and millions homeless. A factory worker in Minxian county told AFP that he felt "violent shaking" and "ran to the yard of the [factory] plant immediately". "Our factory is only one floor. When I came to the yard, I saw an 18-storey building, the tallest in our county, shaking ferociously, especially the 18th floor," he said. The area has been hit by 371 aftershocks, according to the Earthquake Administration of Gansu province. Tremors were felt in the provincial capital, Lanzhou, and as far away as Xian, 400km (250 miles) to the east. At least 5,600 houses in the province's Zhangxian county are seriously damaged and 380 have collapsed, while some areas suffered from power cuts or mobile communications being disrupted, the earthquake administration added. "Many have been injured by collapsed houses," a doctor based in Minxian county was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. "Many villagers have gone to local hospitals along the roads." The earthquake has caused a direct economic loss of 198 million yuan ($32m; Â£21m), the Dingxi government said on its microblog. Both the Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang had called Gansu province to express their concern for the victims and stress the importance of the rescue operations being conducted well, the Dingxi government added. Crews of fire fighters and rescue dogs have already arrived at the scene, the BBC's Celia Hatton in Beijing reports. In pictures: Quakes aftermath The closer to the surface an earthquake strikes, the more damage it can cause, our correspondent adds. The earthquake reportedly triggered a series of mudslides and landslides, making it difficult for rescuers to access some areas hit by the quake. The Gansu military police have deployed 500 soldiers, including 120 specialist rescuers, while 500 emergency tents and 2,000 quilts are also being transported to affected areas, Xinhua added. Officials from the civil affairs, transportation and earthquake departments were also visiting local towns to assess the damage, a statement on the Dingxi party website said. Rain is expected in the region later, leading to fears that this will make rescue efforts more difficult, or cause more landslides. "Showery weather is expected tomorrow, and lighter rain the day after that. The rain may have an adverse effect on rescue efforts - please pay attention and be on guard!" the Dingxi government wrote on its microblog. Residents in towns near the earthquake also reported feeling the tremors. "You could see the chandeliers wobble and the windows vibrating and making noise, but there aren't any cracks in the walls," AP news agency quoted a clerk at Wuyang Hotel, about 40 km (25 miles) from the epicentre, as saying. "Shop assistants all poured out onto the streets when the shaking began," the clerk said.	Two powerful earthquakes have struck China's north-west Gansu province, killing at least 75 people and leaving more than 400 others injured.
Hasbro, the maker of My Little Pony, approached Mattel about a deal late last year, according to Bloomberg news. The combination of the two toy-makers would produce a company with a $20bn market capitalization as of Wednesday. In 1996, Mattel made a $5.2bn (Â£3.5bn) offer to buy Hasbro, but the two sides failed to reach a final agreement. Over the last few years, Mattel has lost market share to Hasbro and Denmark's Lego. Lego overtook Mattel as the world's largest toy-marker in 2014. In its most recent quarter, Mattel reported a 4% drop in worldwide sales and expects sales to decline this year. That is partly because Hasbro has taken over the contract to produce toys based on the Disney movie Frozen, and toys sold under the Princess brand. Mattel estimated in 2014 that the Princess brand brought in $300m. In an effort to boost sales of its Barbie line, Mattel introduced three new body types and seven new skin tones in January. Sales of Barbie dolls fell 10% globally in 2015. Neither company has commented on the rumoured deal. Hasbro's share price rose 1.5%. In afternoon trading, Mattel shares fell back and were trading up 1.6% on the day. Hasbro reports its full-year earnings report on 8 February.	Shares in Mattel, the maker of Barbie dolls, jumped 8% on Thursday following a report it had discussed a merger with rival Hasbro.
I cannot see these women but I hear them fighting to reach the mobile phone that belongs to the inmate that I am on the phone with. Thangavelu Sarojini, a young Tamil woman, says she was tortured by her employer. "I still have wounds and scars in my hands, neck, legs. They beat me, pinched me and burnt me," she says from the Olaya detention camp where hundreds of migrant women from south and southeast Asia are held. Their crime, they say, was running away from employers to escape physical, sexual or psychological abuse. They are all now classified as illegal immigrants under Saudi law. "I was not paid for one-and-a-half years, they tried to kill me, then I fled to the embassy," Sarojini tells me. Hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankan women arrive in the Middle East every year and they are a major foreign revenue earner for the island.  But many claim to be ill-treated, tortured, or not paid for the work. In one notorious case in August 2010, 24 nails were removed from the body of LP Ariyawathie, a 49-year-old Sri Lankan domestic worker in Saudi.  Saudi authorities have pledged to investigate her case but there has been no reported progress in the investigation. But it is not only physical abuse that forced these hapless women to flee their employers. Kusuma Nandani, a mother-of-two who has not returned to Sri Lanka since 1993, says she was not paid by her employer for at least 15 years. She says that she suffered stress and depression because her employers did not allow her to keep in touch with her husband, son and daughter in Sri Lanka. As Kusuma Nandani cannot read or write, she was was only able to write a few letters - and then only with the help of other Sri Lankans. One day, she was told by the employer that she would not be paid anymore after she forgot to hand over pocket money to the children before dropping them off at school. From then, she says she was imprisoned by her employers for more than a decade. Rescued by the Sri Lankan embassy officials in Riyadh in 2009 after a tip-off, she has been a detainee at the camp since then. Her daughter says she is puzzled as to why the Sri Lankan embassy authorities have not been able to send her mother home even though Kusuma was granted an exit visa some time ago. WG Mala Mangalika is another maid who fled alleged ill-treatment. She says she was told to work without pay for more than a year because her employer paid a Sri Lankan agency nearly 7,000 riyal ($1,866). Now she is facing a lawsuit filed by the employer. "The employer says he has paid to the agency for four years so he would not allow me to go back," says Mala Mangalika. Detention centre inmates say that although Sri Lankan officials helped when they first arrived at the embassy, they are concerned about the delay in sending them back home. Apart from those in the camp, hundreds more abused maids are currently staying in an embassy hostel. Their plight is worsened because they become illegal immigrants as soon as they leave their employers, the legal "sponsor" for their work permits. Human Rights Watch (HRW) has long been campaigning for more protection for domestic workers in the Middle East and has called for migrant domestic workers to be included into local labour laws so that they are better protected. "My legs are still swollen and blackened after I fell from upstairs," Mala Senananayake weeps as she grabs the phone from others in the queue in Olaya camp, in Saudi Arabia. "I have no one in Sri Lanka. My parents are gone, my husband is trying to divorce me, I have only daughter who doesn't know who to approach to get help." "Please sir, please help me to go back to Sri Lanka," she repeatedly begs me. The labour officer at the Sri Lankan embassy in Riyadh told the BBC that the files of the detainees at Olaya camp have been transferred to the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau (SLFEB) in Colombo. But SLFEB head Kingsley Ranawaka did not answer repeated telephone calls to get a response. In an open letter to the governments of Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Sri Lanka, HRW urged them to  "ensure a timely and comprehensive response" to alleged abuse and implement "systemic reforms to prevent such abuses in future". It has urged Saudi Arabia to "prosecute alleged perpetrators, allow victims to return to their home countries before the trial and seek both criminal penalties and financial compensation". It also wants the cancellation of the Kafala system that requires the consent of the employer to repatriate migrant workers. The BBC has had no response from the media office of the embassy of Saudi Arabia in London.	"Please, sir... help us to go back to Sri Lanka," one woman after another cries and pleads over the phone from a detention centre in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
In particular, she likes fancy china and plates, and is happy to show off her latest purchase. She ordered a platter online, and took it out of the bubble wrap excitedly. She bought that item, and some more china, toiletries and a bike, on a cashback website so she is expecting about £14 to be paid back to her. But Ms Sen might have to be patient. It will take up to four months for her to be paid. Cashback sites are a simple idea. Instead of going directly to a shop, you access a retailer's online store through a link from a cashback website. You still receive your item directly from the retailer, but you also get some money from the cashback website. It is often a percentage of the total price you paid. The sites have links to retailers of everything from groceries and toiletries, to insurance policies and broadband deals. But Ms Sen has not actually had any money back yet. "I thought it was going to be as easy as one-two-three, just make the purchase to the website and get the cash back the next day," she said. "But that didn't happen. It's been well over a month and I'm still waiting for it." Ms Sen thinks the website is not clear enough about how long that wait will be. "I have no idea how long it's going to take me to get the cash back," she said. She went through one of the biggest cashback sites, Quidco. It says it has more than 2 million members in the UK, and that the average user can make £262 a year. That is small change for its more committed users. Quidco says more than a hundred of them have made over £10,000. But, like all cashback websites, its customers can face long waits for their money to start coming in. Andy Oldham is the company's managing director and said every attempt is made to be clear and transparent. "That's the whole ethos of the site," he said. "On every single merchant page, we've got statistics that show the time it takes for those transactions to be paid out." For example, with the bike Ms Sen bought, the information about the length of time is displayed underneath the deal. We pointed this out to Ms Sen, who said she had never noticed the warning before. She thinks that four months is too long to wait for her money. "It's right down the bottom of the page," she said. "Look how light the shade of the font is. It's just not prominent enough. They need to make it clearer," she added. Despite all this, she says she will carry on using cashback websites. "My attitude is, it's better than getting no money back at all," she said. Quidco's Andy Oldham said he would take Ms Sen's feedback on board. He admitted there was "quite possibly" an argument for rethinking how this information is shown on the website. Mr Oldham maintains that it is impossible to give an average waiting time, because it depends on different retailers and products. So, if you are buying something like food, that will be consumed quickly, you should be paid relatively quickly. On the other hand, if you book a holiday six months in advance, you will not be paid until after you come home. Mr Oldham says it was important that customers realised that cashback arrangements do not pay out immediately. "We're very much dependent on the retailer paying us the advertising commission before we pay it back to the consumer," he pointed out. Another site, TopCashBack, says it works hard to manage consumers' expectations about how long it takes to get their money. But on average, those customers may have to wait 12 weeks for their money to clear into their accounts. There are other things to be aware of if you sign up to a cashback website. Some, like Quidco, charge an annual fee while others take a cut out of your commission. Personal finance expert Sarah Pennells, from the website Savvywoman, says there are dozens of sites to pick from, so it is important to shop around to find the best one for you. "The first thing is to look at how much cash you're going to get back on the various deals and secondly, look at how they're going to pay you," she said. "Some pay by cheque, others by bank transfer, some ask you to set up a PayPal account. "The last thing, and possibly most important thing, is don't just focus on the cashback deal. It's got to be the right deal or buy in the first place," she added.	Swagata Sen likes her home to look good.
Kevin Whyman, 39, was killed in the crash at Oulton Park, Cheshire, at about 14:00 BST on Saturday. But TV and radio presenter Chris Evans, who created the event, said police had advised it would be best to carry on. A minute's silence has been held at the festival site and visitors stopped to pay their respects. Mr Evans said the crash in which Mr Whyman was killed was a "tragic accident". A visibly upset Evans told reporters: "Our condolences go out to his family, who have been informed. "The police have also advised us that the best thing and the safest thing to do is to carry on with the event, bearing in mind that there are 10,000 children here - and that is what we are going to do." CarFest organisers said the festival had resumed but there would be no further aerial displays. Mr Whyman, nicknamed "Jester", was a member of the Gnat Display Team and married with a young daughter. In a statement, Heritage Aircraft Trust, which runs the team, said: "Kevin was a Royal Air Force-trained fast jet pilot whose enthusiasm for flying the Folland Gnat was infectious. "He will be greatly missed by his family, the team and many friends. "Kevin leaves a wife and young daughter. Please respect the privacy of family members and of the team at this most difficult time." Shocked spectators fell silent as the plane suddenly nosedived during the display, before disappearing behind trees. Moments later a plume of thick black smoke billowed in to the sky. BBC producer Justin Bones, at the scene, said two planes had performed a low-level, close-proximity pass just before the crash. One of the aircraft had failed to pull up and crashed north of the circuit, he said. Mr Whyman, who started flying the Folland Gnat in 2005, was one of the founder members of the display team in 2007. He lived in Westminster, central London, and split his leisure time between the airfield during the summer months and the ski slopes of the Swiss Alps during the winter. An Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) spokesman said it would be investigating the incident and sending a team to the site. Cheshire Police is also investigating. Mr Whyman, who was born in Chester, was a Cambridge University economics graduate. He trained with the university's boat club and coxed Cambridge to victory in the 1996 and 1997 boat races against Oxford. He had a career with the RAF from 1998 to 2001, when he left for a trading job with a US investment bank in the City of London. He completed his civilian flying licences so that he could continue to fly. Evans is a car enthusiast and was recently named as the new presenter of the BBC's Top Gear show. CarFest is described on its Twitter profile as his "dream of the perfect family festival", featuring cars, planes and music while raising money for BBC Children In Need. The weekend event in Cheshire began on Friday and a second festival is due to be held in Hampshire later this month.	The CarFest motoring event has resumed, a day after the death of a pilot whose aircraft plummeted from the sky during an aerial display.
Four-month-old Eli Cox was found at an address in Lapwing Close in Minster, Sheppey, on 13 April and died in hospital on 27 April, Kent Police said. Katherine Cox, 32, and Danny Shepherd, 25, both of Millfield Road, Faversham, appeared at Medway Magistrates' Court on Tuesday. Both were released on conditional bail. Ms Cox and Mr Shepherd are also accused of one count of causing or allowing serious injury to a child and one count of possession of a class B drug (amphetamine). They are due to appear at Maidstone Crown Court on 13 December.	A man and a woman have appeared in court charged with causing or allowing the death of a baby.
But thanks to the controversy around gifts to David Cameron from his mother, IHT is now under the political spotlight. Just 40,100 families - that's around 8% of estates - will pay any IHT at all in 2016/17, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Thanks to rising house prices, that number is set to rise over the next few years, but much more slowly than was originally expected. That's because the chancellor, George Osborne, has finally been able to make changes to IHT - changes that were blocked by the Liberal Democrats during the years of coalition government. So how does IHT work - and what reforms are already in the pipeline? If you pass on property, or anything else of monetary value, to your descendants, you will pay IHT, but only if the total value exceeds £325,000 in 2016/17. Anything above that amount will incur tax at 40%. Since married or civil partners can transfer assets free of tax between each other, one partner automatically inherits the other's allowance. So in practice, the IHT allowance is often doubled to £650,000. In other words, if a father passes wealth to a mother, who subsequently also dies, she can pass on up to £650,000 without having to pay IHT. From April 2017, the government will introduce a new Transferable Main Residence Allowance (TMRA), to help people pass on property to their descendants. Initially this will be set at £100,000, rising to £175,000 by 2020/21. When added to the IHT threshold of £325,000, it will allow each individual to pass on £425,000 with no tax payable - or £850,000 per couple. By 2021, the tax-free limit will be £500,000 each, or £1m for married or civil partners. Further details of TMRA can be found here Even if a parent sets up a trust in favour of a child, inheritance tax is still payable. In most cases, IHT will be charged at 20% on money or property when it goes into the trust, if it exceeds the IHT allowance. If the parent dies within seven years, an additional 20% is charged, to equal the 40% non-trust rate. In addition, assets within a trust are usually re-assessed every ten years, to take account of changing property valuations, for example. Under the existing rules, you can pass on money, property or possessions without paying any tax, as long as you survive for seven years after giving it to the recipient. If you die within the seven year period, and you gift more than the allowance, a taper system exists. If you die six years after making the gift, for example, you will only pay 8% IHT. See table below. In addition you can give up to £250 a year to as many people as you like without paying tax. Usually it is the estate which is liable for IHT. However if you are the recipient of a gift, and the giver has died within 7 years, and has already given away more than £325,000, you could be liable to pay IHT yourself. More details on gifts Anyone can give away up to £3,000 a year, and pay no tax. This is known as the annual exemption. If unused, this allowance can be carried over to the following year, up to a maximum of £6,000. In addition, if you can show that the gift was funded out of income - as opposed to savings - you will not pay IHT. But you may have to prove that the living standards of the deceased person were not reduced as a result. The rules around wedding - or civil partnership - gifts are different again. Providing the gifts are made at the time of the wedding, there are allowances as follows:	Very few people pay inheritance tax (IHT) and it raises relatively little money for the Treasury.
Mark Piper is jointly charged with murdering Levi Blu. Levi died in 2013 of internal bleeding. His mother Danielle Cassin is also accused of murder. A woman told a jury at Birmingham Crown Court she saw Mr Piper being violent with his other child, who was five at the time, in 2012. The incident happened in the living room of Mr Piper's Chelmsley Wood home after he banned the youngster from playing on a games console, she said. The witness said Mr Piper swore at his son and dragged him out the room before poking and prodding him in the face by the stairs. "He (the child) was crying," said the woman, who met 31-year-old Mr Piper through a mutual friend. "He punched him in his stomach at the same time on the stairs. It was hard, enough to hurt him. "I have never seen anyone hitting a kid like that. It was rough. It was how you would hit your friends messing about. The little boy was crying. He was really upset." But Paul Lewis QC, defending Mr Piper, wanted to know why the punch was not mentioned in her original police statement. "I was lying (to the police)," she said. "I didn't want to seem like a grass." Mr Lewis questioned how she could be sure about the words Mr Piper had used when she made her police statement months after the incident. He highlighted a message sent by the witness about Piper which said: "He loves all his kids and looks after them well. I just don't understand all this." Levi was found at the flat his parents shared in Nightingale Avenue, Chelmsley Wood, on 20 February 2013. Both Ms Cassin, 27, of Frensham Close, Chelmsley Wood, and Mr Piper, of no fixed abode, deny murder. They also deny causing or allowing the death of Levi and causing him suffering. The trial continues.	A man accused of murdering his 22-month-old son in Birmingham had previously punched his other son in the stomach, a court heard.
Rachid Lamrabet, 42, who lives in London, denies sexually assaulting a 25-year-old man at Greyfriars Kirk, on 26 August 2015. The judge said the case was being deserted after a matter arose and he heard legal submissions. He added that there were "good reasons" for the move. The trial had only just begun at the High Court in Livingston on Monday. Dismissing the jury members, judge Lord Woolman told them: "In the light of submissions made to me I regret that I'm going to discharge you as a jury and continue this case until tomorrow. "I'm not in a position to tell you the exact reasons for that all I can tell you is that there are very good reasons. "I very much regret that this has happened, but sometimes matters occur which are outwith our control. "I regret and I'm sorry for any inconvenience caused to you." Mr Lamrabet, is accused of engaging in consensual sexual activity with his alleged victim but ignored him when he was told to stop. The charge states that he seized the younger man by the body, pushed him to the ground and raped him to his injury. English is not the accused's native language, and a Spanish interpreter sat with him in the dock so he could understand the proceedings.	The case of a man accused of a homosexual rape in an Edinburgh graveyard has been deserted and will restart with a fresh jury.
Barry Joy, 56 and Daniel Timbers, 28, died in a "fierce fire" following an explosion at digger bucket maker Harford Attachments in Norwich in 2015. The coroner said Mr Timbers had been standing in for his father who was ill. Post-mortem examinations said the men died as a result of the effects of fire and inhalation of fumes of combustion. The inquest was told staff heard a "loud noise" at about 09:00 BST on 13 July 2015. "Staff evacuated the premises, with some of them bravely trying to rescue Mr Timbers and Mr Joy," coroner Yvonne Blake told the Norwich inquest. She added, "Their bodies were recovered from the booth afterwards." Paint sprayer Mr Joy, of Spencer Street, Norwich and production operative Daniel Timbers, of Dereham Road, Norwich, were working in one of two booths bought from RAF Lyneham in Wiltshire when the base was closed down. Kenneth Stedman, managing director of Ipswich-based Industrial Powder and Paint Services, advised Harford Attachments on the transaction. The inquest heard the two units were "well kept for their age" and he advised the company that they would be suitable to be set up as they were on the airbase. The coroner said the jury inquest, which is continuing, would hear evidence about training of staff, policies on site and extraction equipment on the paint-spraying booths.	Two men who died in a paint-spraying booth were so badly burned they could only be identified using their dental records, an inquest has heard.
The men tried to take their own lives to protest against last week's assault on four Dalit men allegedly by the members of a Hindu hardline group. The Dalit men were assaulted while trying to skin a dead cow. Many Hindus consider cows sacred and the slaughter of the animal is banned in many Indian states. Last year, a Muslim man was lynched by a violent mob that attacked his house over allegations that his family had been storing and consuming beef at home. There have several other attacks across India where Muslim men have been accused of eating or smuggling beef. Protesters set government buses on fire on Gondal, Dhoraji and Junagadh highway on Monday and blocked a national highway and seven men allegedly took poison at separate protest rallies by Dalit groups, police said. A senior police official told BBC Hindi that a large number of policemen have been deployed in the region and the situation is under control. Last week, four Dalit men, believed to be tannery workers, were stripped and beaten with sticks by men claiming to be "cow protectors". After a video of the assault was released on the internet, eight attackers were identified and arrested. The victims are reported to be severely wounded and are recovering in hospital. Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel has said that her government was committed to protecting the Dalits and ordered an inquiry into the incident. Four policemen have been suspended.	Tension has gripped parts of the Indian state of Gujarat after reports that seven men from the low-caste Dalit community had attempted suicide.
The Celtic captain was unable to exert his influence as Rangers reached the Scottish Cup final on penalties. "I would look at Andy Halliday," said Ferguson when considering the key moments. "I thought he was exceptional. "Scott Brown is a fiery character and I think Andy met fire with fire and he matched him in that department." Brown missed an excellent first-half chance before Rangers went ahead and the Celtic skipper was also unsuccessful from the spot in the shoot-out after the match finished 2-2 at the end of extra-time. "I think Andy's quality on the day outshone Scott and he is getting a lot of stick," Ferguson told BBC Scotland. "He is the captain, you expect him to play. Whether he had an off day or not, I think probably Scott's role in the team is to get other players playing, but unfortunately for himself he didn't play particularly well. "But there were reasons for that and the reasons were Andy Halliday." Rangers were ahead twice, first through Kenny Miller and then from a stunning strike from winger Barrie McKay, who was voted the sponsor's man of the match. Erik Sviatchenko and later Tom Rogic levelled for Celtic. However, it was 24-year-old former Livingston, Middlesbrough and Bradford City midfielder Halliday who caught Ferguson's eye most. "Barrie McKay is getting a lot of plaudits - it was a wonderful goal - but for me, in that engine room, it was Andy Halliday," said Ferguson. "I thought he was phenomenal. A lot of people are making remarks about how much he was like my brother, Barry. "He is a Rangers man and you could see that throughout the game. "He played with a lot of aggression - but a lot of quality - and he drove Rangers on." Rangers have already won the Championship title and promotion, but Ferguson thought that manager Mark Warbuton would need to strengthen his squad during the summer in order to compete with Celtic in the top flight. "I think he's got a great philosophy in terms of the way he wants to play and, if he can add some quality players to that philosophy, I think Rangers could be a force next season," he said. Ferguson's fellow former Rangers midfielder, Stuart McCall, who had a spell as manager last season, agreed. "Obviously, Celtic will look to their side and look to strengthen, Rangers will be strengthening and maybe Hearts and Aberdeen too," he said. "All in all, it will be a fantastic Premiership next season and there will be teams who will think they can go ahead, but there is a long way to go. "Celtic will look back at chances that went begging and they hit the woodwork a couple of times, but I think Rangers can look forward now to a very good end to the season."	Andy Halliday's domination of Scott Brown in midfield was the key to Rangers' victory over Celtic, according to former Ibrox player Derek Ferguson.
Official data showed the US economy added 209,000 jobs last month, beating analysts' expectations, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.3%. The Dow Jones closed at a record for the eighth consecutive day, rising 0.3% to 22,092.81. The wider S&P 500 index closed up 0.19% at 2,476.83, while the Nasdaq rose 0.18% to 6,351.56. Analysts said the latest jobs report meant the Federal Reserve was still on track to raise interest rates later this year, which would be the third increase in 2017. Shares of banks, which benefit from higher rates, saw some of the most significant gains on Friday. Goldman Sachs was among the biggest winners on the Dow, rising 2.6%. Among individual stocks, Viacom shares sank nearly 14% after it forecast a drop in sales to US pay-TV companies and streaming services in the current quarter. Consumer review website operator Yelp saw its shares jump by more than a quarter after it announced the sale of its Eat24 business to Grubhub for $287.5m. Yelp also reported revenues of $209m for the second quarter of the year, which beat analysts' expectations. US stocks are in record territory this year. The Nasdaq is up almost 17% since January. The Dow has risen 11% and the S&P 500 is climbed almost 10%.	Stronger than expected jobs figures helped to lift US stocks on Friday, leading the Dow to another record.
The party won 33 seats on Thanet District Council, Kent, in May, making it the first authority in the UK to have a UKIP majority. UKIP councillor Jeff Elenor announced on Tuesday he was defecting to join the Democratic Independent Group. He joins four other UKIP councillors who defected last month saying they were unhappy with the council's lack of action over Manston Airport. They also said they were unhappy about what they felt was insufficient focus by the council on issues such as housing, mental health and disabilities. Mr Elenor said he did not feel the council was fulfilling its election pledge on Manston. In May, UKIP won 33 seats, the Conservatives 18, Labour four, and independents one - 29 seats were needed for a majority. UKIP now has 28 members, but remains the largest party on the council. Earlier this week, the US company seeking to purchase and reopen Manston Airport accused the council leader of holding up the process. The airport closed in May 2014 and was sold to a private consortium that plans to build homes on the site. RiverOak said it had offered the money to help with a compulsory purchase order (CPO), and in an email to the council leader, it accused Chris Wells of "throwing one road block after another in front of us in order for you to carry out whatever your real agenda might be". "Whatever it is, that agenda does not appear to recognise the will of your constituents, which is that Manston Airport be opened and operating at the earliest possible moment," chief investment officer George Yerall said. Mr Wells said the council was seeking further assurances that RiverOak could afford to purchase the site. The matter is due to be formally discussed at a cabinet meeting later this month.	The UK Independence Party has lost overall control of its only council.
Emergency services were called at 11:44 BST to reports a boat carrying a father, his teenage daughter and her two friends had capsized. Torbay inshore and all-weather lifeboats were called and the four were taken to Torbay hospital. The coastguard search and rescue teams from Berry Head and Torbay and the coastguard helicopter were also called. Specialist divers are at the scene and are expected to remove the capsized boat from near the entrance to the harbour. Mark Criddle, coxswain of Torbay's RNLI lifeboat, said the vessel was launched at 11:51 BST to reports of an overturned boat just outside Brixham harbour with four people in the water. 'We arrived on scene to find a 16ft speedboat upside down with a girl trapped in it," he said. "We located the girl and brought her onboard the lifeboat where she was immediately given first aid by a doctor and paramedic who were members of the lifeboat crew." He said the three other people who had been on the speedboat had been rescued by other craft in the area, including two jet skiers and a yacht. 'We took the girl back to shore where she was handed into the care of paramedics who took her to hospital. The three other people who had been aboard the overturned speedboat were also taken to hospital after being treated at the lifeboat station."	One person died and three others were taken to hospital after a boat capsized in Brixham harbour in south Devon.
The Columba Declaration commits the Churches to "grow together in communion and to strengthen their partnership in mission". Founded in two different branches of Protestantism, England's Church is Anglican and Scotland's Presbyterian. The two Churches will be debating the report over the coming months. The Church of England's General Synod will hold a debate in February and the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland will consider the report in May. The Columba Declaration appears within the Growth in Communion, Partnership in Mission report, which sets out the history of partnership between the two Churches and their shared beliefs. The report states: "The new arrangements we are proposing are modest and 'light touch' with a small contact group meeting yearly and reporting to the ecumenical bodies within each Church." The declaration has been authored by Kirk minister the Reverend John McPake, and the Church of England's Bishop of Chester, Peter Forster. They say the agreement will allow clergy and lay people from each Church to be welcomed into the other when they move across the border. The pact also recognises that the two Churches have constitutional responsibilities in separate parts of the UK. Rev Alison McDonald, convener of the Church of Scotland's ecumenical relations committee, said: "The joint report sets out clearly the shared foundations of faith of the Church of England and the Church of Scotland, which enable us to recognise one another formally for the first time. "This provides a sound basis for our ongoing co-operation and for exploring future partnership." The Reverend Dr Jeremy Worthern, Church of England secretary for ecumenical relations and theology, said the Church valued its "ecumenical relationship with the Church of Scotland and our relationship within the Anglican Communion with the Scottish Episcopal Church". He added: "There are opportunities for deepening both relationships as this report continues to be discussed and received by the Churches."	A report proposing an agreement between the Church of England and the Church of Scotland has been published, ahead of a debate by the Churches' ruling bodies.
The 85-year-old F1 supremo likened the sport to a rock concert at which the band turned up but could not perform. "We are not putting on a very good show," he said, in the build-up to Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix. "Imagine if people turned up to watch the Rolling Stones and Mick (Jagger) couldn't sing and the others couldn't play their instruments." In a wide-ranging interview with BBC Sport, Ecclestone also: Last week, the drivers wrote an open letter saying the decision-making process in F1 is "obsolete and ill-structured". Responding the following day, Ecclestone said he agreed with the drivers. But he told BBC Sport he thought the drivers were saying "probably what their teams had told them to say". Alex Wurz, the chairman of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association, was not immediately available to respond to Ecclestone's claims. Ecclestone added the governance of F1 was "nothing to do with me". On the issue of qualifying, Ecclestone blamed governing body the FIA for the new format, which was supposed to spice up race weekends. It did the opposite at the season-opening race in Australia, prompting teams to call for a return to the 2015 system. However, the move was blocked by FIA president Jean Todt. Asked if the new qualifying system worked, Ecclestone said: "Depends how you looked at it. The whole idea is we were hoping one or two of the hot shoes would be in trouble in Q1 and Q2. It didn't happen." He added the idea "wasn't mine at all" but the FIA's. However, he rejected calls for a return to the 2015 format because he felt that did not work well either. There will be a meeting of team bosses on Sunday before the race in Bahrain to discuss the qualifying system again. Ecclestone has said he would like to switch to a different system that either decides the grid by ballot or shuffles the order by adding "time ballast" to drivers' times based on either the result of the previous race or the championship order. Ecclestone also discussed the new fuel-efficient turbo hybrid engines, arguing he would prefer a return to the naturally aspirated V8s in use until 2013. "I said this engine would be a disaster and was criticised for that," he said, claiming the lack of noise meant F1 had lost some of its appeal. He also claimed only one engine manufacturer - Mercedes - managed to adapt well to the new engines, which meant competition had suffered. Mercedes have dominated F1 since the new engine came in, winning both the drivers' and constructors championships for the past two years. "Mercedes have done an incredible job with that power unit," he said. "It is unbelievable.  but it is not F1." Asked what F1 should be like, he said: "Like it used to be. I didn't find anything wrong with the V8s and neither did anyone else."	Bernie Ecclestone says Formula 1 is "cheating" its fans because the quality of the show is poor.
The unrest began when drivers erected barricades in a protest against harassment and roadblocks by police demanding bribes. When security forced stepped in, some local residents joined the protesters and threw stones at police. Some demonstrators are reported to have been beaten up. Thirty people have been arrested. Africa Live: More on this and other news stories Zimbabwe has become increasing volatile in recent weeks with frequent protests against economic hardship and alleged government corruption. Police say they have reduced the number of roadblocks following complaints. The economy has struggled since a government programme seized most white-owned farms in 2000, causing exports to tumble. Robert Mugabe, 92, has been in power since independence in 1980. Critics accuse him of using violence and rigging during recent elections - allegations he denies. Official statistics say most citizens live on just one dollar a day.	Police in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, have used tear gas and water cannons to break up a protest by minibus drivers.
The holders won eight straight races to triumph 9-8 after being docked two points for cheating in the build-up. Oracle surged to victory by 44 seconds to retain the Cup they won in 2010. The Kiwis won four of the first five races, making Oracle modify their boat and call Ainslie from the warm-up crew. The British sailing legend, 36, a four-time Olympic champion, was drafted in as tactician in place of American veteran John Kostecki and was instrumental in the US outfit's resurgence. "It's been one of the most amazing comebacks ever, I think, almost in any sport but certainly in sailing and to be a part of that is a huge privilege," said Ainslie. Ainslie combined superbly with Oracle's Australian skipper James Spithill and strategist Tom Slingsby, another Australian who won Laser gold at London 2012, to drag the syndicate back from the brink in the most remarkable turnaround in the event's 162-year history. "To be perfectly honest, we had a mountain to climb," Ainslie added. "We knew we had to sort ourselves out. We had to get the boat going faster. We did that. "The designers did a great job and we had to start sailing better. We got the momentum going and we started believing in ourselves. When you do that, you can become quite strong. " The New Zealanders, with impressive early pace upwind and slicker boat handling, opened up a seven-point lead (six to minus one) as Oracle's crew and equipment changes took effect. Media playback is not supported on this device But the US outfit, bankrolled by software billionaire Larry Ellison, were soon up to speed and won 10 of the next 12 races to lift the oldest trophy in international sport, known affectionately as the "Auld Mug". The Kiwis, led by skipper Dean Barker, came within two minutes of glory in race 13 in uncharacteristic light winds before organisers abandoned the race because the 40-minute time limit had elapsed. In the decider in fresh breeze and sunshine on San Francisco Bay, Team New Zealand edged a tight start and beat Oracle to the first mark. The Kiwis stayed clear around the second mark but lost the lead to the Americans early on the upwind leg. After briefly retaking the advantage, the Kiwis then watched as Oracle stormed ahead with remarkable upwind pace and remained clear for a comfortable win. I'm incredibly proud of our team and what they've achieved but I'm gutted we didn't get the last win we needed "What a race," said Spithill, 34, after only the third winner-takes-all final in the event's history. "It had everything. Man, these guys just showed so much heart. "On your own, you're nothing, but a team like this can make you look great. We were facing the barrel of a gun at 8-1 and the guys didn't even flinch. Thanks to San Francisco, this is one hell of a day." Barker, 41, said: "It's obviously very hard to fathom. We went out there to give it our absolute best shot. We felt we didn't leave anything on the table. It's very hard to swallow. The gains they've made are phenomenal. "I'm incredibly proud of our team and what they've achieved, but I'm gutted we didn't get the last win we needed to take the Cup back to New Zealand." As winners, Oracle will decide on the format, venue and timing of the 35th America's Cup. The US syndicate first won the Cup in 2010, when they beat holders Alinghi of Switzerland in a one-off match in huge multihulls following protracted legal wrangling. Ellison and Oracle Team USA boss Russell Coutts, who won the Cup for New Zealand in 1995 and 2000 before defecting to Alinghi for 2003, devised a new concept for the 2013 competition. They opted for revolutionary 72ft catamarans with rigid wing sails - and foiling daggerboards later pioneered by the Kiwis - which allowed the boats to reach startling speeds of more than 50mph. Races were brought inshore to make it more accessible for fans, while cutting-edge TV production with on-screen graphics were introduced to make it more appealing for a new audience of TV viewers. But the format was controversial and designs untested, with critics fearing for the safety of sailors. Oracle capsized last year, but it was the death of British Olympian Andrew Simpson in a training accident in May that prompted wide-ranging safety measures, including upper wind-speed limits and personal breathing apparatus. Critics also pointed to spiralling costs, with only three teams - Artemis Racing of Sweden, Emirates Team New Zealand and Luna Rossa Challenge of Italy - emerging to compete in the Louis Vuitton Cup challenger series for the right to take on Oracle. Artemis were unable to mount a meaningful campaign after Simpson's death, as Team New Zealand outclassed Luna Rossa in a one-sided Louis Vuitton Cup final. But despite Team New Zealand's early stranglehold and a number of races postponed because of unfavourable winds, the America's Cup showed that match-racing in giant catamarans can be hugely exciting and is likely to be the future of the event.	Sir Ben Ainslie's Oracle Team USA sealed one of sport's greatest comebacks when they overhauled an 8-1 deficit to beat Team New Zealand in the America's Cup decider in San Francisco.
Media playback is not supported on this device First-half tries from Vincent Clerc and Maxime Medard opened a lead of 16 unanswered points as England shipped penalties and made basic errors across the park. England struck back with a fine try from Ben Foden and closed to within seven points with three minutes left when Mark Cueto capitalised on a break from replacement Matt Banahan. But they ran out of time and inspiration as Les Bleus set up a deserved semi-final clash with Wales. France, so poor in their pool matches, were a side transformed as they took revenge for their World Cup defeats of 2007 and 2003. "England were blown away in the first half and probably got a proper telling off. They came out with a little more pace and precision but they made too many mistakes with knock-ons, penalites and turnovers. England were never going to score from 80m out. "Those who have watched England before could see they were not any different but whereas Scotland and Argentina couldn't last the distance and England won late on, France were a different outfit." The defeat will leave manager Martin Johnson under pressure after his gamble of pairing Jonny Wilkinson and Toby Flood at 10 and 12 failed to ignite the England back line, while his forwards were repeatedly second best at the set-piece and in the loose. Johnson's contract expires in November, and four weeks as memorable for scandals off the pitch as any achievements on it will do little to appease the notoriously twitchy committee-men at the Rugby Football Union. France were supposedly a team in pieces, beaten by Tonga just a week ago and with coach Marc Lievremont publicly berating his players, but so clear-cut was their victory that much of the atmosphere had been sucked from the contest long before the end. England had an early opportunity with a line-out deep in French territory after a clever grubber from Foden only for Lionel Nallet to burgle back possession, and they then tore into France again as Alexis Palisson was smashed backwards after taking a garryowen and Manu Tuilagi thundered into Morgan Parra. After spluttering sporadically for four games, England's Kiwi campaign ended as it probably deserved to: in defeat, to a team that was more dynamic, more clinical and far more composed when it mattered most. Read more from Tom's blog But it was the most fleeting of false dawns. Dmitri Yachvilli slotted a penalty from distance after Flood failed to release his man on the deck, and France took a grip they would never relinquish. Wilkinson was struggling, sending the re-start straight into touch and flinging a pass the same way, and France then went close to the first try of the contest as Clerc took a long pass out on the left and was just bundled into touch by the corner flag. Yachvilli made it 6-0 with a second sweet strike from 45 metres after Matt Stevens was penalised for collapsing a scrum, and then slid another penalty just wide from the same spot. England's players had talked of "blitzing" France in the first 20 minutes, but it was Lievremont's men with all the menace and danger. Another line-out was stolen, and when the ball was sent left Clerc stepped and spun through limp challenges from Wilkinson, Chris Ashton and Foden to dive over and make it 11-0. England were once again static in their few attacks, only Tuilagi's bullocking runs offering any threat, Flood reduced to aiming a long-range drop-goal pit which missed by a street. Louis Deacon shipped another sloppy penalty, allowing Yachvili to kick to the corner, and after thunderous drives from the forwards left wing Alexis Palisson and Medard combined out wide to put the full-back in for France's second try. England were in disarray, only Yachvili's failures with the conversions keeping them in the game, and when they finally created space for their wingers Cueto was dragged down metres from the line before another wayward pass from Wilkinson shut the door on Ashton wide out right. England had never before come back to win from a margin of more than 12 points, and the errors continued to come thick and fast as Tom Croft became the latest to cough up the ball. They grabbed an unlikely lifeline when Ben Youngs took a quick tap and go to release Foden, who jinked and dummied his way over to make it 16-5 with 23 minutes left on the clock, Wilkinson popping over the conversion for 16-7. Johnson threw on his replacements but England kept wasting what good field possession they could work. Flood popped out a careless off-load deep in the French 22 to allow a clearing kick to snuff out the danger, and when Nick Easter tried to rumble from deep within his own 22 his hospital pass to Tuilagi triggered another knock-on. France, led by man-of-the-match Imanol Harinordoquy, set up camp in front of the English posts, and when the ball was fed back to Trinh-Duc the replacement fly-half slotted the drop-goal to make it 19-7. Banahan's late charge allowed Cueto to touch down for a try at the death, but with Flood's conversion sliding wide England needed a converted try to force extra time - something they could neither conjure nor say their performance deserved. England: Foden, Ashton, Tuilagi, Flood, Cueto, Wilkinson, Youngs, Stevens, Thompson, Cole, Deacon, Palmer, Croft, Moody, Easter. Replacements: Wigglesworth for Wilkinson (65), Banahan for Youngs (65), Corbisiero for Stevens (49), Hartley for Thompson (56), Shaw for Deacon (49), Lawes for Croft (46), Haskell for Moody (63). France: Medard, Clerc, Rougerie, Mermoz, Palisson, Parra, Yachvili, Poux, Servat, Mas, Pape, Nallet, Dusautoir, Bonnaire, Harinordoquy. Replacements: Marty for Rougerie (68), Trinh-Duc for Yachvili (53), Barcella for Poux (56), Szarzewski for Servat (56), Pierre for Pape (65), Picamoles for Harinordoquy (72). Not Used: Heymans.	England's World Cup dreams fell apart under a French onslaught on a night when their shortcomings were brutally exposed at the quarter-final stage.
A 67-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident on the A7, a mile north of Stow. She had been driving a Volkswagen Polo which overturned after being involved in a collision with an Audi A6 at 16:35 on Tuesday. Police said a 95-year-old woman, who was one of two female passengers in the Audi, later died from her injuries at a hospital in Edinburgh. A spokesman for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said a driver and a passenger were trapped in one of the cars when they arrived at the scene. He said they were helped by a passing nurse, who administered oxygen to one of the casualties, before paramedics arrived and the injured people were removed from the vehicle. Police said the male driver of the Audi and a second passenger in his car were taken to the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh but they did not sustain life-threatening injures. Police closed the road for six hours following the crash and have appealed for information from witnesses. Sgt Brian Smith said: "Tragically, this incident has resulted in the death of two women and we are now working to establish exactly what happened. "I would ask that any motorists who were on the A7 near Stow yesterday and have information that can assist with our investigation contacts police immediately."	Two woman have died following a head-on road crash in the Borders.
Bill Palmer, from Southampton, called the Alex Dyke show on BBC Radio Solent about his life after his wife went into a nursing home. Dyke immediately ordered a taxi to bring Mr Palmer to the studio to allow phone-in listeners to chat to him. A recording of the call has been viewed tens of thousands of times on Facebook. The 95-year-old, from Sholing, married his wife Sheila, 85, on 2 June 2014 after they had been friends for 30 years. Shortly afterwards Sheila - who has dementia and colitis - fell and was taken into hospital. She was then moved into a nursing home, where she now lives. Mr Palmer phoned the BBC Radio Solent programme on Wednesday during a phone-in on "Love - later in life". Although he visits his wife every day, he said: "Every day is hell. I feel so alone". The production team immediately arranged to take Mr Palmer to the studio in Southampton, where he sat in on the rest of the show. Mr Palmer said: "I just sit with my wife and we tell each other we love each other, and that's it. "She knows who I am and she often says 'we did get married on the second of June didn't we?' - and that's when it hurts. "I listen to the radio and watch TV and have lots of friends, but unfortunately when you get old people don't visit - that's life." Listeners phoned in to offer support and advice to Mr Palmer. He was offered Sunday lunch, afternoon trips out and a ukulele orchestra to play for him, but he kindly turned them all down. "I didn't know such kindness existed," he told one caller. Dyke said Mr Palmer had "touched the hearts of thousands of listeners" and it was his "nicest moment in 30 years of broadcasting".	A 95-year-old invited into a BBC radio programme after calling in about being lonely has become a hit on social media.

Mahmoud Amir Alagha is working in four dimensions to capture digitally the way partial paralysis affects people's expressions. His research is supported by the university which awarded him a scholarship and supported him when, as a refugee from the conflict in Syria, he applied for permission to stay in the UK. Mahmoud began studying in Glasgow in 2014 but was only able to complete his postgraduate course because he received a fee-waiver scholarship from the university. The 28-year-old graduated with distinction in his Masters degree and hopes to take his research to a higher level. He is currently applying to do his PhD and the UK government has given him leave to remain for five years. Mahmoud has been using technology developed in Scotland to capture 3D images of moving faces. "This is stepping into the fourth dimension," he says. "Capturing 3D images over time." After capturing the images he superimposes a digital mask. "This mask is composed of points, could be thousands," Mahmoud says. "It is a mathematical construction so you can do decimation to make more points or reduce the number of points. "It depends how much is really clinically significant." Those thousands of reference points highlight how our faces move, or fail to move, because of injury, conditions such as Bell's Palsy or the aftermath of surgery, which can cause facial paralysis. Mahmoud say this technique could provide pointers to the correct treatment. He says: "Muscles move the face. There are a very big number of muscles. "Being able to decode the face by region, for example, you can know that this muscle that is being supplied by that branch of the nerve is being affected because it is paralysed or is weak. "Being able to study the region rather than the whole face, or both of them, gives us a new dimension into the management of these cases." Mahmoud, who is from war-torn Aleppo, was half way through his masters degree when he became a refugee. He says: "By the end of the first year, the situation in Syria got mad. I had at some point to apply for asylum in the UK and the asylum process was harsh. "I could not afford the tuition fees for the second year. At that point I was stepping into the unknown. I felt like I was losing my solid ground." Ashraf Ayoub, professor of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at Glasgow University, has been Mahmoud's mentor and supporter during his quest for refugee status. He says: "If it was rejected he would have been deported immediately. That would have been very dangerous for him and undermine what he had achieved in the first year and destroy him as a human being and as a potential scientific researcher." Practical support came from the university in the form of the scholarship, one of four given to refugee students. Prof Ayoub says it has paid off handsomely. He says: "Number one, the enthusiasm. He wanted really to break the mould and innovate the application of this technology. "He also brought to it some of his own ideas of how we take this further. He also conducted a very successful pilot study as part of his Masters degree that he was awarded with distinction." Since the 1970s, the Glasgow Coma scale, developed by two Glasgow university professors at the Southern General has been the global standard for assessing patient consciousness. Mahmoud wants to create a similar framework in his own field - the Glasgow Index of Facial Paralysis. He says: "How can you really diagnose a patient or not without being subjective, to say 'yes, there is improvement' or relying on a ruler to measure movement between two parts of the face? "Having something that will tell you precisely what movement is there, the speed, the direction, the pattern of movement, where you can compare before and after, that is something that will benefit the patients and will advance the management of these patients."	A postgraduate researcher at Glasgow University is developing new technology designed to help people with paralysed faces.
The memorial event will be attended by hundreds of firefighters, police officers, paramedics and volunteers in a chapel overlooking the crash site. Emergency workers and community leaders have organised the 22 November service. It will come three months after a jet crashed on to the West Sussex A27 during the Shoreham Air Show. The Right Rev Dr Martin Warner will open the service at Lancing College with a prayer for the victims. He said it would be an important moment for people who were caught up in the "sudden and tragic events" of that day. The names of the victims will be read out ahead of a minute's silence at 13:22 GMT - the exact time of the crash. Each family will then light a candle to be placed on the chapel's altar. The relatives affected will also give the readings. Personal reflections of the rescue effort have been written and compiled and will be read out by Sussex Police Chief Constable Giles York, West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service Chief Fire Officer Sean Ruth, and South East Coast Ambulance Service chief executive Paul Sutton. Two days after the crash, Assistant Chief Constable Steve Barry said he had  never before in his career seen anything like the Shoreham crash, in terms of its scale, tragedy and impact on the local community. Friends and relatives gathered for the funeral of retired engineer Graham Mallinson at St Mary's Church, Newick, on Thursday, The keen photographer had been hoping to capture shots of the Vulcan bomber, which was making one of its last appearances at the air show, when the vintage Hawker Hunter jet crashed. He was described as being a "very dearly loved" husband, father and brother who would be "very sorely missed".	The families of 11 men who died in the Shoreham air crash will hear the reflections of emergency workers who dealt with the disaster at a service.
From Thursday, payments for some benefits will be limited to the first two children in a family. The Child Poverty Action Group and Institute for Public Policy Research say some families will be almost Â£3,000 a year worse off under the new rules. Ministers say they are determined to tackle the root causes of disadvantage and make work pay. The changes affect families who claim tax credits and Universal Credit - which is in the process of being rolled out and is due to replace tax credits completely by 2022. The new rules mean that children born after Thursday 6 April into families where there are already two or more children will no longer be counted in benefit payments to their parents, under either tax credits or Universal Credit. And from autumn 2018, families making new claims under Universal Credit will only receive payments for their first two children even if they were born before Thursday. However, children already receiving Universal Credit or tax credit payments will not lose them for as long as their family's existing claim continues. And Child Benefit, which is separate, will be unaffected. The latest official figures show that 872,000 families with more than two children were claiming tax credits in 2014-15. And a similar number of families are likely to lose out under the changes, the researchers suggest. In 2014-15, two thirds (65%) were working families and 68% had no more than three children, say the researchers. Based on those figures, the researchers calculate that once the new policy is fully implemented an additional 100,000 adults and 200,000 children could face poverty. Among those affected will be families with more than two children who are not currently on benefits but who might need to claim in future because of unforeseen redundancy, illness, separation or death, the researchers warn. They also suggest that the policy could: "It may also leave women who become pregnant with a third child, for example through contraception failure, with a difficult choice between moving into poverty and having an abortion," they add. The researchers also criticise a lack of advance publicity about the change on the main Universal Credit website, particularly if the policy was intended "to inform parents' choices about having children". Child Poverty Action Group's chief executive Alison Garnham called it a "particularly pernicious cut because it suggests some children matter more than others". "It's also illogical because no parent has a crystal ball," she added. "Families that can comfortably support a third child today could struggle tomorrow and have to claim Universal Credit because, sadly, health, jobs and relationships can fail. "Surely children should not have their life chances damaged because of the number of siblings they have." A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman called the current benefits structure "unsustainable and not fair to the taxpayer and families who support themselves solely through work". "Work is the best route out of poverty, which is why our welfare reforms are designed to support people into employment," said the spokeswoman.	Changes to benefit rules coming into force this week could push 200,000 more children into poverty, say campaigners.
The German shepherd, which belonged to Cleveland Police, was being exercised near to Ormseby Stables in Eston when it bit a 28-year-old man. The man suffered puncture wounds on his arm and upper body and was taken to hospital. The dog handler also suffered an injury to his arm. The force has apologised and referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. A police spokesman said: "Based on an assessment of the animal it has been put to sleep. "This was not an easy decision for any of the people involved, but has been made in the best interests of all those involved." The incident occurred on 6 June. Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Ciaron Irvine said it would be "wrong to speculate" until the full circumstances were known. "What is clear is that this incident should not have happened and we must absolutely understand what went wrong," he added.	A police dog has been put down after biting a member of the public.
A total of 112 high street banks have closed since July 2015 - with a further 33 due to close their doors within the coming months. The research covered Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Clydesdale, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and TSB-branded banks across the country. All the banks said the closures reflected changing customer habits. Edinburgh has seen the greatest number of closures - with more than 20 banks to close in the city. In Aberdeen - nine branches have closed or are earmarked for closure. Over half of them are with TSB, but the business said it was set to open a new "super-branch" to meet the changing needs of customers. "We will be opening the first of our brand new purpose built sites in Aberdeen on St Nicholas Street later this year," a spokeswoman for the bank said. "The new branch concept has been designed in response to customer research and feedback." TSB said the branch would blend new technology and self-service consoles, alongside 13 face-to-face meeting rooms as their feedback showed 88% of customers wanted people on hand to help them. TSB - which was spun-off from Lloyds Banking Group in 2014 and is now owned by Spanish banking giant Sabadell - inherited branches from the Cheltenham and Gloucester brand. It has closed nine branches in Scotland with another seven set to shut their doors before Christmas. Even though many closures are in urban areas, rural Scotland has been hit hard. Eight banks are closing in Highland, with Aberdeenshire and the Scottish Borders losing five. In Moray eight branches are to close - the most closures per head of population. There, Bank of Scotland says new mobile bank branches - equipped with online technology and covering one extra route - will meet the needs of their customers. The bank's director, Mike Moran, said: "We'll still offer cash transactions, both to pay money in and take money out, but we'll also have digital capabilities so we'll have broadband connections, wifi connections on the mobile branch and we'll have iPad-like tablets." Bank of Scotland - owned by state-backed Lloyds Group - has closed a total of 28 branches in the last year, with a further 23 due to close before the end of 2016. RBS has closed 51 branches since July last year. Clydesdale Bank has closed 14 up to August - with another three branches to go by the end of September. Santander has closed seven and Barclays three. The banks maintain the void closures leave can be filled online and by apps, telephone banking, and mobile or extended branches in city centres. But the literal void left by the empty branches on Scotland's high streets could pose more of a challenge to fill. Paul Jennings, a commercial real estate lawyer with Aberdein Considine, said: "The bigger retailers are more likely to look first and foremost at the bespoke shopping centres and retail outlets. "I think the larger city centre bank branches lend themselves probably better to the restaurant and certainly to bars and coffeehouses and nightclubs."	Scotland is losing more than 140 bank branches over an 18-month period, according to BBC research.
By the time a baby takes its first breath many of the key pathways between nerves have already been made. And some of these will help determine how a baby thinks or sees the world, and may have a role to play in the development of conditions such as autism, scientists say. But how this rich neural network assembles in the baby before birth is relatively unchartered territory. Researchers from Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, King's College London, Imperial College and Oxford University aim to produce a dynamic wiring diagram of how the brain grows, at a level of detail that they say has been impossible until now. They hope that by charting the journeys of bundles of nerves in the final three months of pregnancy, doctors will be able to understand more about how they can help in situations when this process goes wrong. Prof David Edwards, director of the Centre for the Developing Brain,  who is leading the research, says: "There is a distressing number of children in our society who grow up with problems because of things that happen to them around the time of birth or just before birth. "It is very important to be able to scan babies before they are born, because we can capture a period when an awful lot is changing inside the brain, and it is a time when a great many of the things that might be going wrong do seem to be going wrong." The study - known as the Developing Human Connectome Project - hopes to look at more than 1,500 babies, studying many aspects of their neurological development. By examining the brains of babies while they are still growing in the womb, as well as those born prematurely and at full term, the scientists will try to define baselines of normal development and investigate how these may be affected by problems around birth. And they plan to share their map with the wider research community. Central to this project are advanced MRI scanning techniques, which the scientists say are able to pick up on details of the growing brain that have been difficult to capture until now. While in the womb, foetuses are free to somersault in their amniotic sacs, and this constant movement has so far hindered clear images of growing brains. But researchers at the Centre for the Developing Brain have found ways to counter the effects of these movements, building up full three-dimensional pictures while the foetus is in motion. And by placing the MRI machine in the neonatal intensive care unit at Evelina Children's Hospital in London they are one of the few centres in the world to have a scanner in such close proximity to the babies who often need it most, Prof Edwards says. This means the same scanning system can be used to find out more about the brains of the sickest and smallest newborn babies, he says. Daniel Rueckert, professor of visual information processing at Imperial College London, who is also involved in the research, says: "We are trying to look at brain connectivity in two ways: firstly, from a structural perspective, to find out which parts of the brain are wired to other parts. And secondly we are looking at functional connectivity - how strongly two brain regions are linked across time and activity." But Prof Partha Mitra, a neuroscientist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York state, says we need to be aware of the limitations of the technology in use. "It would obviously be a very good thing to know more about the circuits in the developing human brain. Much of what we know hasn't changed in a hundred years and has come from dissection studies. "But we need to keep in mind the imaging techniques we have are indirect - we can't open up a human brain and look at the connections while someone is alive so we rely on these non-invasive methods.  But there is a big gap between the real circuits in the brain and what images can show us." Prof Rueckert acknowledges that this map will provide a "macro-level" view of the developing brain and not be the "final answer". But he points to early results from the adult version of this project  - the Human Connectome Project, based in the US: "There is so much evidence already from the adult project that there are significant changes in the brain that can be mapped with the technology we have now. "It will be incredibly useful to be able to do this with the still growing and developing brain - perhaps giving us more time to intervene when things go wrong."	UK scientists have embarked on a six-year project to map how nerve connections develop in babies' brains while still in the womb and after birth.
Tomer Hemed supplied two goals and scored a third as Chris Hughton's side bounced back from defeat at Cardiff. Jamie Murphy and former City striker Sam Baldock had the Seagulls two ahead early on before Hemed latched on to Beram Kayal's ball for the third goal. Mark Little deflected the fourth into his own net, while Kieran Agard hit the crossbar with a late penalty for City. Victory for Brighton keeps them fourth in the table on an evening when the division's top four sides all won. Media playback is not supported on this device Hemed, a summer arrival from Almeria, scored his ninth league goal of the season to effectively wrap up the points on 56 minutes. He had already showed his creative side for Murphy's early finish from inside the area, and then Baldock's low drive from the edge of the box in the first half. The Israel international also went close to a second goal when he drilled a long-range shot just over the bar. On a night to forget for Lee Johnson and his side, they were denied a stoppage-time consolation from the spot when Agard could only strike the bar from 12 yards. Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson: "It was a frustrating night. We huffed and we puffed to try and blow their house down, but theirs was made of brick and ours was made of paper. "It disappointed me that we ran out of ideas after Brighton's first goal and there are no excuses. We weren't good enough on the night. "There is a positive in the fact that the bottom three all lost and another round of games has gone by, but we want to be looking up the table." Brighton manager Chris Hughton: "I was delighted the penalty didn't go in at the end because it would have put a damper on a near-perfect team performance. "We had to improve because the display at Cardiff wasn't good enough and Bristol have been in good form and we only won comfortably because we did everything right. "It was as complete a performance as we have put in all season. We are not a team who scores a lot of goals so to get four was very pleasing."	Brighton got their Championship promotion push back on track with an emphatic win at Bristol City.
The 54-year-old has left his job as assistant first-team coach at Barnet to join the National League club on a rolling contract. Waddock led the Shots into the Football League in 2008 with a then record points total of 101 and left in 2009. The ex-Republic of Ireland international replaces Barry Smith, who left the Shots at the end of this season after not renewing his contract. Waddock previously spent two years in charge at the Recreation Ground, before taking over at Wycombe in 2009. He later had spells at Oxford United and Portsmouth. His first managerial job was at QPR, where he previously made his name as a player. "It's a situation I never thought I'd be in, but I'm delighted to be here," Waddock told Aldershot's website. "I've missed the people here and I've missed the supporters. The atmosphere they created at home games was amazing and I loved that. "We have to be able to give them something to cheer about and we're going to try our best to get this place rocking again."	Gary Waddock has returned to Aldershot Town for a second spell as manager.
Darren Turk, 53, of Fontridge Lane in Etchingham, is charged with 14 offences including rape and indecent assault between 1996 and 2002. At the time he was a member of the care staff, and later head of care, at Frewen College in Northiam. He has been bailed to appear before Hastings Magistrates' Court on 1 July. Sussex Police said the charges did not involve any staff or pupils currently at the school. Frewen College is a day and boarding school for children aged between seven and 19 with specific learning difficulties such as dyslexia, dyspraxia and dyscalculia.	A man has been accused of committing sexual offences against boys at an East Sussex school where he worked more than a decade ago.
The Waking the Dragon tower was granted permission by Wrexham council back in February 2011. Businessman Simon Wingett is trying to raise £2.5m to build the bronze sculpture, cultural centre and gardens at Chirk Park. Councillors are expected to grant the extension at a meeting on Tuesday. The 23.5m (77ft)-high dragon with wings spanning 57m (187ft) would stand on top of a 41.5m (147ft) tower at the former colliery site. Mr Wingett has said the sculpture will rival other well-known landmarks such as the Angel of the North, but time is running out on planning permission for the project granted back in 2011. He hopes to raise £1m for the visitor attraction from the public, with the rest of the cash raised through loans from Finance Wales and grants from the Welsh Government. In a report to the council's planning committee, officers say the development would be a "significant tourism draw to the area". Councillors are recommended to approve the extension allowing Mr Wingett five more years to commence building at the site.	A man hoping to build an 224ft-high Welsh dragon tower on the English border will ask councillors for an extra five years to start the project.
The British Speedway Promoters' Association, whose chairman Keith Chapman has been involved in negotiations to keep the club going, say an agreement has been reached. It has also been announced that a 15-year lease has been signed for the team's Beaumont Park venue. "Hopefully this is a new start for the club and it will have a good future," Chapman told BBC Radio Leicester. "Further meetings are now necessary to establish the management structure of the club, a racenight for the 2017 season and other arrangements," said a Leicester Speedway statement.	Leicester Lions' future has been secured following financial problems.
The concert was held amid tight security at the heavily protected Intercontinental Hotel. It was a rare music concert in the city. Kabul has witnessed a series of suicide attacks and explosions in the past few months. Saturday evening's concert was originally scheduled to be held in Ghazi stadium to mark the country's Independence Day. More than 3,000 tickets were sold at premium rates. But the authorities said they could not guarantee security at that venue. Ms Sayeed did not give up. She went ahead with her performance, but at a different venue. Her fans were delighted. "Despite the threats, I didn't think such a big number of girls would attend here. Fortunately, the number of women is bigger than men," said Bahar Sohaili, who attended the concert.. "I asked some of the girls: 'Why you are here?' They told me they were here to defy those who were against the concert." Ms Sayeed, described by her fans as Afghanistan's Kim Kardashian, is known for her long hair and figure-hugging outfits, which are seen as taboo by many in Afghanistan. Her music mixes traditional and folk songs rendered as pop. She sings both in Dari and Pashto, Afghanistan's two main languages. A day before the concert, I interviewed Ms Sayeed. She said she was determined to go ahead with the concert, despite the threats. "I am taking this as a very good excuse to be able to give a bit of happiness to my fellow Afghans, who are in dire need of it at the moment," she said. She has received a number of death threats from those who say her outfits and public shows are an affront to Afghan culture. "There are certain people in Afghanistan who have been against music, against celebration, against even New Year, Eid and everything. I feel like today we need to stand together and fight against it," said Ms Sayeed. "At the end of the day, we are also human beings and these are basic human needs - music, celebration, Independence Day, New Year." Ms Sayeed said she would donate the proceeds from the concert to the families of those killed by Islamist militants in an attack on the village of Mirza Olong in northern Sar-e-Pul province.	Hundreds of young men and women attended a concert by Afghan pop star Aryana Sayeed in the capital Kabul despite opposition from conservatives, and threats of an attack.
Gavin Roberts, 28, died of a brain injury on 15 June, four days after the collision on the A34 near the Compton junction in Oxfordshire. Megan Williamson's petition calls for the speed limit to be reduced. One month on from the crash that killed him she said "changes need to be made". "I just knew that Gavin would not want anybody to suffer as we have," she said. She wants the speed limit reduced from 70 mph to 50 mph, saying "people treat it like a motorway and it is a very narrow road". "There's no hard shoulder either, so if there are any accidents the emergency vehicles find it difficult to get down there." Mr Roberts was originally from Australia but had recently moved to Swindon where he worked for Network Rail. On the night of the collision, a Vauxhall Corsa travelling southbound smashed through the central reservation and into the path of Mr Roberts' BMW. Richard Hayes, the chief executive of the Institute of Highway Engineers, said Ms Williamson's suggestion would make the road safer, and called for the A34 to be upgraded. He added: "I'm absolutely sure [the barriers] are not as integrated as they should be... and that may well be eased by reducing the speed limit." The carriageway was closed 15 times in 2015 due to fatalities or injuries, and 56 times in the last five years, Highways England confirmed. A spokesman said safety was its top priority, and that it monitored the A34 on an ongoing basis. "Our thoughts go out to all those affected by the recent tragic incident," he said. Thames Valley Police said no arrests had been made following the collision and it was still appealing for witnesses.	The girlfriend of a man who died on a stretch of road where more than 50 people have been killed or injured in the last five years has called for tougher speed restrictions.
He's been disqualified in the final at Queen's Club for kicking out at an advertising panel. But it wasn't just the panel that felt his frustration - the sign broke and cut the leg of a line judge. Nalbandian was disqualified for unsporting behaviour and the match was awarded to his opponent Marin Cilic. After the match, Nalbandian admitted he went too far saying, "I am very sorry, sometimes you get frustrated on court." Maybe he should think about a new career in sport - karate perhaps?	Argentinian tennis player David Nalbandian might be wishing he'd kept a lid on his temper.
Pavey, a mother of two who only gave birth to her younger child Emily 11 months ago, ran the perfect tactical race to match the gold won by her old friend Paula Radcliffe in Munich 12 years ago. When France's Clemence Calvin - 16 years her junior and almost 20 seconds faster this season - went to the front with two laps to go Pavey tucked in behind. Then, at the bell, the Briton surged into the lead, held Calvin at bay on the back straight and kicked hard again as she came off the top bend to race to her first ever major title. She becomes the oldest female gold medallist in the championships' history, and having won Commonwealth 5,000m bronze 10 days ago seals a wonderful summer at an age when most athletes are long retired. Pavey told BBC Sport: "I just can't believe it. I was finding it quite a long way - I was thinking, is this the right event? "I'm really thrilled. I tried to do a controlled last lap, but when I got to the home straight I thought, just give it all you've got, so you don't regret anything." The time - 32 minutes 22.39 seconds - was irrelevant, Calvin hanging on for silver and her compatriot Laila Traby taking bronze. British team captain Goldie Sayers had given a speech on the eve of the championships asking her team-mates a simple question: "How would you perform if this was the last time you would ever compete?" Her room-mate Pavey gave the best possible answer. The Exeter Harrier has been running for her country for so long that she made her debut in a British vest in the same year her team-mate Morgan Lake was born. Across four Olympic Games she has secured three top ten places, but this was a glorious finale that few could have predicted. And on her lap of honour she ran to Emily and four-year-old son Jacob before embracing husband and coach Gavin and her own parents. Earlier, all three of the British men made it safely through to Wednesday's semi-finals of the 100m, Dwain Chambers winning the second heat in 10.18 secs and James Dasaolu the third, easing up in 10.22 secs, before Harry Aikines-Aryeetey took his in 10.19 secs. But France's Jimmy Vicaut, the only man in the field to run under 10 seconds this summer, looks the man to beat after an impressive 10.06 secs - the joint third fastest time in the championships' long history. World champion Christine Ohuruogu also appears to be coming into some form at the right time, winning her 400m heat in 51.40 secs, while Tiffany Porter is into the 100m hurdles final as the fastest qualifier. But there was disappointment for Britain's two 800m men, Andrew Osagie and Michael Rimmer, who failed to get through to the semi-finals, 28 years after the famous night when Sebastian Coe, Tom McKean and Steve Cram won European gold, silver and bronze for a British clean sweep.	Forty-year-old Jo Pavey became the oldest woman ever to claim gold at a European Championships when she won a thrilling 10,000m and got Team GB's campaign in Zurich off to the perfect start.
Handing over an envelope containing 50,000 Vietnamese dong (VND) ($2.4, Â£1.6) did not do the trick, but when she added another 50,000 VND, the referral was secured. The 33-year-old woman, who did not want to be identified, then gave an envelope containing 500,000 VND ($24, Â£16) to the medical staff at the provincial hospital, an amount that was more than two months of her income. "All other patients told me that everyone must give envelopes to thank the doctors and nurses for the treatment, and that was the rate for such an operation," she said. The staff did not ask for it but she believed that by giving the envelope her son would receive better care. She is not alone. Mrs Phin, a pensioner from a Hanoi suburb who lives on 3m VND per month, handed over an envelope containing 200,000 VND after eye treatment in hospital. But she was sent home before the treatment was complete. So she was admitted to hospital again and that meant another thank-you envelope. "It cost me another 200,000 VND to thank the doctors and nurses. I could only afford the smallest amount suggested by other patients," she said. Mrs Luyen, a retired teacher from a small town 35km outside of Hanoi, said passing over a cash gift for medical treatment was effectively mandatory. "Not all doctors ask for the envelopes but giving envelopes is a must when you go to hospital. It's in our culture," she said. In Vietnam, medical treatment is mostly subsidised by the state via an insurance system free to civil servants and children, or paid for privately or by employers. But queues for treatment under insurance cover are long and public hospitals overcrowded, while salaries for much of the medical profession remain low. And with growing capitalist sentiment meeting entrenched Confucian values, the practice of handing over a cash-filled envelope to secure faster or better service has become widespread. The number of people who gave envelopes doubled in the three years from 2007-2010 - from 13% to 29%, one study showed. In 2012, a survey published by the World Bank and Vietnam's Government Inspectorate (which runs the Anti-Corruption Bureau) showed that 76% of those who had paid a bribe to health service personnel did so voluntarily, with only 21% responding to a request. In an effort to fight corruption, five big hospitals in Hanoi launched a campaign in October 2011 to bolster ethical behaviour among staff, including a "Say no to envelopes" policy. Vietnam's Research and Training Centre for Community Development (RTCCD) also conducted a similar campaign to change perceptions of informal payments, using the media to raise patients' awareness of their rights as well as of doctors' duties. Nguyen Huu Ngoc, a well-known scholar in Hanoi, said the root of the problem lay in the Confucian gift-giving tradition. "In Vietnamese society as well as in Chinese, gifts stem from gratitude," the scholar said. "Showing gratitude used to have more spiritual value than material value. But over the years, it has become more material and less spiritual, and now in the market economy it is like a transaction." Culture might be used to justify the payments - but culture can be changed, according to Soren Davidsen, a senior governance specialist at the World Bank in Hanoi. "We know gift-giving is an important part of culture. But we also know that culture is not a static but dynamic thing. Several countries in East Asia, such as Singapore, South Korea and Japan, have a culture of corruption, yet these countries have found effective ways to curb corruption. "Although there is often the perception about culture being a part of corruption, we think that this is the wrong way of looking at it. And we can, by involving people, businesses and government in partnership, actually change culture," said Mr Davidsen. For many people, the line between a gift and a bribe has become blurred - something some people embrace as "an excuse to give envelopes", said Tran Thu Ha, vice-director of RTCCD. But for people who campaign to stop the practice like her, it is easy to identify what is a gift and what is a bribe. "A gift can be given in public or anywhere, it needs time to talk and to say thank you, whereas a bribe is often given very quickly and both the giver and the receiver are afraid of being seen by other people," Ms Ha said. But to change people's behaviour is one of the big difficulties that Vietnam is facing and will take time, acknowledged Mr Ngo Manh Hung, deputy director-general of Vietnam's Anti-Corruption Bureau. There has been considerable debate about how to curb the practice in the health service. One suggestion is raising health workers' salaries so that they stop accepting envelopes. But that alone will not be enough. Associate Professor Ta Van Binh, director of the National Institute of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders, believes that the government needs clear rules and tough punishments for medical staff who break them. But work also needs to be done to help patients understand that they do not need to give envelopes - and may themselves be breaking the rules if they do. Nguyen Huu Ngoc even thinks that there should be sanctions applied to patients who give envelopes to help clean up the industry. But this would need co-operation from all sides - patients, health workers and the authorities - and remains a big task. "It's not an easy thing to do because corruption is about money, people and power," said Mr Davidsen of the World Bank. "It's a huge challenge curbing corruption and co-ordinating anti-corruption efforts across government agencies. It is not a quick fix and can't be done overnight." There will be a series of special reports and articles this week as the BBC examines why bribes and backhanders are part of the system in so much of the world, looks at countries which have tried to roll back the tide - and explains how corruption works.	Three months ago, a woman from a village south of Hanoi needed her son referred to a provincial hospital by a district doctor for an operation.
The All Progressives Congress (APC) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections. It is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999. It lost the presidential poll last month for the first time. APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan. The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja. The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo. It also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east. Taraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory. Elections were not held in seven states. Analysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja The APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants. In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing. Why Jonathan lost? Buhari's historic victory Nigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll. Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended. On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state. It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999. Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader. The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says. It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections. The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.	The party of Nigeria's incoming president has won a landslide in elections for powerful state governors, ending the former ruling party's dominance.
Hatton made eight birdies and three bogeys in his five-under-par 67, while Fitzpatrick carded a level-par 72. They are tied with Australia's Marc Leishman (71) at Bay Hill, three shots behind American leaders Charlie Hoffman (71) and Kevin Kisner (68). Rory McIlroy moved up to a tie for eighth after a seven-under-par 65. World number three McIlroy scored the joint-lowest round of the day, along with American Rickie Fowler - who moved into a tie for 11th. The 27-year-old Northern Irishman started the round 11 shots behind overnight leader Hoffman, but five birdies on the back nine moved him up the leaderboard. "I just played better, held some putts, which was nice to see. I just had to put it all together and I did," McIlroy told the PGA Tour. "Hopefully I can be in with a shout and then if I get off to a fast start tomorrow, I can be right in there."	England's Tyrrell Hatton and Matthew Fitzpatrick are both three shots off the lead going into the final round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational.
There was a fancy dress theme of "pirates and princesses" for the 44th Boxing Day swim from North Beach. Sea temperatures were 11 degrees - slightly warmer than the conditions for spectators. The event, organised by the Tenby Sea Swimming Association (TSSA),  is expected to raise thousands of pounds for charity. It prides itself on always going ahead, whatever the weather. Before the main event was a raft race around Goscar Rock, held in memory of Dai Rees, of Saundersfoot, who regularly took part. The challenge was won by his brothers, Adam and Richard, who came home at the head of the nine-craft fleet. Tenby's mayor Sue Lane said: "It's been a thoroughly enjoyable morning and a pleasure to see so many people turning up and in such wonderful costumes."	Hundreds of barmy bathers have been taking part in Tenby's annual festive dip.
The move by Flintshire council is partly aimed at increasing recycling rates to meet Welsh Government targets. A report to the council's cabinet said if enforcement action fails, it will need to reconsider introducing three-weekly bin collections. From June 2017, all rubbish will need to go into wheelie bins and anything else will not be collected. Then from September, anyone still leaving rubbish outside bins will face fixed penalty notices.	Householders who persistently leave out too much rubbish in Flintshire will face fines from next year.
I give him the benefit of the doubt - his arguably blasé attitude, I think, is a symptom of being consistently called upon to defend his creation. He is the co-creator of Tor, the most popular software available for gaining access to the part of the internet unreachable using a conventional browser - including what is often referred to as the dark or underground web. To some, Tor is a menace: a (largely) impenetrable system that enables some of the most depraved crimes to take place on the internet. To others, it is a lifeline, the only way to safely access the online services that most of us take for granted. Dingledine would rather we talked about the latter. The scale of the dark web - with its drug deals, weapons sales and child abuse imagery - is insignificant when considered in the bigger picture, he argues. But we must talk about the former. I meet Dingledine at this year's Def Con, the large underground hacking convention held in Las Vegas. The timing was ideal - the event came just over a week after the closure of two huge dark web marketplaces. The biggest, Alphabay, was said to boast more than 200,000 users and $1bn (£0.7bn) a year in revenue. Dingledine's talk was the day prior to our meeting, and in it he criticised misinformed journalists for sensationalising the size and scale of the dark web. "I think a lot of it comes down to incentive mismatches," he tells me, "where journalists have to create more controversy and get something so that everybody will want to read their article. "The story is privacy is under threat around the world, and that's been the story for a while - so they need a new story." The Tor Project's website has a section called "Abuse FAQ". It is here the group attempts to address the most controversial side of Tor use: that it is an enabler of criminals intent on carrying out the most shocking and sickening crimes. When talking about this, Dingledine invokes the "guns don't kill people" defence. Tor does not commit crime, he says, criminals do. "I would say that there are bad people on the internet and they're doing bad things, but Tor does not enable them to do the bad things. "It's not like there's a new set of bad people in the world who exist because Tor exists." I guess not. But I suggest that Tor indisputably provides a way in which a novice can make themselves essentially untraceable online. "I still think that most of the bad stuff on the internet has nothing to do with Tor," Dingledine insists. "Most of the bad stuff on the internet is due to huge criminal organisations. There's a lot of crime out there." In layman's terms, Tor hides your identity by pinging your connection around many different servers across the world, making your actual location extremely hard to track. There have been rumours that law enforcement has "cracked" Tor but, aside from isolated vulnerabilities, Dingledine says the concept remains solid. "As far as I know, no, they haven't [cracked Tor]. "Tor is the best option there is out there, but that doesn't mean Tor is perfect. No software is perfect." Any major busts and arrests have been traced back to human error - good old, old-fashioned policing. "Which is frustrating," Dingledine interjects, "Because the modern police world wants to just click a button and have the bad guy show up. Old-fashioned police work is hard, takes energy." Tor was mentioned in the documents leaked as part of Edward Snowden's whistleblowing in 2014. Under the delicate heading "Tor Stinks… but it could be worse", the National Security Agency (NSA) noted: "We will never be able to de-anonymise all Tor users all the time." Given this, you would think the US (and others) would be taking every step to weaken Tor. Ban it, even. But in fact, the US government has done more than any other to keep it alive - donating several million dollars to Dingledine and team since the project's inception in the nineties. He is confident that funding will continue. "A lot of the US government funding for internet freedom tools comes from Republicans. The current congress is quite supportive of giving people tools to keep people safer on the internet." The reason? The FBI, CIA, military and others all value anonymity too. In their ideal world, Tor would exist, but they would hold a secret key to break in. In 2014, Facebook's London team announced it had set up a way for users to access Facebook through Tor. More than a million people use the site in this way every month. "About 97% of Tor traffic has to do with people going to Facebook, and Wikipedia, and BBC, and ordinary websites on the internet, and they want to go there more safely," Dingledine says. "Whereas 3% of the traffic has to do with this 'dark web' thing…. I have to wave my hands when I say the phrase." The ability to access social networks anonymously is invaluable to people living in oppressive regimes or countries with high levels of surveillance around what citizens do online. But given the majority of users can be found in the US and Europe - in places not typically considered to be oppressive - I argued that Tor's justification hinging on the needs of activists perhaps seems less than convincing. "I think the line is getting a lot more blurry between the free countries, and the un-free countries," he says. ___________ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370	When Roger Dingledine talks about the dark web, he waves his hands in the air - as if not quite convinced of its existence.
A blogger posted screenshots suggesting a Carmarthenshire councillor shared a Facebook post by a far-right group. The post said: "When a dog attacks a child it is put down. Shouldn't we do the same with sex predators?" Tegwen Devichand said she did not remember sharing the post and opposed the death penalty. Ms Devichand, who is Labour deputy group leader at Carmarthenshire council, said: "I couldn't put a horse down, let alone a human being." The post which Ms Devichand appears to have shared was initially posted by far-right group Britain First. Ms Devichand opposes plans to remove English-stream education at Ysgol Llangennech which were approved by Carmarthenshire council in January. "People should have choice, it shouldn't be forced on them," she said. The decision has been controversial with one Labour councillor Kim Thomas describing it as "segregation... at worst, apartheid". The decision has been controversial with one Labour councillor Kim Thomas describing it as "segregation... at worst, apartheid". Plaid Cymru has accused Labour members of working with UKIP to undermine the council's decision. She also said Labour had not contacted her about the matter and she had not been told the party was investigating. Ms Devichand said she was complaining to the police about a "hate campaign" against her. On Sunday Labour said a different member connected to the row had been suspended. Plaid Cymru Carmarthen East and Dinefwr MP Jonathan Edwards said over the course of the weekend "we have seen Labour members and an elected councillor exposed for sharing the propaganda of ultra-right groups. "This is in addition to another elected councillor branding Labour's own education policy as 'apartheid'." "Launching an investigation into the Llanelli Labour party is a welcome first step, but the party's head office must take swift and immediate action to stamp this out this type of divisive campaigning." A Welsh Labour spokeswoman said: "The Labour Party takes all complaints of this nature very seriously. The local party in Llanelli have made us aware of complaints and an investigation is under way."	Labour has launched an probe into complaints about members connected to a row over the move to change a primary school to Welsh-medium education.
The decision to call off the match was taken at 12:35 GMT following an inspection at Sportsdirect.com Park where part of the League One club's pitch was still frozen. The Latics are 22nd in the table and in the relegation places with Posh in sixth place. There has been no announcement as to when the fixture will be rearranged.	Oldham Athletic's League One fixture against Peterborough United has been postponed because of a frozen pitch.
The PRI is set to win about 30%, with the conservative National  Action Party on about 22%, said the head of the National Electoral Institute. On current projections, the PRI will see its number of seats drop slightly. The run-up to the poll was marked by violence with drug cartels blamed for the deaths of several candidates. On Sunday morning, protesters and parents of 43 students who disappeared last year burned election material in the town of Tixtla. They say they want answers about what happened to the students before elections are held. A dissident teachers' union also burned ballots and ransacked offices of political parties to express its anger at education reforms. Ahead of the elections, there was a great deal of pessimism - the feeling among many that votes do not really matter, politicians here are all the same, and violence will continue no matter what. But at a polling stations on Sunday, in relatively peaceful Mexico City, there was a sense of duty among many - that voting was the only way to make a difference. Asked what their main concern was and almost without exception, the response among voters was: 'Security.' People here are worried about where the country is heading. Despite President Pena Nieto's promises to restore peace in Mexico, these elections have proved otherwise. They have been some of the most violent in recent history. President Pena Nieto deployed federal police and troops to guard polling stations. His spokesman Eduard Sanchez said on Saturday: "Mexicans have the right to vote in peace... [we] will take all necessary measures within the framework of legality'' to protect the elections. Ahead of the polls opening, the CNTE teachers' union attacked the offices of five political parties in Chiapas state in the south of the country. In Guerrero state, explosive devices were thrown into a conservative party's office. Meanwhile in Oaxaca, as well as Guerrero, tens of thousands of ballot papers were burnt by protesters. A former mayor was shot dead outside a polling station in the same state. A number of candidates and numerous campaign workers have also been killed in drug-related violence.	Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and his Institutional Revolutionary Party will keep control of Congress, preliminary election results suggest.
It had notified the UN of its intention to leave last October, saying the ICC pursued "regime change". The opposition Democratic Alliance then argued in court that the government had to first seek parliamentary approval. But it may not be the end of the government's bid to leave The Hague-based court. Justice Minister Michael Masutha was quoted as saying after the court ruling in February that the government would consider its options. In the meantime, according to a statement on the UN treaties website, the planned pull out has been officially cancelled. South Africa's original decision to pull out came after a dispute over Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir's visit to the country in 2015. The authorities refused to arrest Mr Bashir despite him facing an ICC arrest warrant over alleged war crimes. Mr Bashir was attending an AU summit in Johannesburg, when the government ignored an ICC request to arrest him. The ICC has been accused of being biased against Africans. The ICC and global justice: A non-binding African Union resolution agreed in January called for the mass withdrawal of member states from the court, with some countries accusing the ICC of undermining their sovereignty. The ICC denies the allegation, insisting it is pursuing justice for victims of war crimes in Africa. Last year, Burundi and The Gambia, along with South Africa, also said they would leave the court. But The Gambia, under new President Adama Barrow, has changed its mind.	South Africa has revoked its withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC) after the High Court said the move was unconstitutional.
Media playback is not supported on this device An, ranked 132 in the world, finished on 21 under par, six shots clear of Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez (67) and Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee (69). England's Chris Wood (66) was fourth on 13 under, one shot clear of Italy's Francesco Molinari (74), who was tied for the lead with An overnight. The 23-year-old An's win is his first on one of the world's major tours. An was the youngest-ever winner of the US Amateur Championship in 2009, at the age of 17. Media playback is not supported on this device He became only the third European Tour rookie to win the prestigious PGA Championship in its 60-year history and his 267 total over four rounds also beat the tournament record by two shots. His victory, the first time the European Tour's flagship event has been won by an Asian, will see him climb into the world's top 60, secured his place in the US Open and Open Championship and a five-year exemption in Europe. "It's going to be life changing," said An, the son of two Olympic table-tennis medallists - his mother Jiao Zhimin represented China and his father Ahn Jae Hyung competed for South Korea. "This is the biggest event on the European Tour and there are a lot of benefits. I played really well today and had all the confidence going into the last couple of holes." An began the final round tied for the lead with Molinari and, despite picking up shots at the second and fourth, was only one ahead at the turn thanks to a hat-trick of birdies from Jaidee from the fifth. However, a birdie at the 11th and tap-in eagle at the 12th gave An a three-shot cushion that became four when Jaidee bogeyed the 13th. An made certain of victory with birdies on the 15th and 17th and a par on the last completed a hugely impressive performance from the Challenge Tour graduate. Bristol's Wood had a hole in one at the 14th, winning himself a car from the sponsors in the process.	South Korea's Byeong-hun An carded a final-round, seven-under-par 65 to win the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.
Government sources told the BBC that the tribal fighters set fire to a building used by the militants. The source said 10 IS militants and five tribesmen had died in the clashes that followed. Issa al-Issawi, the exiled mayor of Fallujah, said that more tribesmen were joining the fight against IS. Reports said the violence involved men from multiple tribes and IS members known as al-Hisba, who are responsible for enforcing religious strictures in the city. "Clashes took place between sons of the al-Mahamda and al-Juraisat tribes against the al-Hisba group," Mr Issawi told AFP news agency. He said the violence stemmed from tensions over increasingly difficult living conditions while Fallujah is besieged by Iraqi security forces. Sheikh Majeed al-Juraisi, a leader in the al-Juraisat tribe, told AFP the clashes were part of an uprising against IS fighters in the city and called on the government and security forces to help. Reports suggested the tribesmen had seized parts of the north of the city, but later ceded the ground back to IS jihadists. Fallujah, which is about 50km (30 miles) west of Baghdad, has been held by anti-government forces since the beginning of 2014 and is now one of two Iraqi cities still under the IS group's control. IS militants launched a sweeping offensive in June 2014 that overran large areas north and west of Baghdad, but security forces and allied fighters have pushed the jihadists back with support from US-led air strikes.	Local tribesmen have reportedly clashed with fighters from the so-called Islamic State (IS) in the IS stronghold of Fallujah in western Iraq.
Some 1.57m sq km (600,000 sq miles) of the Southern Ocean will gain protection from commercial fishing for 35 years. Environmentalists have welcomed the move to protect what's said to be the Earth's most pristine marine ecosystem. They hope it will be the first of many such zones in international waters. At this meeting in Hobart, Australia, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) agreed unanimously to designate the Ross Sea as an MPA, after years of protracted negotiations, New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced. The Ross Sea, its shelf and slope only comprise 2% of the Southern Ocean but they are home to 38% of the world's Adelie penguins, 30% of the world's Antarctic petrels and around 6% of the world's population of Antarctic minke whales. The region is important to the rest of the planet as the upwelling of nutrients from the deep waters are carried on currents around the world. The Ross Sea is also home to huge numbers of krill, a staple food for species including whales and seals. Their oil is critical for salmon farming. However there are concerns that overfishing and climate change are having significant impacts on their numbers. The proposal, introduced by New Zealand and the US, and accepted by all the other nations, will see a general protection "no-take" zone where nothing can be removed including marine life and minerals. As part of the compromise that emerged in negotiations, there will be special zones where fishing from krill and toothfish will be allowed for research purposes. "I'm absolutely overjoyed," said Lewis Pugh, the UN Patron for the Oceans, and someone who has campaigned for years in support of this new MPA. "This is the biggest protected area on the land or the sea, this is the first large scale MPA on the high seas, they are largely unprotected." The ocean advocate and swimmer drew attention to the Ross Sea with a series of swims in the icy waters - and for two years he has engaged in a series of meetings, dubbed "speedo diplomacy" with Russian officials to convince them of the value of the MPA. At the end of negotiations last year, Russia was the one country holding out against a consensus on the Ross Sea. But this year there has been what Mr Pugh describes as an "environmental glasnost". Russia's President Vladimir Putin has designated 2017 as the Year of Ecology and the country has recently expanded an MPA around Franz Josef Land in the Arctic. Sergei Ivanov, President Putin's Special Representative for Ecology, welcomed the new deal. "Russia has a proud history of exploration and science in Antarctica. In this time of political turbulence in so many parts of the world, we are pleased to be part of this collaborative international effort to safeguard the Ross Sea," he said. One of the key questions in the negotiations was how long the MPA should last. China is on the record as stating it believes that 20 years is long enough for a designation. Many conservationists say this is far too short, given the lifespan of creatures that life in the Ross Sea, such as whales. Ultimately, the parties agreed on 35 years. The designation was welcomed not just by campaigners but also by those with close links to the Ross Sea. "The Ross family are euphoric that our family legacy has been honoured in the 175th anniversary year since James first discovered the Ross Sea," said Phillipa Ross, great, great, great granddaughter to Sir James Clark Ross, after whom the Ross Sea is named. One of the other big concerns that delayed the proposal was the fact that it could set a precedent for other high seas negotiations around the world, such as in the Arctic and in attempts by the UN to develop a new marine biodiversity treaty. Lewis Pugh is very hopeful that this will be the case. And he's willing to keep swimming until it happens. "This to me represents a first step, I am heading back down to the Antarctic peninsula to carry on swimming, I want to see a series of MPAs around this continent that I feel so much about," he explained. "For me this is an issue about justice - justice between generations. There seems to be something fundamentally wrong with us destroying our oceans so our children and grandchildren have absolutely nothing." Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathBBC and on Facebook.	Delegates from 24 countries and the European Union have agreed that the Ross Sea in Antarctica will become the world's largest marine protected area (MPA).
The list includes five from the UK and one American author, Tania James, for her novel The Tusk that Did the Damage. Poet Andrew McMillan's Physical won The Guardian First Book Award last year. The Swansea University-backed award will go to the best published literary work in English, written by an author aged 39 or under. Chair of the judges Prof Dai Smith called the works "eye-catching, eclectic and totally energising". The shortlisted writers are: A set of short stories set in Caerphilly by locally-born writer Thomas Morris was on the long list but did not make the final cut. The winner will be announced at a gala ceremony at Swansea University, which sponsors the prize, on International Dylan Thomas Day, 14 May.	The shortlist for the £30,000 Dylan Thomas Prize for young writers has been unveiled.
The former Superior General of Missionaries of Charity was suffering from various ailments. She took over the running of the charity after Mother Teresa died in 1997 and ran it for 12 years before Sister Mary Prema took over in 2009. The Missionaries of Charity cares for the homeless and dying in Kolkata. Archbishop of Kolkata Thomas D'Souza told the AFP news agency that Sister Nirmala "passed away peacefully, surrounded by sisters praying for her". "She had been suffering from a heart disease for quite some time, but she never lost her smile and was always cheerful." He said Sister Nirmala "carried forward Mother Teresa's legacy of compassion, gentleness, service to the poorest of the poor and holiness of life". "Even after she ceased to be head of Missionaries of Charity, she served the people with the same zeal as she did before." Reports say Sister Nirmala's body will be kept at the Missionaries of Charity headquarters in Kolkata and her funeral will be held on Wednesday afternoon. Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the tributes to the deceased nun. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said she was "saddened" by Sister Nirmala's death. The Missionaries of Charity has about 4,500 nuns and hundreds of homes around the world.	Sister Nirmala, the nun who succeeded Mother Teresa as the head of a charity in the Indian city of Kolkata (Calcutta), has died, aged 81.
The prime minister "is committed to free school meals in England", an official spokesman told the BBC. The coalition government introduced the meals a year ago for all pupils in the first three years of school in England. But there has been speculation the meals are at risk, after Chancellor George Osborne demanded cuts of between 25% and 40% from unprotected budgets. The spokesman said the prime minister had made the point that "it was in the manifesto, the manifesto words are very clear - we're proud of what we've done with free school meals". The Conservative manifesto says: "We will support families by providing free meals to all infants". The chancellor called for the cuts in July, as part of his spending review, due to be published in November. The free school meals budget has cost about Â£600m each year, and there had been speculation over its future. But the Department for Education has indicated that free school meals will be protected in the spending review. "We believe that every child, regardless of their background, should have the same opportunities," said a spokesman. "That is at the heart of what we are doing with school food. "No child should be hindered because they are not eating a nutritious meal at lunchtime. "We have provided significant financial support to schools to help them deliver universal infant free school meals. "We have come a long way, and the new School Food Standards mean pupils of all ages are eating good food that sows the seeds for healthy eating for life." At the weekend some 40 top health professionals signed a letter warning that scrapping the meals could harm children's health. "It would be short-term thinking indeed for the government to cut the funding for universal infant free school meals," said the letter. The National Association of Head Teachers called for "a swift and unequivocal statement" from government that it would honour its general election pledge to fund a meal for all infant children. "That message could and should be delivered straight away," said NAHT general secretary, Russell Hobby. "Schools signing contracts with catering companies this term can't afford to wait until the November spending review only to find out the policy has been changed."	David Cameron has dismissed speculation free school meals for all infant children could face cuts.
Neil Aspin's promotion-chasing hosts have not lost in nine National League matches while Adam Lockwood's side are unbeaten in five. Guiseley went ahead on 15 minutes against the run of play when a throw-in found James Hurst who squared to Jake Lawlor to stroke into an empty net. Gateshead defender Liam Hogan superbly blocked Jordan Preston's effort and Guiseley keeper Jonny Maxted then saved well from Wesley York's shot just before the break. The hosts, who started the second half well, levelled on 62 minutes when a slip by half-time substitute Derek Asamoah let York curl sweetly into the top-right corner from the edge of the box.

Judge Thomas Lipps rejected arguments by defence lawyers that witnesses could face intimidation or harassment outside the courthouse in Steubenville. The case has attracted attention due to social media and the high profile of the football team in the small town. Judge Lipps also ruled the non-jury trial would be open to the public. He did so over the objections of the family of the 16-year-old girl who was allegedly attacked. She wanted to protect her identity and keep evidence that might eventually be ruled inadmissible from becoming public. Trenton Mays and Ma'lik Richmond, both 16, deny the charges they face next month at a juvenile court. Three other students who witnessed the alleged attack but were not charged are expected to testify at next month's trial. Those witnesses include two who took a video and photograph, then deleted the images. The Ohio attorney general's office told lawyers for those students last autumn that if the images had been found, they would have been charged. Prosecutors say the girl, who went to a school across the river from the city in West Virginia, was attacked after an alcohol-fuelled party last August. The case was thrust into the national spotlight after attention by bloggers and the hacker activist group Anonymous. Some claimed that the community had sought to cover up the alleged crime in order protect the two accused. The trial is set for 13 March.	An Ohio judge has ruled that the rape trial of two high school football players will take place in the county where the alleged attack happened.
Rhodri Colwyn Philipps, 50 - the 4th Viscount St Davids - wrote the message four days after Ms Miller won a Brexit legal challenge against the government. Chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot said she had "no doubt it was menacing". Philipps, who called his comments "satire", faces a custodial sentence. He was found guilty of two counts of making malicious communications and acquitted of a third at Westminster Magistrates' Court. One of the counts related to a post regarding Ms Miller, published on Facebook on 7 November 2016, which said: "Â£5,000 for the first person to 'accidentally' run over this bloody troublesome first generation immigrant." Philipps, of Knightsbridge, London, described her as a "boat jumper" and added: "If this is what we should expect from immigrants, send them back to their stinking jungles." Ms Arbuthnot found this offence was racially aggravated. The court heard how Ms Miller, 52, said she felt "violated" by Philipps's "shocking" comments about her. Ms Miller led a successful legal challenge which, on 3 November, resulted in the government being told to consult Parliament before formally beginning the Brexit process. Philipps, who defended himself throughout the trial, said his posts had been simply reflecting how he and others felt following this ruling in the High Court. He told the court: "My family motto is 'Love of Country is my motivation'." He said his comments were "meant to be a form of satire, a literary technique, iterated in my personal style, which may not be to everyone's taste, but is understood and accepted by everyone who knows me". Ms Arbuthnot, in a series of exchanges with the peer, asked Philipps: "Boat jumper, how can I see that as anything other than a racial, ethnic aggravation?" But Philipps denied the allegation that his posts were "racially aggravated" saying that describing Ms Miller as a "boat jumper" and that she should go back to the "steaming jungle" were "statements of fact not a racist comment at all". He added that he would not have made any serious threat "on an account where I could easily be identified". He added he had deleted the posts as soon as he realised that his closed circle of Facebook friends had been "infiltrated" and screen shots of the posts had been passed to Ms Miller. Delivering her verdict, Ms Arbuthnot said there was "nothing private about a Facebook post". The other post Philipps was convicted for was in response to a news article about an immigrant in Luton, who was involved in a row over housing. Philipps wrote: "I will open the bidding. Â£2,000 in cash for the first person to carve Arnold Sube into pieces." Kate Mulholland, from the Crown Prosecution Service said: "No-one should have these kind of menacing comments made to them or about them." Philipps will be sentenced later this week.	An aristocrat who wrote an online post offering Â£5,000 to anyone who ran over businesswoman Gina Miller has been found guilty of two charges of making menacing communications.
His lawyer Brian Webber told the AFP news agency that a decision over his early release has been referred back to the parole board. The Paralympic star was jailed for five years in 2014 for the culpable homicide of Reeva Steenkamp. He has been fighting a lengthy battle to be released early from jail. Pistorius was due to be released in August, but remained in prison after Justice Minister Michael Masutha made a last-minute intervention blocking it. The parole review board - the final recourse for parole disputes - met on Monday to decide if the star, 28, should be allowed out on house arrest. A definitive parole ruling is now unlikely to be made before the athlete in a separate legal process appeals against his conviction on 3 November in Bloemfontein. This ruling could result in him receiving a longer prison term. Mr Webber explained that the parole review board decided to refer the matter back to the original parole panel - the body accused by Mr Masutha of "prematurely" wanting to release him in August. There will not be much sympathy for Pistorius because many people felt that the judge erred by acquitting him of murder. The double amputee will have to remain behind bars because while his case joins the lengthy queue of other parole hearings that need to be heard, and there is no indication when this will happen. Legal experts say the decision by the justice minister Michael Masutha to intervene was correct in terms of the law. At the time of his intervention, Pistorius had been granted parole only six months into his five-year sentence. The law states clearly that an offender can only be considered for parole after serving one-sixth of his sentence, in this case 10 months. But because he has now served one-sixth of his sentence, he probably should be released by now. Prosecutors argue that the judge who presided over his trial did not apply the law correctly by acquitting him of murder. The judge instead found him guilty of a lesser charge of culpable homicide - equivalent to manslaughter. Reeva Steenkamp's parents are strongly against Pistorius' possible release, telling an Australian TV channel in August that the Paralympian has ruined their lives. "He killed her. He admits he killed her. She's dead. Why didn't he just let her walk away? Why?" Reeva's mother June Steenkamp asked in the interview.	Oscar Pistorius must remain in jail and not be transferred to house arrest after a decision to grant him parole was again delayed.
DUP leader, First Minister Arlene Foster, has resisted both calls to step aside and calls to resign over the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme. RHI is approximately £490m over budget. Sinn Féin's national chairperson Declan Kearney accused Mrs Foster and her party of "unvarnished arrogance" over the "growing political crisis". Writing in the the republican newspaper, An Phoblacht, Mr Kearney said: "It's increasingly obvious the DUP have lost the run of themselves within the northern political institutions." He repeated an earlier call by his party colleague Martin McGuinness that Mrs Foster should step aside as first minister to "allow a time-framed, comprehensive, independent investigation" into the heating scheme. The DUP leader set up the RHI scheme in 2012 when she was minister for enterprise, trade and investment. Last month she apologised for its lack of cost controls but defended her own role in the scheme. Sinn Féin and the DUP lead a power-sharing coalition government at Stormont, with the support of Justice Minister Claire Sugden, an independent MLA. However, relationships have been under increased strain as the full implications for the public purse of the botched RHI scheme have been revealed. Mr Kearney's article also criticised the DUP and its Communities Minister Paul Givan for last week's decision to withdraw funding for an Irish language bursary scheme. The Líofa (fluent) Gaeltacht bursary scheme enabled at least 100 people a year to attend summer Irish language classes in the Donegal gaeltacht. The funding cut was announced by Mr Givan's department two days before Christmas. Mr Kearney wrote: "The political process has now been dragged recklessly by the DUP, culminating with the RHI crisis towards an unprecedented tipping point. "Political institutions cease to have value when they do not reflect equality, mutual respect and parity of esteem, and have become detached from the lives of citizens they are meant to serve. "Playing fast and loose with the political process and the political institutions is unsustainable. "There are big decisions to make, and there is very little time." However, Sinn Féin was criticised by the SDLP for not supporting its call for a public inquiry into the RHI scandal. SDLP MLA Patsy McGlone said: "Surrendering the demand for a judge-led public inquiry is surrendering the need for transparency, accountability and consequences for the loss of hundreds of millions in public money. "With trust in our hard-won institutions at stake, Sinn Féin need to think very carefully on where their loyalties lie. The SDLP have been clear, only a judge-led inquiry can get to the truth of this matter."	Sinn Féin has accused the DUP of dragging the political process "towards an unprecedented tipping point" over the 'cash-for-ash' scandal.
Norman Rimmington, also known as "Rimmo", signed with Barnsley in 1945, earning £3 a week as a goalkeeper. He worked for the football club in many roles after he hung up his gloves, including coach, assistant manager, groundsman, physio and kit man. Fans of the club applauded as the funeral procession passed the Tykes' Oakwell stadium. Mr Rimmington, who was born in Staincross, was described by the club as a "fearless" keeper who made 27 appearances for the side, before moving to Hartlepool United in 1947. The goalkeeper, who also worked as a pit fitter and a mechanic, returned to the South Yorkshire side in 1952 and never left. He died in late December aged 93. Family members, friends, colleagues and former team-mates attended a service at All Saints Church, Darton, followed by a ceremony at Barnsley Crematorium. In an interview with BBC Sport, Mr Rimmington said he "used to get some stick as a goalkeeper" during his playing days. "They could knock you into back of net and it were a goal; it's not the same game," he said. "Now they go down as if they've been shot and there's nothing wrong with them." Shortly before his death, he was informed he had been awarded the British Empire Medal for services to football. Discussing his deep connection with the club, he said: "I were born in Barnsley, brought up in Barnsley and played at Barnsley. "I love the club and everything I've done here." In a statement, the club said: "Rimmo was a true club legend and a man who represented the club with the upmost pride and dedication throughout his life." •Born: 29 Nov 1923, Staincross, near Barnsley •Occupations outside football: Pit fitter and mechanic •1946-47: Barnsley FC (27 appearances) •1947-52: Hartlepool Utd (127 appearances) •1952-61: Barnsley 'A' team coach •1961-1972: Head coach and physio •1972-1978: Groundsman and physio •1978-1980: Assistant manager and physio •1980-1985: Physio •1985-2016: Kitman and laundry	The funeral of a "club legend" who worked for Barnsley FC for more than 65 years has been held.
Spurs chairman Daniel Levy this week defended a lack of signings and railed against "unsustainable" spending. They were runners up to Chelsea in the Premier League last term, faltered in the Champions League group stages, and again in the Europa League last 32. "If [Spurs] don't win the title, it's not a tragedy," said Conte. "If they don't arrive in the Champions League, it's not a tragedy. If they go out in the first round of the Champions League, it's not a tragedy. If they go out after the first game that they play in the Europa League, it's not a tragedy. "Maybe for Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and - I don't know - Liverpool, it is a tragedy. You must understand the status of the team. "Every team has to understand what their ambitions are. If their ambitions are to fight for the title or win the Champions League, you must buy expensive players. Otherwise you continue to stay in your level. It's simple." "My question is this: What are Tottenham's expectations?" After finishing second in the Premier League last season, Spurs have not added to their squad over the summer. Their only transfer activity has been selling England right-back Kyle Walker to rivals Manchester City for £45m. "We have a duty to manage the club appropriately," Levy said. Recent history suggests it may be a while before Levy makes his move, with the majority of Spurs' incoming deals finalised in August in the past few seasons. Last August, they paid Newcastle £30m for midfielder Moussa Sissoko in the final few hours of the window, having signed £9m winger Georges-Kevin Nkoudou and loan goalkeeper Pau Lopez earlier in the day. In previous seasons, forward Son Heung-min (£22m), midfielder Erik Lamela (£25.7m), goalkeeper Hugo Lloris (£11.8m) and forward Clint Dempsey (£6m) all joined the club in the closing days and hours of transfer windows. More than £850m has been spent by Premier League sides so far in the summer transfer window, which closes on 31 August, with accountancy firm Deloitte predicting top-flight clubs will surpass the record £1.165bn they spent last summer. Chelsea have parted with about £130m for three players - forward Alvaro Morata from Real Madrid, midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko from Monaco and defender Antonio Rudiger from Roma. Conte revealed Chelsea "tried to buy" Walker and acknowledged that the market is currently "very difficult", adding: "I think now every single player is expensive." Conte also said Spurs and England striker Harry Kane would be his first pick if he could sign any forward. Kane has finished as the Premier League's top goalscorer for the past two seasons. "Tottenham is a really good squad if they are able to keep all the players," Conte said. "For me, Kane, now, is one of the best strikers in the world. "If I had to buy one striker I would go to Kane. He is a complete striker. He is strong physically, with the ball, without the ball, he fights and he's strong in the air and acrobatic on the right and the left. "If you go to buy Kane now it would be at least £100m."	Chelsea manager Antonio Conte has questioned Tottenham's ambition, suggesting they have lower expectations than their Premier League title rivals.
The 19-year-old has been with the Shakers since 2013 and scored two goals in 14 appearances last season. However, he can return to Gigg Lane if Bury use the recall clause in his contract, which expires on 28 April. He has had previous loan spells with National League North side Stalybridge Celtic and Norway's Bergsoy IL.	Macclesfield Town have signed midfielder Scott Burgess on a season-long loan deal from League One club Bury.
Waites thrashed Jeff Smith 7-1 in Sunday's final at Lakeside. The 38-year-old from Huddersfield had an operation on a rotator cuff problem in February. "I had six weeks without throwing a dart - that's painful in itself. Now I'm taking the world title back home," he told BBC Sport. "It's hard trying to come back from an injury and trying to get yourself to practice. Sometimes, no matter what you do, your body won't react with it." Waites, who added to his previous Lakeside success from 2013, continued: "This week, I've prepared myself to play for two hours in a session and it's so difficult to do. My shoulder and my body wasn't happy with that. "After I played Glen Durrant [in the quarter-finals on Friday] I ended up going to sleep at half past eight." Media playback is not supported on this device Waites, who was the ninth seed, is the eighth man to win the BDO title on more than one occasion. He raced into a 5-0 lead in the final against unseeded Canadian Smith, 40, and eventually wrapped up a comfortable victory. "It's not really sunk in yet," said Waites, who will return to his job as a carpenter on Tuesday. "I can't believe it was over so quickly. I set myself up for it being a really tough game and Jeff, although he pushed me a little bit, didn't take his opportunities. "I took my opportunities when I got them and I was taking sets."	Scott Waites was delighted to clinch a second BDO world title, admitting it seemed "a million miles away" following shoulder surgery last year.
Donald Trump, Jeb Bush and Scott Walker will take the stage in Cleveland on Thursday night with seven rivals. Fox News selected the 10 most popular Republicans based on five national polls, excluding Mr Perry and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. Those two and five other candidates will take part in an earlier debate. Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum reacted angrily to his omission. "The idea that they have left out the runner-up for the 2012 nomination [Santorum], the former four-term governor of Texas [Perry], the governor of Louisiana [Bobby Jindal], the first female Fortune 50 CEO [Carly Fiorina], and the 3-term Senator from South Carolina [Graham] due to polling seven months before a single vote is cast is preposterous," his spokesman said. In contrast, Mr Perry tweeted that he was looking forward to being on Fox at 5pm for "a serious exchange of ideas and positive solutions to get America back on track". The main debate takes place four hours later at 9pm local time (01:00 GMT). All eyes will be on hotel tycoon Mr Trump, who leads the polls and has made headlines with outspoken remarks about many of his rivals. A fun guide to the 10 Republican debaters One of the Republican frontrunners, Jeb Bush, became embroiled in a row with leading Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton over women's health funding on Tuesday. The former Florida governor was attacked by Mrs Clinton after he told a conservative Christian audience he wasn't sure "we need half a billion dollars for women's health issues". But he later said he "misspoke" after criticism of his remarks.

Latest figures show the the nursing and midwifery vacancy rate stands at 4.5% - the highest ever reported. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said the current situation with unfilled posts threatened patient care. Health Secretary Shona Robison insisted staff levels within the NHS had risen to "historically high levels" under the SNP. Figures from ISD Scotland show 2,818.9 whole-time equivalent (WTE) posts were unfilled at the end of March, a 27.5% increase from March last year. The number of such posts lying unfilled for three months or more was up 51.3% year on year to 670.6. During the same period, the NHS spent Â£8.4m more on nursing and midwifery bank and agency staff, paying out a total of Â£166.5m. Vacancies for consultants have also risen year on year from 6.5% to 7.4% and there were 415.7 vacancies, of which 203.4 have lain empty for more than three months, up 38.2 from 2016. The total number of staff working within the Scottish NHS, however, has risen 0.7% year on year to 139,430 WTE posts. Norman Provan of the RCN warned: "If there aren't the nurses, patients won't receive the care they need." He added: "These figures reflect the challenge faced by Scotland's NHS. Across both acute and community settings, there are simply too few nurses. "The Scottish government can point to the increase in the number of nursing and midwifery staff, but the reality on the ground is that nurses wanting to do their very best for patients are too often coming up against the reality of vacancies in the workforce. "Nursing morale is low and teams are struggling to recruit and retain the staff they need." Health Secretary Ms Robison said part of the increase in vacancies was due to the creation of new posts in health boards. She said: "Under this government, NHS staff numbers have risen to historically high levels, with more doctors and nursing staff now delivering care for the people of Scotland - including over 2,000 additional qualified nurses and midwives. "We're committed to training and retaining our nursing staff, and earlier this year we confirmed a 4.7% increase in trainee nurses and midwives for 2017/18 - a fifth successive rise. "We have also committed Â£450,000 over three years to reintroduce a national return to practice scheme."	Nursing leaders are warning the NHS in Scotland has "too few nurses" after vacancies rose to record levels.
Ministers and other government officials are being given a three-month deadline to hand over state-owned homes and vehicles, from the date of the new president's inauguration. The law targets presidential appointees who try to cling on to the perks of office after a new leader is elected. Ghana goes to the polls on 7 December. After previous transfers of power, some officials have had to be forcibly evicted and had their state-owned vehicles seized after failing to hand them back. The law does not apply to presidents and vice-presidents as we earlier reported. The bill, which was passed by MPs on Wednesday evening, will now go to the president to sign into law. Existing legislation requires officials to hand back government property after they leave office, but this is the first time a strict time limit has been applied. Ghana's current leader John Mahama is standing for re-election and his main opponent is Nana Akufo-Addo. The winner will be inaugurated on 7 January 2017. Ghana's presidential candidates:	Outgoing ministers in Ghana could be forcibly evicted from their official residences if they fail to move out in time, under new laws.
Almost completely cut off for centuries, it has tried to let in some aspects of the outside world while fiercely guarding its ancient traditions. The Bhutanese name for Bhutan, Druk Yul, means "Land of the Thunder Dragon" and it only began to open up to outsiders in the 1970s. The Wangchuck hereditary monarchy has wielded power since 1907. But Bhutan became a two-party parliamentary democracy after elections in March 2008. Population 750,000 Area 38,364 sq km (14,812 sq miles) Major language Dzongkha Major religions Buddhism (official), Hinduism Life expectancy 66 years (men), 70 years (women) Currency ngultrum Head of state: King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck succeeded his father, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, in December 2006 after the former monarch announced his abdication. His predecessor had already given up some of his absolute powers in 1998 and ruled in conjunction with the government, an assembly and a royal advisory council. Prime Minister: Tshering Tobgay Tshering Tobgay was elected Bhutan's second prime minister in July 2013, succeeding Jigme Yozer Thinley. He is president of the People's Democratic Party. He was leader of the opposition in the National Assembly from March 2008 to April 2013. He has projected himself as a reformer, rejecting official limousine and prime ministerial accommodation. Television did not come to Bhutan until 1999. For years, the country cut itself off, fearing that outside influences would undermine its monarchy and culture. Radio broadcasting began in 1973 and the internet arrived in 1999. Some key dates in the history of Bhutan: 1720 - Chinese imperial army invades and temporarily establishes control over Bhutan. 1772-73 - British intervention. 1864-65 - Further intervention by Britain. 1907 - Ugyen Wangchuck is chosen as hereditary ruler. 1910 - Treaty giving Britain control over foreign relations. 1949 - Treaty signed with newly-independent India guaranteeing non-interference in Bhutan's internal affairs, but allowing Delhi influence over foreign relations. 1958 - Slavery abolished. 1974 - First foreign tourists allowed in. 1990 - Thousands of Hindus flee to Nepal following clashes. 1998 - King cedes some powers to national assembly.	Bhutan is a tiny and remote kingdom nestling in the Himalayas between its powerful neighbours, India and China.
Redknapp has added goalkeeper David Stockdale, defender Marc Roberts and midfielder Cheikh N'Doye this summer. Ravel Morrison and Simeon Slavchev also remain on trial with the club, but the Blues manager wants more additions before the season begins on Saturday. "We're a little bit short at the moment - we need to improve the squad this week if we can," he told BBC WM. "We've been trying, but it's been very difficult to get the players in who we've been chasing. Hopefully we'll get there - it's not been through lack of effort." Redknapp confirmed an interest in Bristol City's Aden Flint, who may be available following the arrival of Nathan Baker from Aston Villa. "I like him but we'll only pay what we can - if he's too expensive then we'll move on," he said. Following the 2-0 friendly loss to Swansea on Saturday, Redknapp also said defender Ryan Shotton could leave if the club's valuation is met. If Shotton were to go that would leave Birmingham, who missed out on John Terry to rivals Villa, with just two centre-backs going into the opening game of the Championship season at Ipswich on Saturday. "I'm not frustrated. I'm just desperate to do well, but I need the tools to be able to do that," Redknapp said. "If I get the tools I'll do that, if I don't then it's going to be difficult."	Birmingham City will face a "difficult" season if they cannot sign new players this week, says manager Harry Redknapp.
Sixth seed Wozniacki, the champion in 2010, saw off unseeded American Stephens 6-2 6-3 in the first semi-final in Toronto. Defending champion Simona Halep was thrashed 6-1 6-1 by Ukraine's Elina Svitolina in the second semi-final. The pair played twice in the day after rain disrupted the schedule. Svitolina lost the first set against Wimbledon champion Garbine Muguruza before the rain arrived on Friday night, and the fifth seed fought back on Saturday to win 4-6 6-4 6-3. Romanian second seed Halep swept past France's Caroline Garcia 6-4 6-2 in the last of the quarter-finals. None of Wozniacki's 25 career titles have been won this year - losing all five finals she has played in 2017. "I had one year where I went to six finals and I won all of them," she said. "I guess it's a give and take sometimes and just that I keep myself in these situations is awesome." Svitolina said she was "a little bit tired" after the rain affected her schedule, but is ready for the final. "I didn't expect this type of day but I'm very happy that I could stay very focused," she said. "Yeah, I'm very happy."	Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki will try to win her first title of 2017 after reaching her sixth final with victory over Sloane Stephens at the Rogers Cup.
President Juan Manuel Santos said the authorities do not know how many people are still missing. Heavy rains caused the river Liboriana, in the town of Salgar, to burst its banks, triggering the landslide. Much of the village of Santa Margarita, south-west of the provincial capital, Medellin, was swept away when the disaster hit early on Monday. Rescue teams and residents have got together to dig through rouble in the hope of finding survivors. After visiting the scene of the disaster, Mr Santos declared a state of emergency and promised to rebuild the houses. "We cannot bring the dead back, which we regret deeply, and we will support the families (of the victims)," said Mr Santos earlier. "But we have to move on from this tragedy, and look ahead with courage and fortitude." "The priority now is the hospital," said the president. Earlier on Monday, gas and electricity services in the town were suspended as a precautionary measure. The Colombian Air Force and police have sent helicopters to the area. More than 160 soldiers are working in the emergency effort. Some 100 people have been evacuated from high-risk areas. Local official Zulma Osorio spoke of a "tragedy of enormous proportions". Mud, rocks and tree trunks destroyed many houses in poor neighbourhoods close to the river. Resident Jorge Quintero described his ordeal when the landslide hit the village: "When I felt my house shaking we got out, my family and me. When we got out, we were stuck in the middle of the landslide, it was coming from both sides and we were in the middle. "I said to my wife, let's hold each other and hope that God saves us and I know he gave us his hand because here we are, alive, still frightened, but still alive." More rain is expected in the are in the next few days.	More than 50 people have been killed in a landslide in Antioquia province in north-west Colombia, officials say.
The Team Dimension Data rider, 33, timed his push perfectly on the final climbs of the 194.5km stage from Bradford to Fox Valley near Sheffield. Pauwels' team-mate Omar Fraile finished second and Britain's Tao Geoghegan-Hart, riding for Team Sky, was fifth. Nacer Bouhanni, Saturday's stage winner, was taken to hospital after being knocked unconscious in a crash. Pauwels attacked at the top of the Cote de Wigtwizzle, with 22km remaining, then eked out a 30-second lead on the Cote de Ewden Height. The chasing pack narrowed that advantage to nine seconds by the summit of the final climb out of Midhopestones but Pauwels eased clear again to claim victory. "It feels a bit strange," Pauwels said. "It is the first time I have had my hands in the air. "But I think people would not really be surprised that I take a win because I have been quite close. "Last year I was second, third, fourth, everything except a win, and now I get two wins at the same time which makes it more special." Men's Tour de Yorkshire, stage three result: 1.

Media playback is not supported on this device Ulster twice opened a seven-point lead through tries by wing Craig Gilroy and full-back Jared Payne. In a week when the Welsh Rugby Union announced they intend to take over the region, Dragons hit back with scores by Rynard Landman and Ollie Griffiths. Paddy Jackson's kick edged Ulster ahead before Rodney Ah You was shown a red card and Andrew claimed the key try. Ah You was dismissed after he was adjudged to have made an illegal shoulder charge on Dragons full-back Carl Meyer. The win means Ulster stay fourth in the Pro12 table, but their failure to gain a bonus point means fifth-placed Scarlets have reduced their cushion to three points with four matches remaining. Playing for the last time this season at Rodney Parade, Dragons were dominated in the early stages and were seven points down within 10 minutes thanks to Ruan Pienaar's vision and Gilroy's footwork. The South African scrum half's kick into space bounced horribly for the defenders and Gilroy dribbled the ball into space and touched down near the posts. The Welsh region dominated possession for the rest of the half, at one stage going through 32-phases, but never really looking likely to score a try. O'Brien's penalty was cancelled out by Pienaar with Carl Meyer' long-range penalty off target to leave Ulster with a seven-point half-time lead. A debatable yellow card for Gilroy gave the Dragons a bridgehead which Landman turned into points with a rumbling lineout drive. O'Brien's conversion levelled the scores. But before the Ulster wing had returned to the field of play full-back Payne cut a clever line to cross for his side's second try. Dragons, in 10th-place in the table, again hit back with flanker Griffiths charging down a clearance and being given the benefit of considerable double and awarded the try after several TV replays. Jackson's penalty with eight minutes remaining edged Ulster back ahead before Ah You' careless challenge reduced his team to 14-men with six minutes remaining. Ulster rallied and kicked for the corner with Andrew claiming the crucial try from the driving lineout.

Alice Pyne, 17, of Ulverston, died of Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2013 after publishing her wish list. Haley McTaggart, 33, admitted getting her charity Alice's Escapes to pay Â£2,000 for her to go on a trek to Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. McTaggart admitted fraud and was jailed for 10 months suspended for two years. The court also heard how McTaggart sold raffle tickets for a false raffle and never handed over the money. She also told the charity that she was unable to transfer money after the trip to Tanzania. Sentencing McTaggart, Recorder John Corless said she had committed an "unpleasant and serious" offence. Alice's Escapes was founded in 2012 by Miss Payne who 16 at the time. The teenager wanted to provide holidays in Cumbria for seriously ill children and their families. The top item on her bucket list was the hope that everyone in the UK would sign up as a bone marrow donor, an aspiration which Prime Minister David Cameron praised in the House of Commons. It is estimated that about 40,000 people signed up as donors as a direct result of her appeal. Miss Pyne and her sister Milly raised more than Â£100,000.	A Whitehaven woman who defrauded a charity set up by a teenager dying of cancer who became well-known for her "bucket list" has been sentenced.
After going down to 12 men, following Ben Flower's red card, Wigan scored 21 unanswered points to triumph. The Warriors have lost the past two Super League deciders at Old Trafford. "We will take a lot of confidence coming into the back end of the year when confidence is important going into big games," Smith said. Victory when the Catalans Dragons visit the DW Stadium next week would guarantee Wigan a home semi-final, while their hopes of clinching the League Leaders' Shield are slim as Warrington travel to second-placed Hull FC. Warrington only need a draw to win the first piece of Super League silverware this season. "We are looking just to win the game next week. Whatever comes of it, being first or second, gets us a home semi and that is what we want," Smith told BBC Radio Manchester. "We want to get to Old Trafford and want to win. We've had a disappointing couple of years, and it is all about progressing now and putting in a performance next week." If Wigan do reach the final for a fourth successive season, they may be without Flower after his elbow on Declan Patton saw him sent off with 23 minutes remaining on Friday. It was the prop's first dismissal since receiving an early red card in Wigan's Grand Final defeat by St Helens in 2014. A man down and with the League Leaders' Shield being made ready for presentation to Wolves, the visitors produced a remarkable turnaround from 28-14 down in the second half. Josh Charnley touched town twice and Lewis Tierney completed a brace of his own before Smith edged Wigan ahead with a drop goal. Anthony Gelling's late try put the result beyond doubt. "As soon as we got the first try when Benny got sent off I think the belief was there to go on and do something special," Smith said. "When you come to stadiums like this and get results like that, it gives you a massive lift."	Wigan have the confidence to go on and win the Super League Grand Final after overcoming leaders Warrington on Friday, says half-back Matty Smith.
Hassan Nasrallah said Syria's opposition was too weak to bring down Bashar al-Assad's regime militarily. He was speaking in an address broadcast on Hezbollah's TV station al-Manar. BBC Arab affairs analyst Sebastian Usher says the speech tacitly confirmed the group has been involved in fighting in neighbouring Syria. The Syrian opposition has long claimed the Iranian-backed Shia movement has been supplying fighters to help Mr Assad, a key Hezbollah backer. "A large number [of rebels] were preparing to capture villages inhabited by Lebanese... so it was normal to offer every possible and necessary aid to help the Syrian army,"  Mr Nasrallah was quoted as saying by AFP news agency. The Hezbollah leader said it had never hidden its martyrs, but that reports that large numbers of its fighters had been killed were lies. He also warned that if a key Shia shrine south of Damascus - that named after Sayida Zeinab, a granddaughter of Prophet Muhammad - were to be destroyed, it would spark revenge that could get out of control. "If the shrine is destroyed things will get out of control," he said. Mr Nasrallah tried to reassure his domestic audience that - above all - Hezbollah wanted to avoid the Syrian war coming to Lebanon, adds our correspondent, but many there may find little to comfort them in this latest show of defiance. The announcement came hours after 14 people were killed by a powerful explosion in Damascus, and a day after Syrian Prime Minister Wael al-Halqi survived a car bomb attack in the Syrian capital. Government forces and rebels have been fighting in and around Damascus for months, but neither have gained the upper hand. More than 70,000 people have been killed since fighting between Syrian forces and rebels erupted in March 2011.	The head of Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has declared that Syria has real friends who will not let it fall to the US, Israel or Islamic radicals.
The former UKIP leader will provide political analysis for the main channel, and the Fox Business Network's daytime and primetime programmes. Mr Farage has been one of the UK's most prominent supporters of US President Donald Trump and appeared alongside him during his election campaign. He was the first UK politician to meet Mr Trump after his win in November. It comes shortly after he was given his own nightly show on UK radio station LBC. Mr Farage travelled to Washington for Mr Trump's inauguration on Friday. After the ceremony he tweeted his approval saying: "A very strong speech by @POTUS. He means it." He also appeared on Fox Business to comment on the inauguration. He said: "Listening to the speech today, this is a political revolution and it's very exciting." Mr Farage has said he wants to be a "bridge" between the UK and Donald Trump's US administration. The US president tweeted in November that Mr Farage would make a good British ambassador to the US but Downing Street rejected the suggestion, saying there was "no vacancy".	Nigel Farage has been hired as a commentator for American TV network Fox News, the broadcaster has announced.
The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said mosques would offer refreshments and "insight" into how they run. Leaders from other religions have also been invited, to "demonstrate unity". The MCB has raised concerns about anti-Muslim sentiment since 17 people were killed by Islamist militants in Paris last month. Announcing Visit My Mosque Day, the MCB said: "Mosques will be sharing tea and refreshments alongside an insight into the day-to-day goings on of a busy Muslim centre of worship. Members of the Muslim community "may be on hand to answer questions about Muslims and Islam where this is possible," it said. "Local mosques will also be inviting inter-faith leaders as well, and all will be invited to come together to demonstrate unity and solidarity during what has been a tense time for faith communities." Speaking outside the East London Mosque in Whitechapel, MCB assistant secretary general Miqdaad Versi said the organisation wanted to "de-mystify what Islam, Muslims and mosques are all about". "People can have the opportunity to understand these things directly from people that they can speak to, and by actually experiencing these institutions and coming into mosques they can break down the barriers that they previously had," he said. Mr Versi said there had been a rise in "Islamophobia" since the Paris killings, with attacks on three or four mosques, more verbal attacks against Muslims and "a lot more hate mail" being received by the MCB. "For us it's important to try and create a positive image, and not let the actions of a few impact the reality of the many," he added. The Reverend Fred Ashford-Okai, one of those who visited East London Mosque earlier, said: "The more we know about each other - Muslims, Christians, Jews, even those with no faith - the more we can actually live a more cohesive life in our community." More than 20 mosques were expected to take part. The figure is a small proportion of the total number of mosques in Britain, which is estimated to be 1,750. The MCB said only 55-60% of mosques were affiliated to it, and the total includes small establishments such as prayer rooms in schools and offices.	Mosques have opened their doors to the public as part of a drive to "reach out to fellow Britons following tensions around terrorism".
Thousands of animals, many of them endangered, are part of the count which is required by law as part of the zoo's licence. Important details about each and every individual are noted down so that the zoo can help worldwide breeding programmes. Newsround's Martin headed to the zoo, which houses over 400 different species, to find out how it's done.	Keepers at Chester Zoo are making sure every creature, from the biggest elephant to the smallest beetle, is present and correct as part of their annual animal count.
At least 100 others were wounded in the strike, which reportedly struck a warehouse containing weapons. The commando unit is allied with Houthi rebels whose military capabilities the coalition has been trying to destroy. Casualties were also reported after air strikes in the northern province of Hajjah, near the Saudi border. Residents of the Bakeel al-Meer area told the Reuters news agency that at least 40 people had been killed, mostly civilians. "Houthi gunmen were attacking Saudi border positions from this area but the coalition's planes failed to hit the fighters and bombed civilians [instead]," one resident alleged. Hours after the air strikes in Hajjah, coalition warplanes targeted the headquarters of the Special Security Forces in the southern Sabaain district of Sanaa. Officials from the rebel-controlled health ministry said that 36 soldiers and officers had been killed. However, a commando who survived the attack suggested that civilians might also have been among the victims. "There were many people at the entrance to the warehouse, getting their weapons, farmers, cooks [and also soldiers]; these poor people were standing at the entrance to the warehouse," he told Reuters. Other air strikes on Wednesday severely damaged a rebel-controlled naval base in the western province of Hudaydah, on Yemen's Red Sea coast. A rebel-held military base outside Dhalea was also hit, a day after militiamen allied to the exiled government were reported to have taken control of the southern city. The World Health Organization's director general, Dr Margaret Chan, said on Wednesday that two months of air strikes and fighting on the ground had left up to 2,000 people dead and 8,000 wounded, including hundreds of women and children. Almost 7.5 million people are in urgent need of medical help. "Hospitals around the country are closing down their emergency operations rooms and intensive care units due to shortages in staff and fuel for generators," Dr Chan warned. "The health and lives of millions of people are at risk." The UN has been trying to reschedule peace talks in Geneva that were planned for this week, but the government has insisted the Houthis recognise its authority, withdraw from cities they control and disarm before being allowed to participate.	Saudi-led coalition warplanes have bombed a special forces camp in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, killing at least 36 people, officials and witnesses say.
Surrey County Council leader David Hodge said the government had cut its annual grant by £170m since 2010. The proposed increase would add nearly £200 to a Band D bill, bringing it to about £1,500. The government said if the proposed budget is set, taxpayers would have the final say in a referendum. Any authority wanting to increase council tax by more than 2% must put the plans to a vote. This would take place on 4 May, alongside local elections, and would include a vote in Chancellor Philip Hammond's constituency of Runnymede and Weybridge. Opposition councillors in Surrey said the increase would be unaffordable for many residents and it followed financial failings by the council and the government's failure to fund services properly. Council tax analysis - Pete Sherlock, BBC News data journalist We can't say what the average rises are set to be this year, as not all local authorities have declared their intentions. However, last year the average Band D council tax set by local authorities in England for 2016-17 was £1,530. This was an increase of £46 - or 3.1% on the 2015-16 figure of £1,484 -  and 1.6% of that was the adult social care precept. So Surrey's rise is five times last year's average. This shows how council tax hikes were brought down post 2008, but are now on the rise again. Mr Hodge said the council had to set a budget for 2017-18 that would protect vital services. He said: "The government has cut our annual grant by £170m since 2010, leaving a huge gap in our budget. "Demand for adult social care, learning disabilities and children's services is increasing every year. "So I regret, despite us finding £450m worth of savings from our annual budget, we have no choice but to propose this increase in council tax." Liberal Democrat leader Hazel Watson said a 15% rise would hit the elderly and those on fixed incomes hardest. She said: "It is astonishing that the Conservative administration think Surrey residents should carry the can for their own financial failings and the government's failure to properly fund services." The Conservative council had failed in its negotiations with the government, even though three cabinet ministers were Surrey MPs, she added. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt are MPs in the county along with Philip Hammond. A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: "If the council sets this proposed budget, then the taxpayers of Surrey will have the final say in a referendum in May. We should trust the people. "Our long-term funding settlement means more spending power for Surrey County Council during this parliament, with £3.2 billion to deliver the services that local people want." Analysis: Jack Fiehn, BBC Surrey political reporter For years, senior councillors have spoken out about cuts to the authority's central grant and the impact on adult social care and children's services, as well as school places and road maintenance. There has been huge frustration and we seem to have reached a crunch point. Surrey residents are used to council tax rises. They have gone up every year since 2012 - but never by such a large amount. This will be a test of public support. The Liberal Democrats, Labour and the Green Party all oppose a referendum, but David Hodge has told me he has the support of his fellow Conservatives. So unless something significant happens, it is almost certain to go ahead. He has also denied reports there will be a deal with ministers to abandon the vote, putting the government on course for a row with a council in the Tory heartland. Former care minister and Liberal Democrat health spokesman Norman Lamb said Surrey's decision would be a test for local authorities, which were seeing increasing numbers of older people and younger people not getting the care and support they need. Shadow local government secretary Teresa Pearce said: "Forcing councils to rely on council tax income to fund statutory services, such as social care, is simply unsustainable and unrealistic."	A Conservative-run council wants to raise its tax by 15% in the next financial year, blaming government cuts and increased demand for social care.
Operation Anagram was formed by Strathclyde Police in 2006 after Tobin raped and murdered 23-year-old Polish student Angelika Kluk in Glasgow. It also helped convict him of the murders of 18-year-old Dinah McNicol and 15-year-old Vicky Hamilton. Police said that while the operation was being scaled back it would never end. Det Sup David Swindle, who formed the operation, said anyone with information regarding Peter Tobin would still be able to contact the Anagram incident room via e-mail which would be monitored daily. "Since Operation Anagram was formed in 2006, I could never have believed the momentum and magnitude it would have developed into," he said. "The public response and assistance from the media has been unbelievable. "The long-running investigation has brought some solace to the families of Vicky Hamilton and Dinah McNicol in knowing what happened to their loved ones." Det Sup Swindle said that although Anagram had not uncovered other murder victims of Tobin to date, he was "proud" of its "success in bringing closure" to some bereaved families. He added: "I leave Strathclyde Police after 34 years in the knowledge that we have tried our best to find out the truth of what Tobin has done and also with confidence that the Anagram processes built up over the last four and a half years ensures a life long awareness of this cowardly, vicious serial killer Tobin. "Any new information coming to light will continue to be researched which may bring similar closure to other families. "The search for the truth about what Peter Tobin has done will continue." Tobin is serving three life sentences for the murders of Vicky Hamilton, Dinah McNicol and Angelika Kluk. Ms Kluk was raped and murdered at a church in Glasgow in 2006. The bodies of Ms McNicol, from Essex, and Ms Hamilton, from Redding in Falkirk, were found the following year in the garden of Tobin's former home in Margate, Kent. Operation Anagram has helped piece together a timeline of Tobin's movements and relationships over decades in a bid to determine whether he is responsible for other unsolved crimes.	A dedicated police operation set up to examine the activities of serial killer Peter Tobin is to be wound down.
The first incident saw a 71-year-old woman from Sandyhills tricked by someone claiming to work for BT. Now a woman in Stranraer has lost money to a caller who said he was contacting her about problems with her internet. He claimed to be from BT technical support and gained remote access to her computer to take the cash. The Sandyhills incident happened on 15 September with the Stranraer con taking place seven days later. PC Siobhan Pellett said: "The ease with which these people seem to be able to gain access to their victim's computer is frightening and the sums of money being taken are substantial. "We are asking people to be very, very careful when answering a cold call from someone who tries to gain remote access to their computer in order to rectify an alleged fault. "Our message is worth repeating once again that people should never, never give out any banking details or account numbers over the telephone. "Banks, building societies and reputable businesses never ask for this information."	A 60-year-old woman in Dumfries and Galloway has been conned out of £30,000 just a week after a similar scam netted £10,000.
Media playback is not supported on this device The two heavyweights fight for the IBF title and vacant WBA belt in front of 90,000 fans at Wembley. Joshua, 27, says his 13 weeks of preparation have been "tougher times than I have had in any walk of life". Klitschko, 41, lost his heavyweight title to Tyson Fury in November 2015 - his first defeat in 11 years. In an interview at his Sheffield training camp before the biggest fight of his career, Joshua spoke about his motivation, being a "man of the people", the state of British boxing, and his family. Joshua, unbeaten in 18 fights since turning professional in 2013, said he is not worried about his safety in the ring because of the intensity of his training before the fight. "I've been pushed to places I've never been pushed before," said the Briton. "I think I take more punishment in the gym than I do in the fights. Sometimes I try things and it doesn't work and I've broken my ribs, my hand, dislocated shoulders in the gym but we get it right for the fight. "One of the main things is his mindset at the minute. He claims he is obsessed and I ask 'What is he obsessed about?' I look at myself in the mirror and it is about beating me. "I've lived simple. I've been training under the dark light so I can shine under the bright lights on April 29." Joshua had numerous incidents with the police as a youth, including being arrested for ABH, drug possession and being electronically tagged. He has previously stated that he would have been in jail were it not for boxing. But Joshua said: "I've had tougher times in the gym than I have had in any walk of life at the minute. "I put myself through it and it is important to because I don't want to be star of the gym and then when I get to the fight it's like: 'I've never faced this type of warrior before.'" Asked if this is the defining fight of his career, Joshua replied: "It is one of them. If this was towards the end of my career, I would say: 'This is the defining fight that's going to write the history books.' "But I've still got so many more years. I'm confident. I'm learning about myself, so this fight is, for me, one fight that I've got to take in my stride round by round and when I take that attitude the victory comes and we move on and there are so many other big fights in the UK." Joshua does not believe Klitschko has underestimated him, saying: "He's coming game, he's coming ready, and the body does what the mind tells it. His mind seems to be in the right place so I'm in for a tough fight." "I may not express myself flashing what I've done and telling everyone I'm the greatest," he said. "Where we grew up, everyone was about making money, but low key, understated - you probably didn't want to get your house burgled! "Who I am when I was 17 is who I am today, so not much has changed. "You've got to add a bit of flavour. It's needed now and again, but it's got to be real because I don't take boxing as an act. This is way of expressing myself and being true to myself and there are kids watching so you've got to be mindful. "If I was to be that type of person - loud and trashing tables - after a fight, I would still continue to be that way. What I notice about fighters is they act a certain way and once the fight has started they are hugging each other and are quiet. "I'm just trying to be myself on camera, in the ring, outside of the ring and off camera." Media playback is not supported on this device Asked about being very accessible, Joshua says: "It's part of boxing. It is good to lock yourself away but I'm a man of the people, it's no bother. As long as it doesn't make me late for training, I've no problem speaking to 100 people. "I'm in the same flat that I've been in since 2011 - it's been a long time. I think I'll be one of those guys who will learn the piano, the violin, bungee jump and do all the things I didn't do when I was fighting. "When I'm not fighting, I try to take a holiday and experience things, but when I'm fighting the simple life has worked and I don't try and change it." "I was on the complete opposite end of healthy living before boxing, it's got me strong," he said. "I'm a superhero to my little cousins. It's what it does for my family and my surname Joshua. "People are proud to wear that name and I'm representing my family. It is nice to have kids supporting you. It's reaching out to a wider audience. "I'm just a normal person. You have your good days, your bad days, you have road rage, everyone goes through it. "You've just got to live by the job you do and if that's what comes with it I'd rather choose winning over anything." Joshua, who turned professional after winning gold at London 2012, said: "When I first turned professional, no-one would touch me sponsorship-wise and no-one was really backing boxing. "I say look at the characters of the sport, look at the individuals, get behind the gloves." He praised fellow Brits Tyson Fury, who won the heavyweight title with a win over Klitschko in November 2015, Dillian Whyte, the WBC International heavyweight title holder, former British and Commonwealth heavyweight title holder David Price and Dereck Chisora, who challenged for the WBC heavyweight title in 2012. "As I've been in the game, Fury won, Dillian, myself, Chisora the likes of Price, up-and-coming heavyweights and lighter weights - it's definitely brought more attention." Asked if he was worried about his mum watching his fights, Joshua answers: "No, no, no, definitely not. Because she's proud, she's happy and I look after her so I think that's the main thing. "I've got a son and I definitely wouldn't want him to fight because of those reasons, his health, it's tough. "I did it quietly. When I first started fighting, I didn't tell my family. It was just about me and what I wanted to do. "My mum has always seen the positive light of fighting rather than the health issues and I've always been on the road to winning and glory. "She's had a few tough times and a few scares when I've lost as an amateur, but we bounce back, and for all the good times she's forgot about the bad times we've had."	Anthony Joshua says he will be competing at a "whole new level" when he takes on Wladimir Klitschko in Saturday's world title bout.
The 31-year-old, Fulham's top scorer in 2013-14, will join the Potters on a two-year deal on 1 July. "Steve was much in demand and we are delighted to have won the race to secure his signature," said Stoke chief executive Tony Scholes. I'm sure he will prove to be an excellent addition The former Chelsea player is the club's second signing of the summer following the capture of Phil Bardsley. They are "hopeful" of landing ex-Manchester United striker Mame Biram Diouf from Hannover 96 as Mark Hughes seeks to strengthen a squad that achieved the club's record Premier League points tally last season. Hughes signed Sidwell, who has made more than 180 appearances in the Premier League, while working as Fulham manager in 2011. The former Arsenal trainee played in all 38 of the Cottagers' top-flight fixtures in 2013-14, scoring seven goals. "Like Phil Bardsley, Steve brings great experience to our squad and I'm sure he will prove to be an excellent addition to our squad," said Scholes. Sidwell, who has also played for Reading and Aston Villa, wrote on Twitter he was "saddened" his time at Craven Cottage had ended.	Stoke City have signed midfielder Steve Sidwell on a free transfer following his release by relegated Fulham.
The name is expressed with affection by some, with hostility by others, but it calls up history for everyone. The story of his life is very much the story of our times: revolutionary movements, the Cold War, East v West, North v South, communism v capitalism - except that most of the world has passed him by. Fidel Castro has remained the same, a symbol of revolution, a communist who has survived the fall of communism. Before surgery took him out of public view in July 2006, he inspired his followers with slogans and five-hour speeches. Fidel's views continued to be made public though in the form of editorials and occasional TV appearances. Fidel maintained his rule with an iron grip, sending opponents to prison for years. Throughout his leadership, he railed against the US, its economic and trade embargo and against the evils of free markets Fidel has been praised for standing up for the oppressed of Latin America, for opposing the Yankee imperialist, for making Cuba into a more equal society than many, for developing Cuba's health service and sending doctors abroad to help others. And it wasn't only doctors he sent abroad. He despatched troops to Angola and Ethiopia in support of fellow revolutionaries. His hand was seen in many a revolutionary movement in his own continent. But he has also been condemned for intolerance, for keeping his people poor and for refusing to see the benefits of economic liberalisation that even the communists of China have embraced. Fidel Castro stopped his people from leaving the island, leading them to risk their lives in rickety boats to try to get out. At one stage in the early years of the Reagan administration he was accused of trying to take over Central America for the Soviet Union by revolution. Washington at that time saw a path that led from the guerrillas of El Salvador through Nicaragua to Cuba and right up to the door of the Kremlin. Cuban assistance to the small and then revolutionary island of Grenada in the Caribbean prompted a full-scale US invasion. Throughout his rule, President Castro remained in almost permanent confrontation with the United States - and it with him. The American embargo on Cuba has been used by both sides - as a policy by the US to isolate Cuba and as an excuse by Fidel Castro for the island's poverty. US President Barack Obama and Castro's successor as president, younger brother Raul, announced a thawing in relations in 2015 but the embargo remains in place. When Mr Obama visited earlier this year - the first by a US leader in more than half a century - Castro remained defiant, saying Cuba did not need any gifts from the "empire" in a damning letter. He cut a giant figure on the world stage during the 47 years he controlled Cuba - at one point bringing the US and the Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war. It was the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 that propelled him into worldwide prominence. Before that he had been just a glamorous revolutionary leader. He had overthrown the dictator Batista in a classic guerrilla war and had fought off an American-led invasion by Cuban exiles on the Bay of Pigs in 1961. But when Nikita Khrushchev decided, with Fidel Castro's agreement, to station nuclear missiles in Cuba itself, the island leader turned from being a thorn in the side of the Americans into being a mortal threat. It was only the skilled diplomacy of Jack Kennedy (and of Khrushchev in the end) that saved the day, and Fidel's own island from destruction. The then-US defence Secretary Robert McNamara met President Castro in 1992. He said the Cuban leader told him there were 162 nuclear missiles in Cuba at the time of the crisis. He asked Castro if he had recommended they be used. The answer was: "Yes, I did." "And what would have happened to Cuba?" Mr McNamara asked him. "It would have been destroyed." Fidel Castro was not part of the diplomacy that ended the missile crisis. But he came out of the crisis remarkably strengthened. Kennedy promised that the US would not invade Cuba, a promise that has held. The CIA made efforts to get rid of him with bizarre plots involving the Mafia and poison. They came to nothing. President Castro's people took immense precautions to protect him from potential harm from food and drink, as diplomats who invite him to their receptions in Havana found out. He survived harm from his enemies. And whatever happens to Cuba after him, the name of Fidel will survive in history.	He is instantly recognisable both from his appearance - the beard and the military fatigues - and from his first name alone: Fidel.
The police said four men carried out the assault at Altcar Park in the Galliagh area just before 04:00 GMT on Thursday. It is believed that one of the gang had a handgun. They escaped in a small silver car. The victim did not need hospital treatment. Police have appealed for information.	A 24-year-old man has been beaten by an armed gang in a paramilitary-style attack in Londonderry.
Dramatic video footage emerged showing the TransAsia Airways plane clipping a bridge as it came down shortly after take-off from a Taipei airport. The plane, carrying 58 people, broke up as it plunged into Taipei's Keelung River. The fuselage was later salvaged by crane. There were 15 survivors pulled from the wreckage but 12 people remain missing. Television footage showed some passengers wading clear of the sunken wreckage and a toddler being pulled out alive by rescuers. Emergency teams cut open the plane while it was in the water but were unable to reach the passengers trapped in the front section of the fuselage. As night fell, a crane was used to lift the wreckage on to the bank. The death toll was expected to rise as rescue teams searched the fuselage and the river for the 12 missing passengers. "At the moment, things don't look too optimistic," Wu Jun-hong, a Taipei fire department official coordinating the rescue effort told reporters. The ATR-72 turbo-prop plane had just taken off from Taipei Songshan Airport and was heading to the Kinmen islands, just off the coast of the south-eastern Chinese city of Xiamen. It is the second TransAsia ATR-72 to crash in seven months, following an accident last July which killed 48 people and injured 15. The final communication from the pilots to air traffic control was "Mayday, mayday, engine flame out", according to a recording played on local media. The recording was not immediately verified by aviation officials. Yet again, we are looking at shocking pictures of a plane crash. You'd be forgiven for thinking that flying is getting more dangerous, but it's not. In fact, when you look at the number of crashes and fatalities compared to the huge number of people flying today, we are in a golden era of aircraft safety. According to safety analysts Ascend, 2014 was narrowly the safest year ever, with one fatal accident per 2.38 million flights, compared to every 1.91 million flights in 2013. That does not include the loss of the Malaysian airliner over Ukraine, where 298 people died, which they count as a war loss rather than an accident. Nearly a thousand people died in 2014, which is 700 more than the year before. Horrible numbers but compare that to the worst year, 1972, when 2,370 passengers were killed. There was far less flying then, maybe a quarter of what there is today. Nothing is ever without risk, but the chances of dying in an aircraft "accident" are lower than ever. Flight controllers lost contact with the plane at 10:55 local time (02:55 GMT). Footage of the plane filmed from inside passing cars showed it banking sharply, hitting a taxi and clipping the bridge before crashing into the river. "I saw a taxi, probably just metres ahead of me, being hit by one wing of the plane," an eyewitness told local media. "The plane was huge and really close to me. I'm still trembling." TV footage showed rescuers standing on the tail section of the broken wreckage trying to pull passengers out of the plane with ropes. One Taiwanese father told reporters he managed to rescue his wife before noticing his two-year-old son was still trapped underwater. The boy was later rescued but is believed to be in critical condition. The majority of the plane, including the front section of the fuselage and the wings, was submerged after it plunged into the Keelung River. Jaime Molloy, an English teacher who has lived in Taipei for three-and-a-half years and works near the scene of the crash, told the BBC: "The most disturbing scenes I saw were the debris, which included carry-on luggage and personal effects, as well as parts of the plane." TransAsia said it had contacted relatives of all the 22 Taiwanese passengers on board and was attempting to reach relatives of the Chinese nationals. Among the 15 injured, there were 11 from Taiwan, three from China and one member of the crew. The airline said that one injured passenger had already been discharged from hospital. The BBC's Cindy Sui in Taipei says the Chinese tourists could have been on their way home as many people come to Taiwan through Kinmen island. TransAsia chief Chen Xinde offered a "deep apology" in a televised news conference, but said his planes had been "under thorough scrutiny" since mid-2014. "Both our planes and our flight safety system are following strict regulations, so we also want to know what caused the new plane model to crash, but I don't want to speculate," he said. The plane's flight data recorders, also known as black boxes, have been recovered.	A plane carrying mostly Chinese tourists has crashed into a river in Taiwan, killing at least 31 people.
Symantec says the Wifatch program is closing loopholes and fixing bugs on routers it infects. Routers are being increasingly targeted by criminals keen to steal data or to help with large-scale web attacks. Symantec has monitored the network of "vaccinated" devices but, so far, has not seen it put to malicious use. Wifatch was first discovered in late 2014 and since then has been steadily scouring the web for routers and other smart devices running vulnerable software. In a blogpost, Symantec said that once Wifatch finds and infects a vulnerable router it connects to other compromised devices to download software updates that make them harder to attack successfully. In addition, it said, Wifatch tries to disinfect devices that have been compromised by malicious software. It regularly reboots devices to kill off malware running on them and return them to a clean state. As far as Symantec can tell, Wifatch's payload has no malicious components and the growing network of compromised devices has never been used for attacks, said Symantec security analyst Mario Ballano. The software also leaves a message on the router telling its owner to change the default passwords and update the firmware that controls the device. Wifatch targets a wide variety of home routers that run variations of the Linux operating system. Symantec said that "tens of thousands" of gadgets were harbouring Wifatch. About a third of all the devices it had hit were in China with Brazil and Mexico making up another quarter of its victims. Symantec remained cautious about the intentions of Wifatch despite its benign appearance. "Wifatch is a piece of code that infects a device without user consent and, in that regard, is the same as any other piece of malware," said Mr Ballano. "It should also be pointed out that Wifatch contains a number of general-purpose back doors that can be used by the author to carry out potentially malicious actions," he added.	A benevolent virus has been used to harden more than 10,000 home routers against cyber-attacks, says a security firm.
He was a surprise choice to lead the Fifa investigation, and ruffled feathers at football's governing body. On one occasion, he turned up unannounced to interview members of the senior executive committee who had cast votes in the World Cup bids. Even before he dismissed Fifa's report as "erroneous", there were signs that he was not afraid to pick a fight with his employers. In an interview last year he said his authority was to investigate "any official, top down, for misconduct... no-one is above the ethics code". He acknowledged that he took on the investigation as an outsider. "I come into this case with no history or experience of what might have happened," he said. "I will look at the facts and my jurisdiction and make decisions on whether the ethics code was violated." In a recent talk to lawyers in London about ethics in sport, Mr Garcia said Fifa's ethic's code needed transparency and leadership - a comment seen as a thinly veiled critique of Fifa boss Sepp Blatter. He eventually quit Fifa in December 2014, saying that a "lack of leadership" at the organisation had led to his decision. Mr Garcia made his name in his native New York, serving as a federal prosecutor with the Southern District of New York from 1992 to 2001 and working on a series of high-profile cases. These included the prosecution of four defendants for the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993, and the investigation into the 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He once told his daughter that his goal was "to punish people who do bad things and break the law". In March 2003 President George W Bush appointed Mr Garcia, a Republican, as assistant secretary for immigration and customs enforcement. The post put him in charge of more than 20,000 staff and a budget of more than $4bn. Later he moved back to New York's Southern District, serving as a US attorney from 2005-2008. There he supervised investigations into securities fraud, bringing a series of insider trading prosecutions. An investigation he led ultimately forced the resignation of Democratic governor Eliot Spitzer over a prostitution scandal. But he also took on some major international corruption and fraud cases, including the oil-for-food programme in Iraq and alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by the Norwegian energy firm Statoil. He is currently a partner at private US law firm Kirkland and Ellis, and it was from here that he was chosen by Fifa in 2012 to lead the investigation into the bidding process that awarded the World Cup to Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022. A year later he was among 18 Americans barred from entering Russia in Moscow's response to the Magnitsky List, which banned Russian officials from the US. Married to an FBI agent, he has kept largely out of the media spotlight and has not run for public office, despite speculation that he could be in a strong position to do so.	Michael Garcia, the American lawyer hired by Fifa to investigate the World Cup bidding process before criticising the organisation's summary of his own report and eventually resigning, is a former prosecutor with a history of launching corruption probes.
The Iridis4 has state of the art coprocessors which can each perform a trillion calculations per second - a measurement known as a "teraflop". The university said the new machine would allow academics to work on more projects at faster speeds. Iridis4 will be used for subjects such as engineering, archaeology and medicine, as well as computer science. Pro vice-chancellor Prof Philip Nelson said: "Staying ahead of the game in high performance computing [HPC] is vital to help the university stay competitive. "Simulation and computation enabled by HPC are recognised globally as the third pillar of modern research and this investment will ensure we remain world leaders in this field." Iridis4 will be used for a range of research, including engineering, archaeology and medicine, as well as computer science. The world's most powerful computer is China's Tianhe-2, which can perform 33,860 trillion calculations per second. The university said its new computer ranked among the top 10 in the UK. The most powerful is at the Science and Technology Facilities Council in Warrington. Others are based at the University of Edinburgh, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and the United Kingdom Meteorological Office.	A £3.2m supercomputer, one of the most powerful in the UK, has been installed at the University of Southampton.
The ex-Bury player scored from close in, just as the visitors looked set to hold on for an unlikely point. Stefan Scougall hit the bar as the Blades dominated before Jacob Mellis was sent off for a foul on Matt Done. They had two second-half efforts cleared off the line and Leon Clarke had a goal disallowed before Greg Leigh was sent off for a second yellow. The win kept United in second place in League One, six points off leaders Scunthorpe, while Bury are just two points off the relegation places after their ninth consecutive league defeat.

The giant striker was in the right place at the right time to bundle home the loose ball, after Morecambe's defence failed to clear, earning what could be an important draw. They dropped to 11th, but remain just a point behind Blackpool in the final play-off spot and within two points of sixth-placed Carlisle. Gareth Ainsworth's side had fallen behind eight minutes earlier when Morecambe veteran Kevin Ellison scored a superb opener. Ellison received the ball with his back to goal on the edge of the area but turned quickly and curled a delightful effort past Jamal Blackman from the edge of the box. The first half saw no goals, but plenty of endeavour from both sides. Blackman was the busier of the two keepers making three excellent saves from three different players. His best was a flying effort to tip away Michael Rose's 30-yard drive which was heading for the top right-hand corner of the Wycombe goal The on-loan Chelsea goalkeeper then did well to tip over Paul Mullin's drive and a low volley from Ellison that was destined for the bottom left-hand corner.

Helen Zille said the "time was right" for her to step aside, adding that the DA would benefit from fresh blood. She will remain as premier of Western Cape province until 2019. Ms Zille, a former journalist and anti-apartheid campaigner, has led the party since 2007. "These kinds of decisions are a long time coming, but in the end they are made suddenly," she said. Ms Zille was born in 1951 to German immigrants. She has been a staunch defender of South Africa's liberal constitution, keeping a check on the leading ANC party's overwhelming power. In the past, she has openly criticised President Jacob Zuma and led a campaign to bring him before the courts to face allegations of bribery. Mr Zuma denied the claims, insisting he was the victim of a "political conspiracy". The DA's support is mainly concentrated in the Western Cape, which has a large white and mixed-race population, but Ms Zille had tried to make inroads into the black electorate.	The leader of South Africa's opposition, the Democratic Alliance, has said she will not stand for re-election at the party's congress next month.
Sepsis can lead to shock and rapid organ failure following an infection. A snapshot of 290 hospital patients showing signs of sepsis found only 12% were initially screened and treated in line with best practice. Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said more needed to be done and he was "open minded" about potential options. Last year, more than 7,500 people were admitted to hospitals with sepsis. It can be treated effectively with antibiotics - if spotted quickly enough. Research, due to be published later this week, was led by intensive care consultant Dr Tamas Szakmany. "We have seen in our study this year there was big variation in how the clinical teams were responding to sepsis," said Dr Szakmany. "There are important pockets of very good practice and we have seen there are hospitals, there are health boards, where the response is less good." The issue is the focus for BBC Wales' Week In Week Out programme, following Welsh weatherman Derek Brockway as he explores how his own father Cliff died of sepsis last year. On 30 December 2014, 17-year-old Chloe Christopher collapsed and died after developing sepsis. Her mother Michelle told Derek Brockway about the heartbreaking last moments of her daughter's life. The Welsh health secretary told the forecaster: "We have got a health improvement programme. "We are the first country within the UK to have this early warning score system... but it has always been about how consistently that has been adhered to. "If we level out that variation, we will end up saving more lives. So I wouldn't pretend to you or anyone else that we are perfect where we are." Mr Gething said he is considering whether to make hospitals screen patients with symptoms in the same way. "I am open minded to that, absolutely," he said. "I am not going to run away from choices to be made about improving the service." Early indications from the second annual snapshot by Dr Szakmany's team, expected to be published next year, suggest there has been an improvement.	A killer condition linked to 1,500 deaths every year in Wales is not always being treated in the same way in Welsh hospitals, new research claims.
The 22-year-old striker was one of three AC Milan players targeted during their match against Roma on Sunday, which was halted for two minutes. "If it happens one more time, I'm going to leave the pitch, because it's so stupid," the Italy international said. "I was about to leave, but they will think I wanted to leave because we had difficulty with the game." AC Milan were down to 10 men at the time when the Serie A fixture at their San Siro stadium was temporarily stopped. The game only restarted after the visiting Roma supporters were ordered to cease their behaviour. Roma, who were fined 50,000 euros (£42,400) by the Italian Football League for the incident, released a statement on Monday condemning the actions of their supporters and promised to "face this issue head-on". The punishment was criticised by Fifa president Sepp Blatter, who told the world governing body's website: "They have not made any investigation of what happened. Just to give a pecuniary sanction is not valid, not acceptable." Balotelli, who has scored 11 goals in 12 games since his January switch from Manchester City, said the incident had altered his thinking about the best way to tackle the problem. He told CNN: "I always said if it happens in the stadium, I would just behave as if nobody had done anything and that I don't care, but now I think I've changed my mind a bit." There have been a number of incidents this season involving racial abuse of AC Milan's players. A January friendly between Milan and Pro Patria was suspended because of racist chants aimed at Kevin-Prince Boateng. The following month, Inter Milan were fined 50,000 euros after their fans were found to have abused their former player Balotelli in the Milan derby. And in April, champions Juventus were fined 30,000 euros (£25,000) after their supporters racially abused the AC Milan players.	Mario Balotelli has threatened to walk off the pitch if he is ever again subjected to racist abuse from fans.
Glamorgan's total was dominated by Nick Selman's mature 101 off 144 balls, his second first-class century. But seamers Matt Taylor and Craig Miles made sure wickets fell at regular intervals in cloudy conditions in the Welsh capital. Gloucestershire struggled in turn as the bowlers remained on top all day. Selman's century, after being dropped on eight in the first over, was a welcome return to form for the Brisbane-born opener after a string of low scores following his hundred against Northants at Swansea. Aneurin Donald's quick-fire 36 off 30 balls was the next best contribution as Taylor and Miles prospered in the afternoon. Graham Wagg and Timm van der Gugten scrambled Glamorgan to a consolation bonus point. Gloucestershire's innings was a question of survival in the evening gloom, with the day ending evenly balanced. Glamorgan are being led by Michael Hogan for the first time in the absence of Jacques Rudolph, who has a neck problem. Glamorgan batsman Nick Selman told BBC Wales Sport: "It was good to get some runs for a change, the wicket was a bit slow and they bowled a bit short early on so I got through the first 25 overs and it got easier to bat from there, but it was a bit disappointing to get out just after I got a hundred. "(My season) was going well up until after (a century in) Swansea, after Swansea four ducks in a row, but it was good to spend some time in the middle at Northants. "Opening the batting in county cricket over here (in the UK), it's definitely hard, you get some good balls, you play on some green wickets and I was struggling a bit. "I was happy to get a few today and hopefully I can continue that for the rest of the season." Gloucestershire seamer Matt Taylor told BBC Radio Bristol: "There's definitely a bit on offer out there (for the bowlers), we didn't start exactly how we'd like but we got there in the end and we'd take bowling them out for 220. "I was pretty happy with that (hitting the stumps three times), the same plan as always is to hit the top of off-stump and luckily they missed them today. "I was pleased to get an opportunity in T20 and the white-ball stuff this year, now I'm getting an opportunity with the red ball it's great. "It's definitely going to be tough (for the Gloucestershire batsmen), they're a good bowling attack but hopefully we can dig in and get to a reasonable score."	Gloucestershire finished day one on 62-3 in reply to Glamorgan's 220 all out at the SSE Swalec Stadium in Cardiff.
England will play their first day-night Test when they host West Indies at Edgbaston in August. Yorkshire say they were asked by England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) about their willingness to move one of the Championship games at Headingley and would be interested in doing so. The club's chief executive Mark Arthur called it a "great opportunity". He said: "Until the fixture programme is published, we don't know when it will be or who the opposition is likely to be. But because we have got the best lights in the country for cricket purposes, then it's likely that we would be one of the selected grounds to host such an event. "Hopefully when the fixture list comes out, it's something that all members and stakeholders will save a date for in their diary. "Whether you're a club cricketer or a member who works 9-5 you'll be able to come along and watch two or three hours of Championship cricket after work and it will be very interesting to see what the uptake is on this initiative." The start of the second ever day-night Test match between Pakistan and West Indies earlier in October drew a crowd of just 68 in Dubai.	Yorkshire have said they would be interested in hosting a day-night game in the County Championship in 2017.
England seamer James Anderson, who took 3-5 on the third evening, finished with figures of 4-20 as the Red Rose skittled Hampshire for 168 on day four. The visitors had resumed on 50-5, still trailing by 148, and were unable to make Lancashire bat again. Dane Vilas' 244 had put the home team in control earlier in the match. Alex Davies and Ryan McLaren also chipped in with centuries to give Lancashire a big first-innings lead, but it was their impressive bowling display in Hampshire's second innings that ensured victory. Anderson's 15 overs cost only 20 runs as he tore through the visitors' top order, while McLaren (3-41) and Kyle Jarvis (3-49) did the rest of the damage. England's all-time leading wicket-taker Anderson was playing in his first match after a month out through injury, with his country's first Test of the summer against South Africa starting on 6 July. Gareth Berg, the last Hampshire wicket to fall, top-scored with 49, while James Vince's 29 was the next best individual effort. Lancashire have gone above Hampshire and Yorkshire up to second in Division One, 14 points behind leaders Essex, who beat Warwickshire - also by an innings. England fast bowler James Anderson told BBC Radio Lancashire: "Not many people would have expected Essex and Lancashire to be first and second after seven games but we're in a really strong position and we have a lot of competition for places. "We're not going to get carried away. We now have a big game against Warwickshire and, if we get a result there, it will put us in a great position before the back end of the summer. "We're better placed to sustain this position but we have to make sure that what happened last year doesn't happen again. This week was a really good performance but there are still areas on which we can improve. "Al Davies, Dane Vilas and Ryan McLaren got us up to a really good score. Dane and Ryan are really solid professionals who have been fantastic additions. And we thought if we could put the ball in the right areas we could really challenge them and take 10 wickets." Hampshire coach Craig White told BBC Radio Solent: "It was going to be a big ask. But to fold again on a pretty good pitch is extremely disappointing. "Bergy tried and there was a bit of fight there at the end, but it was too much to ask really. "Anderson bowled beautifully, but the ball's allowed to swing and we should be able to combat that. "It seems that if the ball does swing or seam we get in a bit of trouble. We need to work on that, improve on that, try and stay positive, and get back on the horse, so to speak."	Lancashire moved up to second in the County Championship table after thrashing Hampshire by an innings and 30 runs at Old Trafford.
Media playback is not supported on this device After an even first 30 minutes, Danny Wright tapped in from James Dayton's free-kick to put the Robins in front. But Tubbs levelled after the restart, latching onto Maxime Biamou's header and slotting in from 10 yards out. Robert Dickie headed against the bar for the Robins late on, before Deacon fired in to win the game in added time. Sutton have won just one of their past eight games in the National League - including a 6-0 home defeat by Dover on Tuesday - but Deacon's late heroics earned them a place in third round for the first time in 22 years. The U's have twice gone even further in the competition, reaching the fourth round in 1970, and again in 1989 after they famously beat First Division Coventry City in round three. They will receive £27,000 for getting through the second round, and could earn a lucrative tie with Premier League or Championship opposition when the third round draw takes place on Monday.

In the app, the cartoon characters feature with the real world in the background. The developers claim it is the first time in the UK that "augmented reality" has been used in this way. They and Conwy council hope it will bring tourists to the town where the inspiration for Alice went on holiday. The original launch of the app in August was delayed after key figures for tourists to follow were altered. Virtual characters failed to recognise sculptures in the town after Conwy council painted them. Next year marks 150 years since Alice in Wonderland was first published. Simon Burrows, co-director of Alice in Wonderland Limited which has co-ordinated the project, said: "People who use the app can look at Llandudno landmarks on screen, while characters from the Alice books tell the story behind them. "It's also possible to take a picture of yourself or your friends standing next to the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat or Alice herself." The Alice in Wonderland story, and its sequel Through the Looking Glass, were written by Lewis Carroll (whose real name was Charles Dodgson). He composed the original story to entertain a young girl called Alice Liddell, with whose family he was friends. Alice Liddell's family lived in Oxford but had a house in Llandudno and spent many of their holidays there. Company director Barry Mortlock said: "I've lived in Llandudno for 36 years now, and it worried me that the town wasn't doing enough in recent years to celebrate its links with the real life Alice. "The app is now ready for next year's important anniversary. "It has the potential to attract more visitors from overseas, where there's a huge interest in the Alice in Wonderland stories." Graham Rees, Conwy council's cabinet member for tourism, said: "This will be a huge asset to Llandudno and really enhance what we can offer to visitors."	Characters from the Alice in Wonderland books will guide visitors on a tour of Llandudno in a new app which shows the town's links with the stories.
All 12,000 pupils are offered milk, fruit juice, cereal and toast in a bid to benefit their performance in school. Blackpool Council will decide on 17 June whether to extend its Â£1.3m scheme, which began in January, until the end of March 2014. Northumbria University researchers have examined the scheme's benefits. Dr Margaret Anne Defreyter, director of healthy living at Northumbria University, said: "Blackpool's free school breakfast scheme is one of the largest schemes operating within the UK. SOURCE: University of Northumbria Teachers say school meals leave pupils hungry "The overall findings of the evaluation of the Blackpool scheme are very positive and based on these findings I strongly recommend that the scheme continues." Simon Blackburn, the Labour leader of Blackpool Council, said: "It was clear from that first day that the scheme would be a success. Across Blackpool children were coming to school hungry and struggling to concentrate. "I am proud of the bold decision we made to trial this scheme, a move that no other council has made, and I've even prouder today to see the results of the research." Neil Hodgkins, head teacher of Devonshire Primary School, said: "Children who had previously had nothing, or very little, to eat first thing are now enjoying a nutritious start to the day and presenting themselves as being livelier, more alert and ready to perform better in class. "Although it is still early days to be quantifying this in terms of academic results or attainment value, we are seeing other benefits such as improved punctuality and attendance." The researchers from Northumbria University have recommended that the council should continue to evaluate the "long term educational attainment and short term cognitive performance" of pupils.	A pilot scheme offering free breakfasts to primary school children in Blackpool has improved their health and punctuality, say researchers.
The Taiwanese firm, also known as Foxconn Technology, posted a net profit of NT$37bn ($1.2bn; Â£814m) in the October to December quarter. It also reported a 16% jump in full year profit for 2012 to NT$94.8bn. Foxconn is the world's biggest contract electronics maker and Apple is one of its biggest clients. According to some estimates, orders from Apple account for almost half of Foxconn's total revenue. In the October to December quarter, Apple had sold 47.8 million iPhones, up from 37 million a year earlier. Meanwhile, the launch of iPad mini, also boosted sales of its tablet PCs - it sold 22.9 million iPads, compared with 15.4 million in the same period in 2011. However, the heavy reliance on Apple has also raised concerns that Foxconn's growth may slow in the coming months. Some analysts said the rapid rate of growth that smartphones and tablet PCs had seen in recent years could not be sustained. "In most of the developed economies, smartphones are at a mature penetration stage and tablets are pretty close to being at that stage," said Andrew Milroy of consultancy firm Frost & Sullivan. Mr Milroy added that Apple had so far not been able to replicate the success it enjoyed in the developed economies in emerging markets. He explained that in the emerging economies, Apple products were still very expensive and out of reach for many consumers. At the same time, Apple is facing increased competition from other smartphone makers in those markets. "They are being hammered by low-cost smartphones in countries such as China," he said. The fear is that if Apple's growth rate slows, it will have a knock on effect on suppliers such as Foxconn.	Hon Hai Precision Industry, a major assembler of Apple products, has posted record quarterly profits helped by growing demand for iPhones and iPads.
According to three separate analyses, a flood of automated comments to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was detected over the weekend. More than 400,000 comments with remarkably similar wording have been detected in recent days. Net neutrality proponents argue that all internet traffic should be equal. This means that no content provider should be able to, for example, charge more for faster access to certain data. One expert described bot activity as a new form of protest. "Someone has gone out of their way to make these seem like real submissions," wrote Chris Sinchok in a blog post about the apparently automated activity. Having downloaded the comments and associated data, Mr Sinchok noticed that the names and email addresses associated with thousands of them also turned up in lists of personal data stolen from websites. He told the BBC that this suggested someone might be using information collected from breached databases to make the submissions look more authentic. "It really seems like this is getting pooled from some place in an automated fashion and it's coming in at unreasonable rates," he said. He added that the uniformity of the data was also a possible giveaway. For example, many comments are essentially identical save for the occasional, small difference - such as the exact same sentence appearing in multiple comments, but with different letters capitalised each time. And the rate at which comments were posted also seemed suspicious, starting and stopping in bursts, he added. Other watchers, including a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and another at Harvard University, have also tracked a boom in apparently automated activity directed at the site in recent days. Earlier this month, the FCC said it had been targeted by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that led to downtime for the comments system. This followed a television appearance by comedian John Oliver in which he urged people to post comments against the proposals on the FCC's website. "Net neutrality is such a hot-button issue and it's one of the few examples of online activism that's actually amounted to something," noted Prof Phil Howard at the Oxford Internet Institute. He cited the 2014 online protests, after which President Obama stepped in to recommend that the FCC drop earlier proposals to curtail net neutrality. "This is how people protest these days," said Prof Howard, referring to the apparently automated comments. He also pointed out that a growing number of people had the necessary programming skills to do it. However, Mr Sinchok is concerned that the bot activity will create the impression that genuine opposition to the FCC's current proposals does not really exist. "There are people that care about this issue a lot," he told the BBC. "Activity like this is really muddying the waters - and I don't want it to give [the FCC] an excuse to say, 'Hey, there's mixed support for this.'" The FCC has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment.	Bots appear to be spamming a US regulator's website over a proposed reversal of net neutrality rules, researchers have said.
Early goals from Kazenga LuaLua and Tomer Hemed gave Albion a 2-0 lead at half-time but the home side fought back after the break. Freddie Sears tapped in to pull one back and substitute David McGoldrick equalised from the spot after Bruno fouled Ryan Fraser. But Hemed nodded in two minutes later to hand the Seagulls victory. Brighton wore black armbands to pay tribute to Matt Grimstone and Jacob Schilt, two victims of the Shoreham air crash, while Albion goalkeeper David Stockdale wore a special shirt in the warm-up and personalised gloves bearing the duo's names. Ipswich and Brighton had both made unbeaten starts to the league campaign, each taking 10 points from four games, but the visitors stunned Portman Road with two quick first-half goals. First LuaLua latched on to a ball forward from Gaetan Bong and drove a low left-footed shot across Dean Gerken, and then Hemed got a faint touch on Dale Stephens' free-kick. Media playback is not supported on this device Sears twice went close for Ipswich just before the break, while Albion defender Uwe Hunemeier was lucky not to receive a second yellow card for a high foot. Town boss Mick McCarthy made a double substitution at half-time and, after Stephens drove a shot against the upright for Brighton, he was rewarded when Sears pounced to score after Brett Pitman had hit the post. The home side were level on 65 minutes when McGoldrick held his nerve from the spot but moments later Hemed got his second from LuaLua's deflected cross to restore Brighton's lead. Bobby Zamora came on as a late substitute for his first appearance since re-joining Brighton this summer, and the former England striker helped the Seagulls to close out the game. The Sussex club are now three points clear at the top of the Championship table heading into the international break. Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: "I think Brighton are a very good side, they started well and were the better team. "In the first half they were excellent - you have to give them credit. But I thought our response in the second half was great. "Then their third goal came off a deflected cross which wrong-footed my defenders, though we also made a few little errors leading up to it. "Now we know what everyone else (in the league) feels like." Brighton boss Chris Hughton: "It was a super game and a very good spectacle for the Championship. "We were the better team at 2-0, but the only disappointment for me was that we allowed them to come back to 2-2, which I didn't think was a fair reflection of the game. "But we showed great character to go on and win the game and overall I thought we had the right balance between defending well and breaking quickly."	Brighton beat Ipswich Town in a five-goal thriller to leapfrog the Tractor Boys and go top of the Championship.
The Procession to Calvary, completed in 1602, will remain on show at Nostell Priory in West Yorkshire. The painting had been put up for sale for £2.7m. A campaign by The Art Fund and National Trust raised £1.7m. The National Heritage Memorial Fund, which aims to save key historic items, has now stepped in with the final £1m. The painting depicts Christ carrying the cross on his way to crucifixion and has hung at Nostell Priory, a stately home near Wakefield, for 200 years. The priory is the family home of Lord St Oswald, who put it up for sale to pay for the restoration of the estate. He had said he would put it up for auction if the target was not reached by Christmas. Members of the public donated £680,000 to the campaign, with almost £510,000 coming from trusts and foundations, while The Art Fund gave a further £500,000. Art Fund director Dr Stephen Deuchar said: "Considering the economic climate, this has been a hugely challenging campaign and we are enormously grateful to all our members and supporters who have given so generously. "Working with the National Trust has been a very fruitful experience, pooling our resources to pull out all the stops and save this remarkable painting for Nostell Priory and its visitors." Dame Jenny Abramsky, chair of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, said:  "The overwhelming public support to help secure this stunning painting has been an inspiration. "Individual giving combined with ongoing support from government funds such as the National Heritage Memorial Fund will play an increasingly important role in securing our most precious heritage." The fund's money comes from the Treasury and is intended to be the last resort for saving items of importance to the UK's national heritage. It has received £10m a year since 2007, but its grant will be halved from this year as a result of government cuts.	An Old Master by painter Pieter Brueghel the Younger will remain on public display after a government fund paid £1m to save it for the nation.
The 19-year-old is in her second year of competition at the Federation Internationale du Ski (FIS) snowboard cross World Cup circuit. Qualification for PyeongChang 2018 depends on points accumulated from races during the season of the Games. The 2018 games' opening ceremony takes place on 9 February 2018 in South Korea. Potter, who is from Bangor, said: "It [the Winter Olympics] is definitely on my mind, I'm still part of Olympic qualification. "I am just taking every race one step at a time and I'm not getting too ahead of myself and I am aiming for that. I just want to see how things turn out "I have still got time, I have still got a year to go." She competes in Germany this weekend looking to improve on her season best finish of 26th place claimed in the USA on 21 January.	Welsh snowboarder Maisie Potter says the 2018 Winter Olympics are on her mind a year away from the games' start.
George Hamilton was speaking to MPs on the Northern Ireland affairs committee. It is investigating how a UK exit from the EU could affect Northern Ireland. Mr Hamilton said the PSNI would "not take a position on exit or not" and would work with whatever circumstances are in place after the EU referendum. Voters will go to the polls in June to decide whether the UK should remain a member of the EU. Asked on whether an exit from the EU would affect policing, Mr Hamilton said: "I think all of this is probably doable with an exit, but it will be slower, complicated and more costly is the view we would take from a practical policing perspective." But he said the PSNI had a "very good working relationship" with a number of police forces in non-EU countries, "most notably America". Mr Hamilton, who appeared before the committee with Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr, also said he did not think the PSNI's link with the Irish police would suffer in the case of an exit from the EU. He said "the relationships are secure". He added that if a so-called Brexit - a shorthand term for a UK exit from the EU - took place he was "absolutely sure the quality of the relationship and the professionalism of both organisations would not be diminished". The committee is examining areas like the economy and the border with the Republic of Ireland. It has already heard evidence from a wide range of politicians and business leaders.	A UK withdrawal from the European Union could make policing in Northern Ireland slower, more complicated and more costly, the head of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has said.
Richard Davies, 41, died of a single gunshot wound to the chest after firing at officers in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, in October 2015. His widow Samantha said she had a text from her child saying they were tied up and begging her to "call the police". Mr Davies was shot after firing a gun from the house. The inquest continues. The father of three said he "wanted to end his life" after learning his marriage was over, the hearing in Peterborough was told earlier this week. More news from Cambridgeshire Giving evidence at the hearing, Mrs Davies said she had initially believed her husband had "some acceptance" about the end of their relationship and said "there wasn't an ounce of anger" during their conversation earlier that day. However, he had made several trips to a nearby shop to buy alcohol and had been carrying a knife, the inquest heard. Mrs Davies went to visit her sister and when her children returned to the family home their father tied them up. The inquest then heard how the children managed to make 999 calls and alert their mother. She received a text that read: "Call the police. Get them to come to our house. Dad's going to kill himself. He's tied us up. I'm not joking." When Mrs Davies arrived, one child had managed to escape. She said when Mr Davies came to the door "he didn't really look like my husband". He returned a short time later with a knife pointed at his chest, she told the hearing. Her other children managed to escape and Mrs Davies was taken to a neighbour's house. Mr Davies was shot dead by a police marksman after firing six shots from the house, the inquest heard. Mrs Davies said she had never seen his home-made gun or ammunition before, and her family was "forever changed" by what happened. The inquest continues.	The widow of a man shot dead by police has told an inquest of a desperate text sent by one of their children saying "dad's going to kill himself".
He said he was disappointed that judges ruled ministers could not invoke Article 50 - starting formal Brexit negotiations - without MPs' approval. Mr Cairns was at a breakfast meeting with business leaders in Cardiff. Welsh Conservative MP David Davies warned attempts to block Brexit could lead to an early general election. Mr Cairns told BBC Wales that there was an "obligation" on politicians in all UK parliaments to give firms certainty about the UK's departure from the European Union. "What investors and employers want is the direction of travel and that's what we're focused on," he said. The UK government has said it intends to appeal against Thursday's High Court ruling. First Minister Carwyn Jones has said that would be a mistake, but on Friday the Welsh Government announced it would apply to have a voice in the appeal. Mr Cairns claimed the UK was in a "strong position" on the Brexit negotiations as it had one of the world's fastest growing economies. He said he wanted to work with the Welsh Government to get "a good deal" for Wales, and also wanted to work with Europe. "It's in our interests that Europe grows and it's in Europe's interest that the UK and Welsh economies grow," he said. Mr Davies, MP for Monmouth and chair of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, warned that politicians seeking to keep the UK in the EU would now use the judges' decision to try to block Brexit. "There'll be members of parliament looking to find excuses and flaws in the legislation that the government bring forward and the negotiation package, if you like, to try and vote against it," he told BBC Radio Wales. "This is all about trying to undo the result of the referendum - let's be in no doubt about that." He added: "This could easily lead to an early general election if that's what it takes to get this sorted out." But Labour's Shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens said Parliament now needed to do its job and scrutinise the UK government's approach to Brexit. "How we leave the European Union was not on the ballot paper and there are a number of ways in which that could happen," she told BBC Radio Wales. "There's no consensus on that yet because the government haven't yet disclosed any details of how they intend to approach both the negotiations and the end point when we leave the EU. "So of course Parliament should scrutinise those plans - that's exactly what Parliament is there to do. "The court decision yesterday simply says, as we all knew, that Parliament has a clear role - a legal role, a constitutional role and an incredibly responsible role to try and influence how that exit happens." However, Pontypridd Labour MP Owen Smith told the BBC's Daily Politics programme he could "potentially" vote against the triggering of Article 50 in a Commons vote. "Most [Labour] colleagues feel that we couldn't possibly do anything other than trigger Article 50 - I disagree with them," he said. "If we have no further clarity as to whether Britain is going to be better or worse off as a result of the ending of the negotiations then I think the right thing for me to do on behalf of my constituents is not to vote to make them worse off."	Businesses need stability after the UK government's High Court defeat over the trigger for leaving the EU, Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns has said.
The west African nation branded the 54-member grouping, which includes the UK and most of its former colonies, a "neo-colonial institution". The withdrawal was announced on state TV but no other reasons were given. Two years ago President Yahya Jammeh accused the UK of backing his political opposition ahead of elections. Commonwealth officials said they only heard about the move through the media and had not yet been contacted by The Gambia. A spokesman said Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma had seen the reports with "dismay and disappointment" and had asked for "clarification" from the country. There is a history of tension between President Jammeh, who came to power in a 1994 coup, and the UK. Earlier this year, a Foreign Office report singled out The Gambia for its human rights record, citing cases of unlawful detentions, illegal closures of newspapers and discrimination against minority groups. On Thursday a Foreign Office spokesman said: "Decisions on Commonwealth membership are a matter for each member government. We would very much regret Gambia, or any other country, deciding to leave the Commonwealth." In August last year The Gambia was criticised by Amnesty International and others for executing nine prisoners by firing squad. The Commonwealth was founded in 1931 but acquired its modern shape after 1949 as former British colonies and protectorates, including The Gambia, started to achieve self-government and varying degrees of independence. According to the Commonwealth's charter, member states should communicate and co-operate "in the common interests of our peoples and in the promotion of international understanding and world peace". In its statement, The Gambian government said it had "withdrawn its membership of the British Commonwealth". It said it had "decided that The Gambia will never be a member of any neo-colonial institution and will never be a party to any institution that represents an extension of colonialism". But Bakary Dabo, former vice president of The Gambia and chairman of the country's campaign for democratic change, said people there are generally "very happy" to be part of the Commonwealth. He said the government had recently begun "picking up war against poorly specified enemies called 'western powers'". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Dabo said this rhetoric had "accelerated" in recent years and been used when President Jammeh gave a "rambling" speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month Also at the UN, President Jammeh said homosexuality was one of the three "biggest threats to human existence". He has also drawn international criticism for claiming he can cure Aids with a herbal body rub and bananas. BBC Africa analyst Farouk Chothia said despite its image as an idyllic holiday destination, The Gambia, and its population of less than two million, were kept under tight control by its eccentric leader. The latest decision was bound to come from him, our analyst added. The Royal Commonwealth Society, an education charity which works in Commonwealth countries, said The Gambia's announcement was unexpected and appeared to be undemocratic. Society director Michael Lake said President Jammeh had made the decision "without consulting The Gambia's people" and the country's withdrawal would be "a loss felt by both its people and the wider Commonwealth network". He added: "Far from being a 'neo-colonial institution', the modern Commonwealth operates on a consensus model and its voluntary membership is predicated primarily on a country's commitment to upholding shared values and principles." The last time a nation left the Commonwealth was in 2003, when Zimbabwe withdrew. The Queen, who is 87, is the head of the Commonwealth, which holds its next heads of government meeting in Colombo, Sri Lanka, next month. However, the gathering will be the first that the Queen has not attended since 1971. She will send her son, the Prince of Wales instead. Buckingham Palace said she would make fewer overseas trips because of her age. Three African countries have joined the Commonwealth in recent years. Rwanda was admitted in 2009 after applying for membership the previous year, while Cameroon and Mozambique became members in 1995.	The Gambia's decision to withdraw from the Commonwealth 48 years after joining is something to "very much regret", the UK Foreign Office has said.
She said the Games would bring "honour and pride" to the country. Ms Rousseff, who has seen her popularity plunge amid a serious economic crisis, says the country will rise to the challenge and will organise a safe and successful Games. She said 12,000 people would be chosen to carry the Olympic torch through some 300 Brazilian cities next year. "We are now 399 days from the opening of the Olympic Games and on August 5 the whole world will look at us, will see the Olympic flame light up," Ms Rousseff said at a ceremony in Brasilia. The torch relay will begin in the Brazilian capital in May and will end at Rio's Maracana stadium in August, at the Olympic's opening ceremony. The Olympics organising committee and sponsors will choose the torchbearers in the next few months. Each person will carry the torch for 300 metres. The relay will take the torch through the Federal District, where Brasilia is, and 26 states during 90 to 100 days. Ms Rousseff has promised security will be a priority, inviting the thousands of fans who travelled to Brazil for the football World Cup to return for the Rio Games. Members of the International Olympic Committee have expressed concern over delays in the works for the Games. Another major concern has been pollution in the waters of the Guanabara Bay, where the sailing and windsurfing events will be held. The authorities say they understand athletes' concerns but insist that water pollution will not pose a major health risk during the Olympics, which will be held in August 2016. "We are confident that we can meet the challenge before us," said Ms Rousseff. "We will put on a historic Olympics." Rio de Janeiro will be the first South American city to host the Olympics.	Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff has unveiled the torch to be used at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Mr Tsilikin, 54, was found on Thursday evening after friends and family had been unable to contact him. His mobile phone and computer are missing. Police have opened a murder inquiry. Mr Tsilikin was a well-known culture and arts critic, working on TV and radio as well as for print media such as Kommersant, Vogue and Elle. Mr Tsilikin had reportedly just returned from a trip to the Latvian capital, Riga. Friends and family last spoke to him at the end of last week. Mr Tsilikin was found with multiple knife wounds and it is believed he may have been dead for at least two days. The Russian Investigative Committee said a forensic investigation was being carried out and it had not ruled out "murder committed on domestic grounds". St Petersburg Union of Journalists chairwoman Lyudmila Fomichev told Kommersant: "This is a great tragedy for the entire journalistic community, because he was a very well-known, great journalist who wrote on culture and art." Mr Tsilikin, a graduate of the Leningrad State Institute of Music and Cinema, turned to journalism after the collapse of the Soviet Union, working for the newspaper Rush Hour and editing Culture and Society. He also worked on a number of TV and radio programmes, as well as other newspapers and magazines.	Noted Russian journalist Dmitry Tsilikin has been found stabbed to death in his flat in St Petersburg.
Davies, 47, led Forest to successive play-off campaigns while at the City Ground but had an uneasy relationship with the board and was sacked in June. When asked if he would go back to work for a new regime, Davies told BBC Late Kick Off: "I'd be delighted to go back. I have great feelings for the club. "I did want to get them to the Premier League. I'd love to finish that job." Forest have scored just 22 goals in 27 Championship games this season Forest, who have lost nine of their last 11 games, are third from bottom in the Championship and sit four points adrift of safety. Manager Steve Cotterill took over from Steve McClaren in October but, despite an initial upturn in form, the Reds have been in woeful form of late and have scored just four-goals in their last 11 matches. But Davies remains convinced they can turn things around: "I am sad to see what has happened," the former Preston and Derby boss added. "But I wish them well and have no doubt they will get out of their troubles. "The club deserve to be in the Premier League."	Ex-Nottingham Forest boss Billy Davies says he has "unfinished business" at the club and would love to return.
Scores more are still missing in Teluk Wondama district after flash floods and landslides that were triggered when a river burst its banks. Hundreds of people have been injured and more than 5,000 are being housed in tents set up in emergency camps. The National Search and Rescue Agency and military have sent reinforcements to help deal with the disaster. The sudden flooding on Monday caught residents by surprise, officials said, contributing to the high death toll. The local airport has now reopened and roads have been largely cleared of debris, which is helping to speed up aid deliveries to the area, reports say. Navy warships had previously been used to carry tents, medical supplies and food to the disaster zone. Thousands of buildings, roads and bridges in five villages have been damaged or destroyed. The head of the the provincial relief agency, Dortheis Sawaki, said 104 bodies had been recovered, but many more people were missing and the death toll was expected to rise. "It's a tragedy. The smell of rotting corpses is everywhere. Power is down. There's no clean water," she was quoted by AP as saying. Many parts of the country had been badly hit by heavy rains, winds and high waves this year, meteorologists said.	More than 100 people are now known to have died in flooding in the eastern Indonesian province of West Papua.
It is the first professional contract for the former Bristol Rovers trainee. "When my agent told me that Forest Green were interested I was totally thrilled," Davies told the club website. "I can't wait to get started." Forest Green - who finished second in the National League in 2015-16 - gave a first senior deal to 18-year-old striker Olly Mehew last Thursday.	Forest Green Rovers have signed Wales Under-19 international striker Blake Davies on a one-year deal.
Inciting people to harass others online, known as virtual mobbing, could also result in court action, under new Crown Prosecution Service guidance. The director of public prosecutions said it means the CPS would prosecute just as if offences occurred offline. But she stressed this did not mean prosecutors could "stifle free speech". The new guidance aims to help police identify online crimes more easily. It also highlights those who post people's personal information, such as bank details - known as doxxing. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said: "The internet's not an anonymous place where people can post without any consequences. People should think about their own conduct. "If you are grossly abusive to people, if you are bullying or harassing people online, then we will prosecute in the same way as if you did it offline." However, Ms Saunders said context will be an important factor in decisions - for example "if you're offensive, the legislation would say you have to be grossly offensive, and that's quite a high test". One woman, who wished to remain anonymous, said she and her daughter, who has Down's Syndrome, had suffered such severe online abuse over the last six years that they had to move house three times. The abuse started, she said, when a friend wrote a book about trolls - anonymously but mentioning her by name. "The trolls photoshopped images of myself and my daughter on to pornography and posted it on Facebook. They have said I'm a paedophile and called her hateful names like mongoloid; they even set up a website in her name." The woman believes the trolls kept getting hold of her details using official forms she submitted when complaining at the use of images of her daughter. "Even after we moved, they have called us at three of four in the morning threatening to petrol-bomb our house if we will not give up the name of the author. "It's been horrific - this trolling is not free speech; it's hate speech," she said. She added that one of the men stood outside the family home and followed her daughter to school, taking pictures. The incidents are now being investigated by police. Kevin Healey told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he had been abused online for five years over his autism campaign work. He said: "Not even one troll has been prosecuted or jailed, even though I have made complaints to Twitter and the police. "It's been a nightmare; it's been horrific - it doesn't go away. It's with you 24 hours and seven days a week, there's no escape from it". Mr Healey said he doesn't think the changes will make any difference and wants changes to legislation in the UK - and abroad. "With the laws in the UK, if someone is trolling you from outside the UK - and my last batch of trolls were from the US - the police said we can't do anything," he added. The CPS says it will use "considerable caution" before charging those posting "grossly offensive" material. The changes come after a report found that one in four teenagers is abused online over their sexual orientation, race, religion, gender or disability. The CPS also said underage "sexting" between consenting children in a relationship should not be prosecuted, but cases which involve "exploitation, grooming or bullying" may lead to legal action. Ms Saunders told the BBC: "If they are children, they are the same age, there's no suggestion or any coercion or bad motives, then we would not expect that case to be prosecuted. It shows you how careful you have to be about the context of it," she said. Asked about whether guidelines on misogynistic hate crimes would be introduced, Ms Saunders said: "We probably need to think about it." A new law on revenge porn - someone uploading explicit images or film of a former partner to humiliate or embarrass them - has led to the prosecution of 206 people across England and Wales since its introduction in April 2015. The public policy statements on hate crime will be subject to public consultation for 13 weeks.	Internet trolls who create derogatory hashtags or doctored images to humiliate others could face prosecution in England and Wales.
Launched last year, the widely unpopular programme saw presenters mingle with a live audience and included funny home-video clips. The BBC said it will now revert to its original Today at Wimbledon format. A spokesman said this year's show will "have a traditional look and feel" and will "bring highlights of the day's action and insight from our expert pundits". Last year, the corporation made major changes to its TV highlights coverage, replacing host John Inverdale with Clare Balding and introducing a chat show-style format. At the time, The Guardian said "the whole show is a mess", while a scathing review in the Daily Mail referred to it as "super right-on" and "tooth-achingly trendy". Mounting public criticism forced the corporation to tweak its format halfway through the tournament, eventually removing the studio audience altogether. "Last year we made some format changes to the programme which evolved throughout the championships based on feedback from our audience," the BBC spokesman said. This year will see the return of Today at Wimbledon, with Balding remaining as the host alongside two expert pundits. It will be shot from a new studio next to Henman Hill overlooking the All England Club grounds.	The BBC has confirmed it is scrapping Wimbledon highlights show 2Day.
The victim was killed on Wednesday about a mile from a West Glacier campground. The authorities say armed police officers are searching for the bear but gave no further details. Bear attacks are rare in the area with only 10 deaths reported since the park was created in 1910. The dead cyclist was a 38-year-old officer with the US Forest Service, Flathead County Sheriff Chuck Curry told Daily Inter Lake.com. Officials say the grizzly confronted two cyclists on a trail after they disturbed it. The dead rider was taken off his saddle by the bear and the other rode off to get help. The US Fish and Wildlife Service recently announced plans to remove grizzly bears from the threatened species list. Who, What, Why: What should you do if you encounter a bear?	A grizzly bear has attacked and killed a cyclist just outside the Glacier National Park in the northern US state of Montana, police say.
The 17-year-old boy was arrested at an address in Netherton, West Midlands Police said, and remains in custody. A 65-year-old man was attacked at 18:15 GMT in Owen Street, Kates Hill, Dudley, suffering serious stab wounds to his head, shoulder, chest and back. Police said he was now in a stable condition in hospital. Det Insp Greg Evans said: "Thankfully, the man is... recovering well in hospital. "We are still working to establish a motive for the attack and we are currently questioning a teenage boy, who was arrested yesterday afternoon."	A teenager has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a man was stabbed on his doorstep in the West Midlands on Tuesday.
The Electoral Commission said 38 MPs had highlighted people, including students, claiming to have voted twice, which is a criminal offence. It said individual electoral registers run by councils should be better joined up to help identify duplicate entries. Labour warned against making it harder for young people to register to vote. A record number of 46.8 million people were registered to vote in the 8 June election, 500,000 higher than in 2015 and also more than the 46.4 million figure for the EU referendum. Of these, 68.7% actually voted on the day, the highest turnout figure for a general election since 1997. There was a surge in applications to register to the vote in the days after Theresa May called the snap poll on 18 April and also in the days leading up to the 22 May deadline. In total, 2.9 million applications were received over the six-week period. Several constituencies found that the size of their electorate rose by more than 10%, including seats with large student populations such as Canterbury, Cambridge, Bristol West and Leeds Central. However, concerns over the number of duplicate applications - a problem which initially surfaced after last year's EU referendum - continue to persist. At the moment, there is no direct link between electoral registers, which are held and managed by electoral registration officials around Britain, and the online registration service now used by a majority of people. The two systems use different databases and cannot communicate directly with each other. Between 1 December 2016 and the 22 May deadline, about 4.9 million applications to vote were submitted, the majority of them done online. But the net increase in the number of entries on the electoral register during that period was only 1.4 million, suggesting "a significant proportion of applications are likely to have been duplicates". With no way of people checking online whether they are already registered, the proportion of duplicate applications is estimated to have ranged between 30% and 70% in different areas. The watchdog said this had caused significant administration and financial burdens for electoral officials and should be addressed by clearer information on registration sites, including potentially a verification function which it said was used in Australia, New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland. Despite efforts to flag up to people that they did not need to register if they had been sent a poll card or had voted in May's local council elections, the watchdog said it appeared to have made little difference and urgent action was now needed. "The relative ease of submitting an application to register to vote using the online service, in comparison to the difficult of contacting a local authority electoral services team by telephone or email to check if they were already registered, meant many people simply submitted another application," the report said. Although there was a lack of evidence to back up claims on social media that some people had voted twice, the watchdog said it took the issue very seriously and anyone with information should contact the police. It stressed that although some people - including students and those with second homes - may lawfully be able to register in more than one constituency and cast more than one vote in local elections, voting twice in a general election was an offence punishable by an unlimited fine. The "dispersed and unconnected" nature of the 381 electoral registers in Britain means it is not possible to collectively cross-check entries, the watchdog said, and being able to do so would significantly reduce the risk of double voting. It is also calling for people who are registered in two seats to choose in advance which one they will vote in at future general elections. Labour's shadow minister for voter engagement, Cat Smith, said voting twice was a serious offence and police needed to have the resources to prosecute people suspected of doing so. But she warned against a knee-jerk reaction, given the rise in registration and turnout, particularly among younger voters. "A blanket ban on being registered at two addresses would exclude those who for reasons of work or study need to be registered in two places," she said. "This cannot be an attempt to make it harder for young people and students to register to vote."	Reports of people voting more than once in June's election are "troubling" but there is little evidence of widespread abuse, the elections watchdog has said.
Well perhaps it is. It certainly took the commodities markets (and me) rather by surprise when it agreed to cut production at a meeting in Algiers. In fact the group has a lot of work to do before it has a real and sustained impact on the price. But that decision was not what the market expected. Traders thought the result would be more disarray, as there was at a meeting of Opec and some other oil exporters in Doha back in April. This time they did manage to make progress. The context for the Algiers decision - and the unsuccessful attempts to agree action before - is crude oil prices are less than half what they were in June 2014. That hurts Opec member countries. Government finances and economic performance have taken a substantial hit. In Saudi Arabia for example, the government's finances were in surplus to the tune of 12% of annual income (GDP) in 2012. Last year there was a deficit of 16%. Angola's economy grew 7% in 2013. Last year it was 3%. Venezuela's figures are much worse, though it's far from being entirely due to the lower price of oil. That has however severely aggravated the economic damage done by the country's political crisis. Opec member countries have felt this financial pain with increasing intensity for almost two years now. Opec doesn't account for the whole market by a long way. There are very large oil producers that are not members, notably the United States, Russia, China and Canada.  But the group, which currently has about 40% of the global market can move it by cutting production - and it does have a history of responding to low oil prices, by cutting production. In the past Saudi Arabia, the group's biggest player, has often led the effort. This time the situation was complicated by Iran's emergence earlier this year from international sanctions over its nuclear programme. Tehran was determined to take advantage and sought to recover its share of the market. For Opec, the trouble was that Saudi Arabia was unwilling to curb production without Iran doing likewise, a position also underpinned by the longstanding geopolitical tension between the two countries which are the leading powers in the Gulf. That tension was the reason for the failure in Doha in April. Things seem to have changed. Iran has boosted oil production already. It could go higher, but not as easily as was the case in the immediate aftermath of the lifting of sanctions.  Saudi Arabia has softened its position. The oil minister Khalid al-Falih, who was appointed after the Doha meeting, is reported to have said in Algiers that Iran, as well Nigeria and Libya would be allowed to produce "at maximum levels that make sense". The secretary general of the group, Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, told the BBC that those three countries "have lost a considerable volume of their production due to unfortunate circumstances". He said "they will be treated differently." It also appeared to be the case for some time after the price fall began in 2014 that Saudi Arabia was willing to tolerate the situation because of the pressure it put on competitors, especially shale oil producers in the United States. The rise of this sector over the last decade or so is seen as a key factor behind the plentiful supply of oil that partly drove the price fall. Some shale operators have cut back, but overall oil production in the US in 2015 was higher despite the lower prices.  If the Saudi aim was to squeeze the American industry, they have not had anything like the success they hoped for. It does look as though the Saudis have decided they need a new strategy. So Opec agrees they want to take action to push prices up. The detail will be difficult to negotiate. How will they allocate the production cuts between members? How differently will Iran, Nigeria and Libya be treated? And what baseline level of production will they use in calculating new production ceilings? It's also likely they will want some non-members to co-operate. The US and Canada won't. They don't believe in the kind of market management that Opec is trying to achieve and in any case oil production is done in those countries by private businesses which will not take orders from energy ministers. Russia, however, might be willing to come on board and did discuss the possibility at the Doha meeting. And then with Opec there is always the question of whether member countries will comply with any agreed limits on their own production. The reaction of the oil market to the Algiers agreement is telling. The price of crude oil rose and then fell back. It remains very much within the range that it has been trading in for the last six months.  In short it looks like the market view is that something has changed at Opec, but traders will need to see Opec filling in all the details of an agreement before they are convinced that prices really are heading upwards.	Opec, the oil producers' group is back in the driving seat.

The NHS spent £8.84m on private ambulances in the capital last year compared to £795,000 in 2011, according to Freedom of Information data. The London Ambulance Service (LAS) conceded it was losing staff due to "pressure on the organisation". But LAS denied claims it had employed private staff previously sacked by the NHS. Heidi Alexander, Labour MP for Lewisham East, claimed London ambulances were taking "on average two minutes longer than three years ago" to respond to the most serious call-outs. Labour said its research discovered private ambulance usage by ambulance trusts across the country grew by 82% between financial years 2011/12 and 2013/14, from £37m to £67.5m last year. Private ambulance spending In Yorkshire and the North East more than quadrupled to hit £3.56m and £2.9m respectively, said Labour, although other ambulance services maintained low spending during the two years, while one trust reduced its reliance on private vehicles. Shadow health minister Jamie Reed raised concerns over the figures and the "increasing use" of private ambulances during health questions in the House of Commons. But his comments were branded "absolute nonsense" by public health minister Jane Ellison, who said that previous Labour government "occasionally deployed private ambulances too". Brendan Kemp, regional organiser for the GMB union, questioned the hiring practices of ambulance trusts and their ability to keep staff. "Who's checking the qualifications of the staff that man these vehicles?" he said on BBC London 94.9. "Often staff that have been dismissed by London Ambulance Service for something, often they'll reappear working for a private contractor." But Jason Killens, director of operations for the LAS, said every private contractor "is checked by us before we use them". "Staff that leave the LAS for reasons of clinical safety would not be redeployed on those private contracts with us," he told BBC London 94.9. Mr Killens said increasing demand each year "is adding pressure in the organisation" and conceded that "some staff leave" as a result, with about 500 vacancies currently unfilled. He added: "There is a small number that leave us and go and work in the private sector, but the vast majority of people that leave the ambulance service in London go to work elsewhere in the NHS."	Spending on private ambulances in London grew by 1,000% between 2011 and 2013, the Labour party has claimed.
It was back in 2008, and James Watt and Martin Dickie's then tiny brewery at Fraserburgh, north-east Scotland, was little over a year old and struggling. Selling their US-style craft beers from the back of their van at farmers' markets, they were missing payments on their £20,000 ($30,000) bank loan. "We were selling a couple of cases on a good day, and losing money," says Mr Watt, now 32. And then they decided to enter a bottled beer competition organised by supermarket group Tesco. BrewDog won first, second, third, and fourth place. "So we went down to Tesco's headquarters [just north of London], and they told us they loved our beer and wanted to put us in 500 shops, buying 2,000 cases a week," says Mr Watt. "We put on our best poker faces and said 'no problem'. Yet we were just two guys filling bottles by hand." With Tesco wanting first deliveries in four months' time, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie, also now 32, went to their bank to ask for another £150,000, so they could quickly install a bottling line, and expand production. But failing to meet the payments on their existing loan, the bank said a firm "no". So the business partners went to another lender, and lied. Mr Watt says: "We said that our bank had offered us an amazing deal, but that if you can match it we'll switch, and they went for it. You have got to do what you have to do." With BrewDog now being able to increase its brewing facilities, it was able to start supplying Tesco on time with bottles of its Punk IPA. The beer was an immediate hit, and the other UK supermarkets soon followed suit. Fast forward to 2014, and BrewDog is due to see its turnover top £32m this year. It employs 357 people, and as well as continuing to supply the likes of Tesco UK-wide, it owns 25 bars, 18 across the UK, and seven abroad. And now based at a larger brewery down the road in the town of Ellon, it exports to 52 countries. Childhood friends who grew up in the Scottish town of Peterhead, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie started brewing beer together as a hobby in their early 20s. At the time Mr Watt was working as a deep sea fisherman, while Mr Dickie was a whisky distiller. From the very start they were inspired to brew American-style craft beers - sweet-tasting ales with high alcohol levels and very large amounts of US hops, which gave them a bold, fruity, even perfumed flavour. They are very Marmite beers in that you either love them or hate them. To fans they are flavoursome and interesting, to critics they are undrinkable. Yet, confident they could convert drinkers, and after some good reviews, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie decided to quit their day jobs and start brewing professionally in 2007. "Even though the first year was tough, we never lost faith in what we were doing," says Mr Watt. "We were hell-bent... we were stupidly ambitious." In addition to the bold flavours, the two men also worked hard on creating an irreverent brand image for BrewDog, giving their beers fun names, and bright, colourful labels. Some of their other brews are called Dead Pony Pale Ale, Dogma and Hardcore IPA. Expansion has been made possible after the business raised £7m via crowdfunding, with 15,000 people paying £95 for a stake in the company. In return they get discounts in BrewDog's bars, and other perks. In more controversial matters, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie have also regularly - and enthusiastically - attacked regulators and industry bodies. Their critics say they do so simply to garner publicity, but Mr Watt says they are merely sticking up for themselves. Earlier this year the Portman Group, the UK drinks industry trade body that promotes responsible drinking, criticised BrewDog, saying that the label of the brewery's Dead Pony Pale Ale promoted anti-social behaviour and binge drinking. BrewDog's response at the time was as follows: "Unfortunately, the Portman Group is a gloomy gaggle of killjoy jobsworths, funded by navel-gazing international drinks giants." When contacted by the BBC for this article, a spokesman for the Portman Group said: "BrewDog's business model has traditionally used complaints by the public as a PR opportunity for their brands. "BrewDog and the Portman Group have a long history... we don't expect them to like us, but we were pleased to see they have started relabeling their products." There are no hard and fast rules on what makes a "craft beer". However, typically it is a natural beer made by a small brewery, often with large amounts of pungent hops and a marked sweetness from the barley malt So what is the difference between "craft beer" and "real ale"? Unlike craft beer, real ale - as determined by UK pressure group Campaign For Real Ale - has to be unpasteurised and unfiltered. Real ale also more often has a drier flavour. Craft beer is also typically served well chilled and carbonated, whereas real ales are served less cold and have no added gas Yet, like lager (which itself can be a craft beer or real ale), they share the same basic four ingredients - malted barley, hops, yeast and water. In all cases other ingredients can be added on top, such as different grains A similar dispute that BrewDog had in 2013 with the UK's advertising watchdog, the ASA, saw Mr Watt call the officials "killjoy, self-important pen pushers". BrewDog has also been criticised for selling some beers with exceptionally high alcohol rates, such as a limited edition ale that was 55% alcohol. Mr Watt says that he and Mr Dickie - who together own a 75% share of the business - remain unrepentant, and simply "make beers that we want to drink ourselves". Mr Watt adds that BrewDog's products are bought by beer aficionados, and priced at a premium. He says that if someone is going to abuse alcohol they will be the cheaper, mass market beers that give drinkers "maximum bang for their buck". With exports now making up 65% of sales, Mr Watt says they have no plans to slow down the fast-paced growth. "My worry is that we aren't growing fast enough," he says.	When the founders of popular but controversial beer company BrewDog needed a second bank loan to enable them to expand production, their tactic was a simple one - lie through their teeth.
The boy had lived with the twin in his stomach his whole life, but went to hospital after complaining of pain. His mother told Bernama the foetus "was formed with organs like those of a baby". It is believed to be the first reported case of the condition, known medically as "fetus in fetu", in Malaysia. The boy's mother, 38, said funeral rites had been performed on the foetus and it was buried at a local cemetery. Reports said the foetus had legs, hands and genitals. "Only the nose and mouth were not complete," she said, saying she had accepted his fate. The teenager had been admitted to a local district hospital before being referred to the Sultan Abdul Hamid Hospital in Kedah for the operation to remove the twin. The hospital and Malaysia's government health officials would not comment on the case to the BBC. What is fetus in fetu? Dr S Raman, obstetrics and gynaecology specialist at Pantai Hospital in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, told the BBC it is when an "additional twin gets absorbed into the body of the living twin". "It's almost like a vanishing twin, or sometimes called a parasitic twin," he said. "I have actually seen a case of the foetus being attached to the outside of the living twin, so it's possible for the twin to be both inside or outside the body." There have also been cases of two twins found inside the abdomen of one child, in the case of a triplet pregnancy. What causes it? There is no known trigger, but it occurs in the early stages of development when one foetus wraps around the other. The enveloped twin then does not fully form but becomes a "parasite", relying on their host twin for their survival. Such twins usually die before birth. The abnormality is estimated to occur in 1 in 500,000 live births. Is it unusual to live so long with the twin? One widely reported case was of a 36-year-old man in India whose tumour had grown so big that he was having difficulty breathing. In villages or smaller towns where access to medical facilities are limited, it is possible for someone to not know they have a foetus and live with it their entire life, says Dr Raman. The abnormality is easily spotted if a baby undergoes an ultrasound or CT scan, and there have been cases of babies as young as three months old being operated on.	A 15-year-old Malaysian boy has had the parasitic foetus of his twin removed from his stomach, Malaysia's Bernama state news agency reports.
The figures come ahead of Wednesday's AGM where investors will quiz management over their plans for the Hinkley Point nuclear plant in the UK. EDF, 85% controlled by the French state, has struggled to find the cash for its 66.5% stake in the project. In April it pushed a final decision on the £18bn plant back to September. Chief financial officer Thomas Piquemal resigned in April following an internal disagreement over whether to press on with the controversial project. However, EDF has outlined plans to raise €4bn, with up to €3bn provided by the French government. Credit rating agencies are due to assess the group in the coming days and their verdict on its finances will determine how easy it will be for the group to raise cash. Meanwhile, tough market conditions mean EDF is cutting costs and planning to sell €10bn in assets by 2020, including a stake in French power-grid operator RTE. On Tuesday the new chief financial office Xavier Girre, said the management was not considering spinning off any part of the group to raise money. Its latest earnings report shows it has reduced its target for 2016 nuclear output to 408-412 terawatt-hour from 410-415. The scaling down of its output reflects continuing problems at its Paluel nuclear facility in France where a steam generator collapsed during maintenance. Sales fell 7% to €21.4bn in the first three months of the year, with sales in the UK down 9.8%. The company said its earnings forecast for 2016 remained on track.	French energy giant EDF says sales fell 7% in the first three months of the year in the face of stiff competition, a mild winter and lower energy prices.
Stuart Hamilton, 37, was last seen by his friends and family two weeks ago. Hamilton, from Gorgie in Edinburgh, was seen on CCTV at Haymarket Station on Sunday at 10:16. He then travelled by train to Manchester. He was then spotted by a former colleague near Buckingham Palace in London on Tuesday at 13:30. Mr Hamilton is white and of medium build. He is about 6ft 2in with short, dark, receding hair. He was last seen wearing a blue top along with a black hooded top, blue jeans and white trainers. He was also carrying a dark rucksack. Police Scotland has been working with Greater Manchester Police and the Metropolitan Police Service. Insp Jonathan Elliot, of Police Station, said:  "We are continuing our search for Stuart, which has now moved to London. "Anyone who knows Stuart's whereabouts in either Edinburgh, Manchester or London, or recognises his description, is asked to contact police immediately."	A missing man last spotted on CCTV footage taken at an Edinburgh train station has now been seen in central London.

Leicester City are set to sign Caen midfielder N'Golo Kante for an undisclosed fee after he passed a medical at the Premier League club.
A urine sample showed the Australian, who rode at Royal Ascot last week, had the appetite suppressant Phentermine in her system when tested on 11 June. The sample was provided by Payne, 31, at the Swan Hill Cup meeting in Victoria. Racing Victoria stewards in Australia will hold an inquiry on Thursday. Payne has only just returned to Australia after she rode Kaspersky into fifth place in the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot on 20 June. She was advised of the test findings and stood down from riding in races and trackwork by stewards on 23 June. Payne made history in 2015 when she became the first female jockey to win the Melbourne Cup with Prince Of Penzance. After her victory, she made headlines with her comment:  "I want to say to everyone else, get stuffed, because women can do anything and we can beat the world." Her life story is being made into a film, produced and directed by actress Rachel Griffiths, who starred in Muriel's Wedding and Six Feet Under. Payne made her Royal Ascot debut last week after serious injury ruled her out of the previous year's meeting. She required surgery on her pancreas following a fall in May 2016 and spent a month in hospital.	Michelle Payne, the only female jockey to win the Melbourne Cup, has been stood down from riding after testing positive for a banned substance.
He set up a security agency, bringing together counter-terrorism and domestic intelligence under the authority of a single body. The king also replaced the head of the royal guard, and made several appointments to the team of his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. In June, the 31-year-old prince became the first in line to the Saudi throne. He replaced the king's nephew, Mohammed bin Nayef, 57, who pledged allegiance to the younger cousin. The latest changes were announced in Thursday's decrees, published by the state-run SPA news agency. It said the decisions were made in order to maintain "the highest readiness levels to keep up with the latest developments". The new security agency is now headed by Abdulaziz bin Mohammed al-Howairini, a general who will be reporting directly to the 81-year-old king. Previously, the interior ministry was in charge of counter-terrorism and domestic intelligence. The new boss of the royal guard is Gen Suheil al-Mutiri, replacing Gen Hamad al-Awhaly. As part of the overhaul, King Salman also named Mohammed el-Kuwaiz as head of the agency that regulates investments in the oil-rich country.	Saudi Arabia's King Salman has issued a series of royal decrees, marking a new shake-up of top officials.
The law, which is set to become a world first, aims to close the wage gap between men and women. Companies face auditing and possible fines if they do not comply. Iceland was ranked first in the World Economic Forum's 2015 Global Gender Gap Index, followed by Norway, Finland and Sweden. However, according to Iceland's statistics for the same year, the unadjusted gender pay gap remained at 17%. The bill, which was presented on Tuesday, is supported by the centre-right coalition government and the opposition. Applying to both the public and private sector, it would prohibit any discrimination not just on gender, but also on race, religion, disability, occupational disability, age and sexual orientation grounds. "The bill entails that companies and institutions of a certain size, 25 or more employees, undertake a certification of their equal-pay programmes," Thorsteinn Viglundsson, the minister of social affairs and equality, told news agency AFP. The bill will now be subject to a series of debates, and if it passes, it will take effect from January 2018. In Iceland's parliament, nearly 50% of lawmakers are women, and a voluntary measure for equal pay across the country was introduced in 2012. However, many still do not think enough is being done. In October, thousands of women left work early and headed out on to the streets of the capital, Reykjavik, to protest against earning less than men. It echoed the 1975 Icelandic women's strike, when women did not go to their paid jobs, or do any housework or child-rearing at home for one day.	Iceland's parliament is examining a bill that would require companies to prove they offer equal pay to employees.
The women had been legally married for a few months after one of them passed as a man in front of an Islamic cleric who presided over their wedding. But suspicious neighbours confronted the couple and reported them to police. The two women are now back with their families, forcibly separated and under surveillance by the Islamic police. The local Sharia police chief told them Islam said they must be beheaded and burned for what they had done. But Aceh, the only province in Indonesia that is allowed to implement Sharia law, has yet to adopt any provisions dealing with gay and lesbian people. The provincial parliament passed Islamic laws authorising the stoning to death of adulterers and the caning of homosexuals in 2009, but the governor has refused to sign it. Homosexuality is frowned upon but legal in Indonesia. Activists have blamed Aceh's Sharia laws for encouraging vigilantism and intolerance, and say they violate the Indonesian constitution.	Islamic police in the Indonesian province of Aceh have forced two women to have their marriage annulled and sign an agreement to separate.
Douglas Carswell also told the BBC's Sunday Politics that the party needed to ensure it got the "tone" right in order to attract more voters. It comes after Mr Carswell said in an article in the Times on Saturday that Mr Farage "needs to take a break now". A bitter internal row has developed within UKIP after Mr Farage's resignation was rejected by the party. Mr Carswell said: "I'm suggesting he takes a break as leader. I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader. "Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. "I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team. "No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future." The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South. He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament. Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of "inexperienced" advisers. UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam. Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had "phenomenal" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party. In his article, Mr Carswell had said that "knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more". "I know that I never could," he added, stressing that he would find it "impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad". However, he said that "even leaders need to take a break", adding: "Nigel needs to take a break now." UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency.	Nigel Farage should take a break "as leader" of UKIP but not a break from being leader, the party's only MP says.
The Californian singer has provided backing vocals for Stevie Wonder, Elton John, Josh Groban, Carole King, Robbie Williams and Rod Stewart in her stellar career. Most famously, she was due to be a featured singer on Michael Jackson's ill-fated This Is It tour in 2009 - and can be seen performing a spine-tingling duet with the star in the posthumous film of the rehearsals. She went on to appear on the US version of The Voice - where her shock elimination prompted judge Adam Levine to declare: "I hate this country". Hill's efforts to launch a solo career were then documented in the Oscar-winning film 20 Feet From Stardom - which turned the spotlight on the (mainly African-American) back-up singers who have propped up rock's biggest stars. But the catalyst for her solo career turned out to be Prince - who read about the star in a newspaper, and invited her to record an album at his Paisley Park Studios in Minneapolis. Hill tells the BBC about their collaboration, her experiences as a backing singer, and the day that Michael Jackson died. What's the first song you remember hearing? Walk With Me by Vanessa Bell Armstrong Who was the first person who told you you could sing? My mother was the first person to tell me I could sing.  She tells the story of how I was singing in the back car seat as a little girl, and she saw that I had talent.  We wrote our first song together when I was four. How did you land a job on Michael Jackson's This Is It tour? I did a small gig in Los Angeles and became friends with some musicians there.  One of them knew Michael's musical director and he invited me to audition. I did a small audition at the vocal director's house and a couple weeks later I was hired.  I remember them telling me, "Michael is on your Myspace page.  Change the picture!"  At the time, I was also hired to work at a clothing shop, so I quit that job and joined the This Is It tour. He was a master of stagecraft - what tips did he give you? Michael was fascinating to watch.  Working with him taught me the importance of seizing every moment on stage.  He painted pictures with every lyric and movement in his body. What do you remember of the day he died? I was sitting at a restaurant when my phone started blowing up.  There were rumours of his death but I didn't believe it.  It wasn't until later that day when this nightmare became a reality as I arrived at the Staples Center for rehearsal.  It was a very tragic day.   They had already begun to collapse the stage and pack up the gear.  Just the night before we were rehearsingâ€¦ It was surreal. What was it like to sing at the memorial service? It was an overwhelming experience. I mean, that was the same stage we rehearsed with him [on] two weeks prior. But it was a beautiful service. You were eliminated from the US version of The Voice - what did that experience teach you? When I was on The Voice, I made discoveries about my vocal style.  No matter what the song was, I always managed to turn it into a soul song whether I wanted to or not.  I learned that at the heart of it, I'm a soul singer.  My roots run deep, starting from the early days of jamming with my parents on Sly and the Family Stone and Curtis Mayfield songs. What difference did 20 Feet From Stardom make to your career? 20 Feet From Stardom was a special project that resonated with so many people.  We were honoured with an Oscar and Grammy and many wonderful opportunities have come my way because of it.   People were inspired by the stories in the film and they continue to follow my story to see what happens next. How much of a struggle was it to make the leap to solo artist? It's a very rough road - that 20 feet from being a backing singer to an artist is a long 20 feet! But what keeps me going is a passion for music. No matter what, it makes me happy to do it. What's the biggest difference between working as a backing vocalist and fronting your own material? Working as a backing singer is being a part of a group effort to give the artist what they need.  It's a fun community to be a part of.  Being a solo artist is a totally different experience.  There is more responsibility and pressure, yet it is very rewarding.  I love sitting in the driver's seat, directing everybody to achieve the sound I'm looking for.  There's nothing more fulfilling than making the sounds you hear in your head become a reality. Who's the most demanding artist you've sung for? The most demanding was Natalie Cole.  It was a short show, but she was very particular about how she wanted the vocals.  I have much respect for her.  She kept the singers on their toes! How did you end up working with Prince? I did an interview and was asked who is my dream collaborator.  I said "Prince!"  He saw the interview and personally reached out to me.  I remember receiving the unknown call on my cell phone and freaking out while I was talking to him.  I officially met him at his album listening party in Los Angeles.  Shortly after, he invited me to Paisley Park and that was beginning of the collaboration. He's got a wicked sense of humour... Has he ever caught you out with a prank? He once called me and I didn't recognize his voice because he pretended to be someone else.  He can do great impersonations. What did he contribute to your album? He's a fantastic producer and arranger.  He played many instruments, sang, arranged, and even wrote.  He was very involved in the process, yet it was a great collaboration between his ideas and my ideas.  Most of the songs were already written and he helped me come up with great grooves and effective edits. Why did you call it Back In Time? I wanted people to feel like they have travelled back into a golden era of funk/soul music.  For me, personally, this record celebrates my childhood and upbringing in a musical family.  Many of the lyrics are autobiographical - describing where I came from, my old stomping grounds, and the amazing musical community that inspired me along the way.  The whole record feels like a dusty jam session in the basement of my parents' house. What song means the most to you? Angel In The Dark.  I think about the many times I felt like I was trapped in a dark tunnel, yet God has always managed to rescue me at the right time.  He is that Angel in the dark. Judith Hill's debut album Back In Time is out now on NPG Records.	You may not have heard of Judith Hill, but you've almost certainly heard her voice.
The original game was postponed on 26 November because of a frozen pitch. The offer from the Latics is for both home and away supporters visiting SportsDirect.com Park. Oldham, who are next to bottom of the table, three points from safety, have just exited a transfer embargo and reappointed John Sheridan as manager. "We want as many supporters to welcome back the manager to the football club as he takes his place on the sidelines for the first time," said a club statement. Supporters are, however, being invited to make a donation to a local charity. Brentford were the first team to offer free entry for a league game in England when they played Peterborough in 2001.	Oldham Athletic have offered free entry to all fans for their rearranged League One fixture against Peterborough United on Tuesday, 24 January.
Yet again, you feel for the families of those killed on board, and the people that actually survived the ordeal. It seems never ending. In less than a year two Malaysian aircraft have been lost, with 537 people on board. The AirAsia accident - en route to Singapore in December - killed 162. It is not just the accidents. It's the fact that whole aircraft are going down without warning. You would be forgiven for thinking that flying is becoming more lethal. But you would be wrong. In fact, when you look at the number of crashes and fatalities compared to the huge number of people flying today (3.2 billion passengers last year), we are in a golden era of aircraft safety. According to safety analysts Ascend, 2014 was narrowly the safest year ever, with one fatal accident per 2.38 million flights, compared to every 1.91 million flights the year before. It must be noted that that does not include the loss of the Malaysian airliner over Ukraine, where 298 people died, which they count as a war loss rather than an accident. But even with that flight added it is not a terrible year, historically. Another respected organisation, the Aviation Safety Network, registers 21 fatal accidents in 2014 (this time including Ukraine), compared to 29 in 2013 and 23 the year before that. Nearly 1,000 people died in 2014, which is 700 more than the year before. Horrible numbers, but compare that to the worst year, 1972, when 2,370 passengers were killed - and far fewer people were flying then, maybe a quarter of the number travelling today. So why is flying getting safer? Well, technology. "Think of your car in the 1970s", David Learmount, from Flightglobal tells me. "The brakes, the handling, the lack of safety features. Well, aircraft are exactly the same. "We knew most things about aerodynamics by the 1940s. What has changed is the technology." Every new generation of aircraft has been safer than the one before. Better computers, design, materials. But there is another sobering factor at play here too. Every tragedy has taught designers something new. Go back a couple of decades and the biggest killer was something called Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT). A benign name with a morbid outcome, it normally involved a perfectly serviceable aircraft coming into land, then hitting something on the ground without the crew even knowing it was there. Many airports are near hills. Then along came a piece of equipment that was to transform safety: the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System. "It's like a sat nav that can help you thread your way through hills and mountains, even in clouds", David says. Here is another example of how disaster has led to safer flying. In 1985 a British Airtours aircraft was taking off from Manchester Airport, en route to Corfu. The pilots aborted at the last minute because one of the engines failed, but the aircraft was also on fire. Fifty-four people died fleeing the smoke, the aisles were jammed with passengers panicking to get out. Next time you fly, look at the floor. You will probably see strip lights along both sides of the aisle, then they turn and lead to each exit. That idea comes straight from the Manchester fire. The lights mean passengers can find the exit, even crawling on their hands and knees through thick smoke. "Our founder was actually working on emergency guide lights to help people escape from nuclear power stations and submarines," says Nigel Duncan, boss of STG aerospace. "This accident made him realise they could be used in planes too". Nigel's company now supplies guiding lights for the floors of 9,000 airliners. They are photoluminescent, "which means they are fail-safe". "It's a chemical process so they don't need power -  sever it and it still works," he says. For the most part, computers fly modern airliners. And they are very good at it. But all of this safety-driven automation has led to a new safety concern that is uncomfortable to hear. Pilots don't get enough practice at actually flying planes. The computer has taken them out of the loop. Six years ago, Air France flight 447 crashed into the Atlantic, killing 228 people. Yet there was nothing critically wrong with the plane. So why did it crash? Well, the weather was bad and a small tube froze up, knocking out the speed indicator. The actual speed was fine, but the speed data on their screens was all over the place. Suddenly, the computer didn't know how fast it was going, and it handed control back to the pilots. Confused, in bad weather, in darkness and taken by surprise, they couldn't work out what was happening, so they kept climbing to the point where the aircraft stalled, effectively stopping in mid-air and falling from the sky. Unsurprisingly, plenty in the industry want more hands-on training for pilots. "A few years ago the airlines used to get more crew from the military and those guys were used to manually flying aircraft right on the edge", David Learmount tells me. "Today, many pilots don't have that kind of background training." Having said all of that, just bear in mind: Nothing is ever without risk, but the chances of dying in an aircraft "accident" are lower than ever.	Yet again, we are looking at shocking pictures of a plane crash.
The Bath winger, 22, missed matches against France and Wales after injuring his hamstring in January. Head coach Eddie Jones said on Sunday that he was "confident" Watson would feature against Italy. The defending champions have also retained Northampton Saints prop Paul Hill for the week-long training camp. Forwards: Jack Clifford (Harlequins), Dan Cole (Leicester Tigers), Ellis Genge (Leicester Tigers), Jamie George (Saracens), Dylan Hartley (Northampton Saints), James Haskell (Wasps), Paul Hill (Northampton Saints), Nathan Hughes (Wasps), Maro Itoje (Saracens), Joe Launchbury (Wasps), Courtney Lawes (Northampton Saints), Joe Marler (Harlequins) , Kyle Sinckler (Harlequins), Tom Wood (Northampton Saints). Backs: Mike Brown (Harlequins), Danny Care (Harlequins), Elliot Daly (Wasps), Owen Farrell (Saracens), George Ford (Bath Rugby), Jonathan Joseph (Bath Rugby), Jonny May (Gloucester Rugby), Jack Nowell (Exeter Chiefs), Ben Te'o (Worcester Warriors), Anthony Watson (Bath Rugby), Ben Youngs (Leicester Tigers).	Anthony Watson has been included in England's 25-man training squad for their Six Nations game against Italy on 26 February.
Media playback is not supported on this device Jean-Marc Bosman did not trademark any moments of skill, score famous late winners or carry his teams to success but he was good enough to win 20 youth caps for Belgium and break into the first team of one of his country's best clubs at 18. That, however, is not what earns him a place alongside Charlemagne, Audrey Hepburn and Hercule Poirot in a list of famous Belgians. Twenty years ago on Tuesday, Bosman emerged from the European Court of Justice with a win that turned Europe's top divisions into glorious expressions of multiculturalism and added a new noun to sport's lexicon: the Bosman. From that moment, players at the end of their contracts - David Beckham, Sol Campbell, Steve McManaman and many more - could move without a transfer fee. No longer would a player from the European Union have their opportunities in the single market curtailed by rules limiting the number of foreigners clubs could field. But for this softly spoken 51 year old, it was a case that almost ruined him. "There have been real problems but I am feeling much better now," said Bosman when I asked him how he was after a spell in prison, bankruptcy and a long battle with alcoholism. "I've had medical and psychological care and I also have blood samples taken on a regular basis. "There have been difficulties and my financial situation is not easy but life has started over. I have regained strength and feel motivated. "It has not been easy to find work after the ruling but I am not complaining. The tunnel is nearing its end." He entered that tunnel in 1990 when his contract with RFC Liege expired. With the club in financial trouble they wanted the midfielder to sign a new deal on a quarter of his former salary. Yet when Dunkerque, across the border in France, wanted to buy him, Liege demanded four times what they'd paid for him in the first place. "It was illogical," said Bosman, explaining the moment he decided to become a "freedom fighter". His lawyer thought it would take two weeks. It took five years; a period that should have been the best years of a decent career. Banned in Belgium, Bosman moved to a second division club in France, only for them to go bust. Other clubs told him they would like to sign him but could not because they already had three foreigners. He had a brief spell on the island of La Reunion and another go in the Belgian leagues, but it is an understatement to say his decision to take football's business model to court made him less attractive to club chairmen. Broke, tired and out of shape, he accepted 350,000 Swiss francs in damages for his legal victory and began a life after football that he is still trying to work out. There was a disastrous investment in a t-shirt business (he had hoped grateful footballers would buy one, only his lawyer's son did so) and problems with the taxman. In 2011, he was convicted of assault following claims he had been involved in an argument with his girlfriend after he asked her daughter to get him some booze.  Initially, the courts were lenient but when he failed to pay his fine they were left with little choice. He was sentenced to a year in prison in 2013. It was then that Fifpro, the international trade union for footballers, stepped in. The stars he had helped become multi-millionaires may have forgotten him but his union did not. "I was young and handsome then and I now have become old," he explained. "Most of the players won't be able to recognise me but my case is still being talked about - I think that is positive. "I may not be here in 20 years' time but they will still be talking about it and if someone remembers me I will give him my bank details. Everyone benefited from the Bosman ruling except me!" I am speaking to him at Fifpro's swish headquarters in a suburb of Amsterdam. Bosman has become a spokesman for the organisation's campaign to finish what he started: scrap transfer fees entirely. The best way to understand this is to view Bosman as a battle in a 125-year war between clubs and players. The players won Bosman but were "ambushed", in the words of Fifpro's general secretary Theo van Seggelen, six years later. The European Commission made a deal with the game's governing bodies, Uefa and Fifa, to stem what the clubs claimed was rampant "player power". This deal was enshrined in Fifa's Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players in 2001. These rules set out today's transfer system - windows - the concept of a protected period when a contract cannot be broken, maximum and minimum contract lengths and so on - and for Fifpro they amount to the pendulum swinging towards the clubs. Five years later, a row about Scottish defender Andy Webster's move from Hearts to Wigan Athletic saw that pendulum swing back. The details of the case are convoluted but the final ruling seemed to fix what compensation a player/new employer should pay the old employer for breaking a contract outside of the protected period. This sum would be the wages the player would earn if he stayed. This really could have been revolutionary but two years later the Court of Arbitration for Sport changed the compensation equation by adding pro rata slices of the initial transfer fee and an estimate of the player's replacement cost. Players such Andrea Pirlo or Robert Lewandowski could still let their contracts expire to get Bosman moves to new teams and bigger wages. But clubs wanting to sign players still under contract, even outside the protected period, would have to cough up some compensation, as Manchester City did with Raheem Sterling last summer. Quite right too, is the usual response to this compromise between a player's right to ply his trade on the one hand, and a club's right to stability and a league's competitive integrity on the other. Everton manager Roberto Martinez, the first Spanish player to get a Bosman to England, has criticised the transfer window, but does not want to scrap compensation. "The Bosman ruling was a huge shock at the time but I used it and it now seems a normal way to move freely," said Martinez last week. "Football has benefited from the multicultural input of players and it seems normal now. "But it wouldn't be right to scrap transfer fees. The value of a footballer is important and the value of developing players is important." But Fifpro's Van Seggelen says this view is based on a misunderstanding of the players' position, as well as being unfounded in truth. Dr Stefan Szymanski, author of the best-selling Soccernomics and professor of sports management at the University of Michigan, did some research for Fifpro earlier this year which outlined how the system was failing to do any of the things it promised in 2001. According to Szymanski, the settlement has led to the rich clubs getting richer as more than half of all transfer spending circulates among them, with little trickling down the pyramid, far less than is syphoned off by agents. He also outlined how the same clubs and leagues keep winning, while the same types of clubs and leagues keep failing, leaving themselves, he says, vulnerable to match-fixing, third-party ownership and the trafficking of minors. "We thought the transfer system was finished on 15 December, 1995, but of course it isn't," explained Van Seggelen. "In fact, the situation is even worse than before. I often say to people 'how would you feel if you had to wait three months for your salary?' "You also have players waiting years for justice through the tribunal system, and even when he has a positive decision there is no enforcement system. We cannot accept that." That might win over a few more voters on the terraces but there will still be many in the "Bosman ruined football" camp who think this is simply a union fighting for more money for its members, and in this case the members are loaded. "Only 1% of our members are financially independent, so not every player is making that kind of money," said Van Seggelen. "We're not trying to make them richer. In an ideal world, every player would play at the level they belong. "I don't know why the clubs are so nervous. We are not trying to kill the top clubs or leagues. "Sport is unusual but it must be reasonable. It's an economic activity, a business, so it must respect the law." By this point, Bosman is outside smoking. Despite arriving late and looking like he could not wait for the interview to end, he was good company. He does not watch much football these days, he cannot afford the television subscriptions, but what he sees he enjoys. His main focus is looking after his two young boys and being a better dad to the grown-up daughter he has from an earlier relationship. "Martin and Samuel are too young to know about my case, I don't want to complicate their lives with it, they've just left kindergarten," he said. "But I think later, when they grow up, they could find out about what their dad has done for professional players on the internet and they will see their dad has done something good. "Back then clubs were selling hens, horses, mules and pigs, but not humans. "Players should be considered as workers, full stop, that's it! This is the Bosman ruling, and we ought to get back to it."	A Cruyff turn, Fergie time, the Matthews final: football's icons have often entered the language of the sport but can any of those greats claim to have changed the game as much as the nervous, middle-aged Belgian sitting in front of me?
The Fire and Rescue Service said they received a call just before 08:30 GMT on Thursday. The man was found dead in an upstairs bedroom, after fire crews arrived at the house in Drumgay Close, in the Kilmacormick area. They wore breathing apparatus and used thermal imaging cameras to locate the occupant. The Fire and Rescue Service are working to establish the cause of the fire.	A man has been found dead after a house fire in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh.
Company Sgt Maj Nelson Carter, 29, was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his bravery in the Battle of the Boar's Head, in which he died on 30 June 1916. A memorial paving stone was unveiled in Eastbourne Pavilion Gardens and at the war memorial in Hailsham High Street. He was educated in Hailsham but lived most of his life in Eastbourne. He was survived by his daughter and wife, who accepted the Victoria Cross on his behalf from King George V. Councillor Pat Hearn, the mayor of Eastbourne, said: "Nelson Carter was a true hero who showed incredible bravery in leading his men under intense fire. "It's very fitting that we honour his memory almost 100 years to the day since his death and that his family and the people of Eastbourne will have the chance to remember him and the sacrifices he made." A plaque commemorating his life can be found on his home at 33 Greys Road, Old Town in Eastbourne. Hailsham mayor, Councillor Nigel Coltman, added that the town was proud to commemorate his "heroic actions and the commemorative stone will provide an enduring legacy for him".	A World War One soldier has been commemorated with the unveiling of two permanent memorials in the East Sussex towns where he lived and was educated.
The 40-year-old took over in 2012 and has guided Leigh to the Championship title in each of the past two years. They won just one game in The Qualifiers in 2015 as they missed out on a place in Super League. "It is with a heavy heart I have decided to resign as coach," said Rowley in a statement. "My reasons for leaving are personal and I will not comment further in public or in private."	Paul Rowley has resigned as Leigh Centurions head coach 10 days before the start of the 2016 Championship season.
The Yomper statue is currently located in front of the Royal Marines Museum at Eastney. The National Museum of the Royal Navy has started consulting over a proposed move to Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. Campaigners insist it is a local memorial to the conflict and "belongs" at Eastney. The Yomper statue was created by Philip Jackson, depicting a royal marine marching across the islands during the 1982 conflict and was unveiled by former prime minister, Lady Thatcher, in 1992. The National Museum of the Royal Navy (NMRN) is planning to relocate the Royal Marines Museum from Eastney to Portsmouth Historic Dockyard as part of a Â£13m lottery funded project and wants to take the statue with it. An online petition against moving the statue has attracted more than 1,800 signatories, saying it was "now considered as our local Falklands War Memorial". Sheila Mackie who set it up said: "The imposing scale of The Yomper needs space and adequate distance to be fully appreciated, and the visualization of the part in the major campaign that the statue represents couldn't be achieved in an interior space." Conservative-led Portsmouth City Council also voted to express a "clear preference" that the statue remain where it it is. Its motion stated: "The Yomper statue has graced the seafront for many years, serving as a reminder of both the Falklands War and of the Marines' historical association with Eastney." NMRN director Jon Rawlinson said the new museum site would potentially have 750,000 visitors a year, compared to 40,000 at the current museum. "He would be seen by far more people at the historic dockyard, but of course he was built for here [Eastney] and is part of here. " He said no decision had been made and it would consider all comments submitted to its public consultation.	Plans to move a statue depicting a Royal Marine in the Falklands conflict away from Portsmouth seafront have been criticised.
Ross, 39, has agreed a deal that runs initially until the summer of 2016. The former St Mirren defender has coaching experience from stints at Dumbarton and Hearts, where he departed in October. Ross will be in the dugout for Saturday's home match against the Buddies. Alloa are bottom of the Championship, three points adrift of Livingston, who they beat 1-0 on Saturday.	Scottish Championship strugglers Alloa Athletic have appointed Jack Ross as their new manager following the resignation of Danny Lennon.
According to the corporation, "the extended Ten will give audiences even more news analysis and explanation". With additional news from the Nations and Regions, the programme will be 45-minutes long from Monday through to Thursday, starting from 11 January. The move follows a five-month trial in the run-up to the General Election. "Along with its sister programme at 6, The BBC's 10 o'clock News is already the most popular news bulletin in the UK and, in the New Year, it will offer even more," said Gavin Allen, controller of daily news programmes. "Viewers will continue to see the fullest range of stories - and now we'll have still more scope to explain the events that impact the country and help to make sense of the changing world around us." It's always been a bit odd that the BBC's highest profile news bulletin (if not highest rated - the audience for the Six o'clock News is bigger) has also been the shortest. Of course, the official duration hasn't always been stuck to. People who tune in just for the weather at the end of the bulletin will already know this - the news is sometimes two, three or even five minutes longer than it says on the schedules. It is, though, an interesting symbolic move. ITV's News at Ten presenter Tom Bradby has questioned the BBC scheduling its main news at 10pm, and so too has the culture secretary John Whittingdale. This certainly makes clear the BBC isn't planning on vacating the spot, but is digging in even deeper. Yet it does present a quandary for those who like to tuck in to Newsnight after the Ten.  Newsnight's start time is usually around 22:32. In future, if you stay with the News at Ten until the end of the weather, you will have missed the first 13 minutes of the programme. And finally, for fans of the red chair and the celebrity sofa, this is a Monday to Thursday-only change. Question Time on Thursday can be shunted, but Graham Norton, it appears, is sticking to his 22:35 slot.	The BBC's News at Ten is to run 10 minutes longer in the New Year, with the bulletin set to end at 22:45 GMT on every weekday except Friday.
Two armed men wearing masks broke into the 44-year-old victim's house in Meadowbank Terrace at about 00:50. During the assault the men knocked the victim to the ground and hit him repeatedly with a blunt object before fleeing the property. Police Scotland have appealed for witnesses. The first attacker was white with a pale complexion, in his early 20s, 5ft 10ins tall and had dark hair growth on his face, brown eyes and dark unkempt hair. He was of skinny build and was wearing a light grey cotton zip-up tracksuit with the hood up, grey gloves, white Reebok classics-style trainers with air holes and a grey scarf. The second attacker is in his early to mid 20s, between 5ft 6ins and 5ft 8ins tall and of skinny build. He spoke with a local accent. He was wearing an old, black, waist-length outdoor jacket with a dark scarf covering his face and his hood up. He was wearing dark gloves. Det Insp Alan O' Brien, of Police Scotland, said "This is a particularly vicious attack on a disabled man in his own home and we would ask anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the Meadowbank Terrace area in the early hours of Monday morning is asked to contact police immediately. "In addition, anyone with any information that can help us with our inquiries and assist in tracing the men responsible should also get in touch."	A disabled man has been left with serious injuries after being attacked in his own home in Edinburgh.
Under a law aimed at reducing prison overcrowding, senior citizens (Mr Berlusconi is 77) convicted of certain crimes can choose between house arrest and performing some socially useful task. Ordinary criminals can be assigned by the courts to work in centres for drug addicts, or soup kitchens for the homeless, or looking after the elderly. But Mr Berlusconi is no ordinary criminal. He normally travels surrounded by a cohort of bodyguards - which might slightly impede any voluntary work he undertakes. He and his media companies also employ a small army of lawyers. Notwithstanding his final conviction by Italy's highest criminal court, the former prime minister still maintains that he is the innocent victim of politically biased judges. Nonetheless, he still faces a possible ban on holding public office, and later this month will almost certainly be stripped of his seat in the Senate. He was due to begin serving his sentence this week, but bureaucratic delays in the Italian judiciary are legendary. It now appears that no decision will be made by the authorities for at least six months as to how he is to pay off his debt to society. The media mogul can propose what organisation he would like to join, but there is no guarantee that he will be assigned to the charity or the soup kitchen of his choice. The Italian media has had a field day reporting serious, and less-than-serious, offers. A street circus in Naples offered him a chance to go on stage and tell his own jokes. Mr Berlusconi loves to entertain his friends in private with songs, and with jokes that are sometimes notoriously off-colour. He began life as a crooner on board a cruise ship and he has written lyrics for his own songs composed and recorded by his close friend Mariano Apicella, a Neapolitan entertainer. A human rights group suggested that Mr Berlusconi could help them lobby international organisations for the abolition of the death penalty in countries where criminals are still executed. A city in the north offered Mr Berlusconi a desk and an office to counsel business owners suffering from the economic recession. Gino Strada, founder of Emergency, an Italian humanitarian organisation that provides medical services in war zones, including Afghanistan and Sudan, said Mr Berlusconi would be welcome to offer his services to them - although he added that perhaps they would keep him away from their accounts department. Meanwhile, a new way out for Mr Berlusconi has appeared on the horizon. President Giorgio Napolitano is urging the government to pass a new amnesty law aimed at reducing the severe overcrowding in Italy's prisons, and Mr Berlusconi's supporters are hoping that the measure might stretch to cover commuted sentences such as that given to the former prime minister. For now, it is unclear whether the proposed amnesty could cover Mr Berlusconi's community service, and it may be several months before the bill is decided on. Reform minister Gaetano Quagliarello, who belongs to Mr Berlusconi's Freedom Party, says it would be "unthinkable" to exclude him from a measure that applies to all Italian citizens. Justice Minister Anna Maria Cancellieri, on the other hand, said last week she did not think Mr Berlusconi could benefit from the measure.	Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi - whose four-year sentence for tax fraud has been reduced to 12 months under an amnesty - has submitted a formal request to perform a year of community service, instead of being confined to the gilded cage of one of his luxury homes under house arrest.
The fields affected, and another eight associated platforms, produce about 10% of the UK's oil output. Hydrocarbons were detected inside a leg of the Cormorant Alpha platform. Its operator, Taqa Bratani, has removed non-essential workers as a precaution and said the leak had been contained. Shutting down the platform affects the whole Brent pipeline system. The oil leak at Cormorant Alpha was discovered on Monday and non-essential crew were taken off the installation by helicopter. Taqa, also known as Abu Dhabi National Energy, said nothing had leaked into the sea and a technical team was investigating the source. Taqa said on Wednesday afternoon that it was "currently evaluating plans to restore the throughput of an estimated 80,000 barrels per day in the Brent pipeline, excluding any Cormorant Alpha production." A spokesperson said: "This action would occur after thorough technical assurance has established that it can be undertaken safely and without any increased risk." The BBC understands the rest of the Brent pipeline system can no longer operate because Cormorant Alpha, which is situated some 94 miles from Lerwick in Shetland, is a crucial pumping station. Eight other platforms have shut down with up to 27 North Sea fields affected. The Dunlin, Thistle, Northern Producer, Murchison, North Alwyn, Tern, Eider and North Cormorant platforms are also affected. Oil and Gas UK - the offshore industry body - said oil transported through the Brent pipeline system represented 10% of the UK's North Sea oil production. The amount of output affected is 90,000 barrels per day. It is not yet known what potential impact the shut down could have on petrol station prices. However Prof Alex Kemp, an oil economist at the University of Aberdeen, said the closure would have a limited impact on oil prices. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "What we have is an incident which impacts on the Brent pricing system which is used as a marker price for a lot of the world's production. "If it continues one would expect a limited affect on the Brent price. "But the Brent price doesn't just depend on Brent production, it depends on production from a lot of other fields. "The effect should be limited because although the Brent price is the marker for a huge volume of oil in the world market, Brent production constitutes not all that big a proportion of the total." Enterprise Minister Fergus Ewing said: "The Scottish government, including Marine Scotland, are monitoring this situation closely. "No release of hydrocarbons has been reported and all non-essential staff on the platform have been safely removed. "The Health and Safety Executive are investigating and will determine when the pipeline system can be opened again subject to any relevant safety measures being put in place." He said the loss "does not impact security of supply at this time".	A pipeline system servicing up to 27 oil fields has been shut down after a leak on the Cormorant Alpha platform, north-east of Shetland.
The serious case review into events at Winterbourne View, near Bristol, comes after 11 ex-staff members admitted offences against patients. Owners Castlebeck took "financial reward without the responsibility", the report's author Margaret Flynn said. South Gloucestershire Council said it "fully accepted" the findings. Castlebeck said the criticisms in the report were being "actively addressed". The independent report also revealed concerns were raised before the abuse was uncovered in a secretly-filmed investigation by the BBC's Panorama programme. The safety of dozens of patients was raised but the NHS was only informed about a handful of cases. From the opening of the hospital in 2006 until 2011, there were 38 safeguarding alerts raised about 20 patients from the unit. Only one in five of those was reported to the NHS. Three alerts the NHS does not appear to have been notified of in any way - an allegation of abuse by staff, concerns about the attitude of some staff, and an allegation of assault by a member of staff. Peter Murphy, the head of South Gloucestershire Safeguarding Adults Board, said he wanted to convey his "deep regret" for what had happened at the hospital. "In particular, I would like to express our regret to the hospital's patients and to their families, friends and carers," he said. "Winterbourne View hospital should have been a safe place for them to be treated with care and compassion. "But the hospital's owners, Castlebeck Care Ltd, failed to provide that care." Margaret Flynn, the report's author, said Castlebeck had "promoted an unworkable management structure" and relied on "poorly paid and untrained staff". She added the firm did not "act on the concerns, complaints of Winterbourne View visitors or patients". The Panorama programme, aired in May last year, showed "compelling images" of patients being slapped and restrained under chairs, having their hair pulled, and being held down as medication was forced into their mouths, Ms Flynn said. By Matthew HillBBC West health correspondent With the increasing use of the private sector delivering care to  patients, Winterbourne View raises fundamental questions about whether their safeguards are as robust as the NHS. It's emerged from the serious case review that unlike NHS hospitals, private institutions like Winterbourne have no electronic system to report so-called 'Serious Untoward Incidents'. Even on the rare occasions when primary care trusts were told about these concerns by social or health workers, they were not reported to the body charged with spotting patterns of abuse - the Strategic Health Authority. If they had been, then the scandal  could have been revealed before the BBC filmed undercover. It remains to be seen whether the Department of Health will address this question, when they give their report into Winterbourne View. She said patients had been "traumatised and remain very distressed that they were not believed". But she was also critical of "out of sight, out of mind" commissioning by primary care trusts when placing patients in Winterbourne View. Castlebeck, the report added, "appears to have made decisions about profitability, including shareholder returns, over and above decisions about the the effective and humane delivery of assessment, treatment and rehabilitation". The average weekly fee per patient was Â£3,500, but Castlebeck did not tell the review how this was spent. Ms Flynn said the turnover at Winterbourne View alone was Â£3.7m a year. She said the staff were "chronically bored" in their roles at the hospital, which was "poorly managed". A spokesman for Castlebeck said: "We hope that the lessons learned and the actions that flow from this rigorous report will mark the start of a new chapter for care in our sector. "The actions towards people with learning disabilities by former members of staff at Winterbourne View Hospital were both wholly unacceptable and deeply distressing for all concerned and we are truly sorry this happened in one of our services." He said significant changes had been made within their organisation that included extensive changes to board membership, all new operations structures, strengthened clinical governance and increased staff training and development. "Importantly, we are determined to ensure that each of the persons for whom we care and their family are firmly at the heart of everything we do," he said. Avon and Somerset Police were also criticised for not informing South Gloucestershire Adult Safeguarding of all their contacts with the hospital. Det Ch Supt Louisa Rolfe, head of CID at the force, said there were 29 calls and nine incidents over a period of nearly three years relating to Winterbourne View, and agreed a pattern should have been noticed. She said investigating officers had "overly relied on people perceived as professionals and experts in their field" at the hospital, for information. David Behan, chief executive of the Care Quality Commission, said: "There is much for all the organisations involved with Winterbourne View to consider in Margaret Flynn's thorough and comprehensive report. "I will ensure that the Care Quality Commission responds fully to all the recommendations for CQC. "We will continue to work with other organisations to improve communications and sharing information to ensure we all protect those who are most vulnerable." Dr Gabriel Scally, who chaired the NHS review panel, said: "The most striking thing - apart from the sheer horror of what was done to patients - is that even though lots of different people knew bits of what was going on, nobody put it all together and did anything about it. "That is most disturbing. "We should take this opportunity to look at reporting systems and make sure a system is in place so when incidents happen they are properly reported and investigated." Anne Milton, parliamentary under-secretary of state for public health, said primary care trusts had spent money "recklessly" putting patients in Winterbourne View. She said changes were being made to make it the responsibility of those commissioning care to ensure quality is a priority. The report was published as two organisations warned that moving people hundreds of miles away from their families increased the risk of abuse taking place. Mencap and the Challenging Behaviour Foundation said they had received 260 reports from families concerning abuse and neglect in institutional care since the Panorama programme was broadcast. Eleven former workers at the private hospital have pleaded guilty to almost 40 charges of abuse and are due to be sentenced later at Bristol Crown Court.	Fundamental changes are needed in how care of vulnerable adults is commissioned and monitored, a report into abuse at a private hospital said.
Tait, who picked up a medal alongside Kate Hornsey in the women's pair, was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2013. Australian Rowing head coach Chris O'Brien said: "Sarah has been, and will continue to be, an inspiration to many Australian rowers. "She was a strong role model to young athletes, and particularly influential with our emerging female athletes." Tait and Hornsey finished behind Great Britain's Heather Stanning and Helen Glover in the 2012 pairs final, which was GB's first gold of London 2012. Glover became friends with Tait following the final and told BBC World Service she was an "incredible personality". She added: "To achieve so much in her too short life - two beautiful children, a husband, an Olympic silver medal, the list goes on. "Above all that, she was an inspirational and truly lovely person that has paved the way for women in sport at home in Australia and all over the world."	Australian rower Sarah Tait, who won silver at the London Olympics in 2012, has died aged 33.
The pound has gained 1% and although the stock market is down more than 2%, a lot of that happened before Theresa May called a snap election for 8 June. Still, market watchers are reading the tea leaves and have made a few observations. Since the big fall in sterling after the referendum result, the pound has tended to rise at times when a softer Brexit has looked more likely and vice versa. Today's rise in the pound suggests markets are betting that Theresa May will (a) win and (b) win a bigger majority than she currently has, which (c) will make her less dependent on hardline Eurosceptics in her own party. The theory goes that all this will allow her room to deliver a softer Brexit, which will be less of a shock to the economic system - hence the pound strengthens. The stock market is falling because most of the UK's largest companies make their money in foreign currencies. As the pound rises, those foreign earnings are worth less in sterling terms. That is the way markets are reading it today, but as we know, markets can be pretty terrible at reading politics and it is certainly not a done deal that Theresa May will use any consolidation of her position as an opportunity to peddle a softer line on Brexit. One thing an election in June does give her - if she wins - is more breathing room. She will be under less pressure to deliver a "clean" Brexit in 2019 without the deadline of another election in 2020 bearing down on her. Facing the country again while possibly still enmeshed in tortuous negotiation (with potentially little control over immigration by then) was an unappealing political prospect. Business groups have been broadly supportive of the move. All other things being equal, businesses prefer the additional certainty that a government with a larger majority can provide. The EEF said "a fresh and stable mandate from the country can only provide greater certainty about the future direction of travel for policy", while the CBI had a cooler response, saying: "Distraction from the urgent priorities of seeking the best EU deal and improving UK productivity must be kept to a minimum." While it's true that this election is a further complication to an already mind-bogglingly complex situation, very little can meaningfully be achieved in negotiations until after elections in France, Germany and possibly Italy. Everyone else seems to be having an election, so we might as well have one here while the political and economic going is good. The economy has defied the gloomy prognosis that many, including the Treasury and the Bank of England, gave before the referendum. Average wages are rising a smidgeon faster than prices (although this is expected to change imminently) and there are a record number of people in work. The economic window for this political gamble is open.	Markets don't generally like surprises and today's announcement certainly qualified as one, but the market reaction has so far been fairly calm.
The African champions let in goals from Kerem Demirbay and Timo Werner, who netted twice, while Vincent Aboubakar grabbed a consolation goal for them. The Indomitable Lions also had Ernest Mabouka sent off after confusion involving the Video Assistant Referee. Sebastien Siani was initially dismissed in a case of mistaken identity before the error was corrected. Colombian referee Wilmar Roldan consulted the VAR after a high challenge by Mabouka on Germany's Emre Can led to Cameroon captain Siani wrongfully receiving a yellow card. However, the initial outcome was to switch the colour of Siani's card to red. It was only after Cameroon's players insisted he review the incident again that he realised his error, rescinded Siani's dismissal and sending off the correct culprit Mabouka. "The referee didn't give any explanation," said Cameroon coach Hugo Broos. "First of all he gave a red card against Siani, then the video ref called him back and told him it was the wrong player, so Mabouka was sent off. "Both players [Can and Mabouka] had their legs high, so I don't see why he had to give a red card. I think everyone is confused "I didn't understand it and I still don't understand it now. "I think this is something for the referee. He and he alone can explain what happened in that incident." As Group B winners, Germany will face Mexico in the last four in Sochi, Russia. Portugal will play Chile in the other semi-final.	Cameroon's Confederations Cup campaign is over after a 3-1 defeat by Germany in their final Group B game on Sunday.
It began on Friday when Ramzan Kadyrov, leader of the southern Russian republic, labelled opponents of President Vladimir Putin "enemies of the people" and called for such "traitors" to be prosecuted for subversion, claiming they were working in league with the West. Mr Kadyrov has now re-asserted his claims and gone even further in an online editorial for pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia. Referring to a "half-witted rabble", he offered opposition activists the services of a Chechen psychiatric hospital to treat their "mass psychosis". "I promise we won't spare the injections. We can do double," he wrote. A boxer-turned-insurgent and now a self-styled "foot soldier" of President Putin, the man known simply as Ramzan is not someone many in Russia dare criticise openly. Human rights groups have long accused him of presiding over widespread abuses in the Russian republic, and the key suspect in last year's shock shooting of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov beside the Kremlin walls had been deputy commander of one of his elite battalions. He was referred to by Ramzan as a "true patriot". This time, the Chechen leader's comments appear to have touched a nerve. The most dramatic response came from a little-known independent politician in Siberia, who raged against Ramzan on his Facebook page as the "shame of Russia". "Why don't you get lost?" Konstantin Senchenko told him, and let "normal, honest people" work for the good of the country. But the Siberian was soon eating his "hasty" words. The next day, he apologised profusely on Facebook for his "discourtesy", apparently after multiple calls from Chechnya. Cartoons of his sudden change of heart soon spread on social media, depicting him begging forgiveness with a gun to his head. In an ultimate humiliation, the shamefaced politician was seen in a video clip apologising personally to Ramzan for his "emotional outburst". Activists on Twitter then took up the Siberian's insult with the hashtag #KadyrovshameofRussia. Well-known opposition journalists followed that by filming themselves making fake, grovelling apologies to Ramzan "for existing". One was filmed running on a treadmill with no trousers, just as a young Chechen man was forced to do recently after criticising Ramzan Kadyrov on Instagram. Meanwhile, a group of prominent Russian liberals has begun gathering signatures demanding his resignation, and a St Petersburg politician has called on prosecutors to examine his statements for extremism. But the backlash has only increased the tirade from Chechnya, where local politicians have been falling over themselves to express devotion to their leader. None has outdone the speaker of parliament, Magomed Daudov, who posted a photograph of his boss holding back his huge, fierce dog on a leash and warned that Tarzan's teeth were "itching" - naming four well-known opposition figures whom the hound would presumably love to sink them into. "Tarzan has become very frisky. We can barely restrain him," wrote the speaker in an Instagram post that attracted over 6,000 likes. "Just imagine what would happenâ€¦ If it weren't forâ€¦ Democracy." There is some talk that this is all a show of strength by the Chechen leader: a reminder of the considerable forces at his disposal amid talk of a power struggle between Grozny and Moscow. But the Kremlin has remained tight-lipped throughout, prompting others to conclude that it more likely endorses Ramzan's actions. Parliamentary elections are due later this year and, with an economy battered by falling oil prices, there's concern that opposition groups could capitalise on potential social unrest. "It's a message to all of those who don't agree with what's happening," argues former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is now an opposition activist in exile and himself one of the obvious targets of Ramzan Kadyrov's ire. "The authorities are afraid and they decided to frighten society," wrote Mr Khodorkovsky on his blog. Another commentator has suggested that the Chechen leader simply wants to underline his loyalty to Moscow ahead of a wave of forced budget cuts and to ensure that the generous flow of federal subsidies to Chechnya does not stop. Whatever the motive, the practice of singling out traitors is seen as particularly dangerous in the wake of Boris Nemtsov's murder. A year ago, Putin loyalists were still beating the drum of patriotism following the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine; state TV was lashing out viciously at Kremlin critics; warnings that Ukraine-style revolutions would not be tolerated were rife. Ramzan Kadyrov's latest outburst has resurrected the idea of an enemy within and the search for a scapegoat. "The situation is very tense now," Mr Senchenko, explained by phone from Krasnoyarsk, pointing to Russia's mounting economic problems. That concern is what motivated his own Facebook rage against Chechnya's leader. "Some people really think there are enemies of the state and it's not clear what can enter their heads," he warned.  "So we need to be careful."	Traitors, jackals and vile liberals are just a few of the choice descriptions of Russia's opposition emerging from Chechnya in recent days, in a war of words that threatens to escalate.
Land and Housing Minister Anna Tibaijuka had not shown "due diligence" when she took the money, he said. Ms Tibaijuka, a former UN official, denies any wrongdoing. She is a high-profile casualty in a corruption scandal that has rocked Tanzania's government and energy firms, straining relations with donors. On 17 December, Attorney-General Frederick Werema resigned after MPs accused him of authorising the fraudulent transfer of about $120m to an energy firm. He denied the allegation, but said he was stepping down because the controversy had "disrupted the country's political atmosphere". Mr Kikwete, in a televised address, said the government was still investigating allegations of impropriety against Energy and Minerals Minister Sospeter Muhongo and his permanent secretary Eliakim Maswi. The president's office later said that Mr Maswi had been suspended, pending the outcome of the probe. Ms Tibaijuka rejected parliament's call for her resignation, saying the $1m was a donation for a school where she serves as the main fundraiser. She accepted it in good faith and presented it to the school, she said. However, Mr  Kikwete said he had dismissed her because "one of the biggest questions raised is why this money was not paid directly to the school and was instead deposited in a personal bank account in her name," Reuters news agency quotes him as saying. Ms Tibaijuka was the executive director of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme, before she became an MP and government minister in 2010. Tanzania's parliament, which is dominated by the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party, has been putting pressure on Mr Kikwete to sack top officials accused of siphoning government money in collusion with businessmen linked to the energy sector. An investigation by a parliamentary watchdog committee found that about $120m had been taken from an escrow account, paid to an energy firm and then given to various government ministers. A group of 12 donors - including Japan, the UK, the World Bank and the African Development Bank - decided in October to withhold about $490m until the government took action over the alleged corruption. Mr Kikwete took office in 2005 with a promise to tackle corruption in government.	Tanzania's President Jakaya Kikwete has fired a senior government minister accused of wrongly taking $1m (Â£640,000) from a businessman.
In his regular BBC Sport column, football pundit Robbie Savage looks at why Liverpool look a long way off repeating last season's title challenge, how they should line up against Chelsea and the physical and mental battle Steven Gerrard faces to secure a long-term future with the Reds. It is only six months since Steven Gerrard's slip helped the Blues clinch a famous win on Merseyside that derailed Liverpool's title bid. Back then, at the end of April, the title was in the Reds' grasp. This weekend, I think we will see again how far away they are from mounting another title challenge. They are miles away from the level required for that, and will have to improve and work hard just to get in the top four. If they manage it, then securing back-to-back seasons in the Champions League should be seen as success for Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers. But not all their fans see it that way. I had some unhappy Reds supporters calling me up on  606 on BBC Radio 5 live last weekend to give their manager stick. Part of Liverpool's problem is that they overachieved massively last season, which has raised expectations unrealistically. That is not Rodgers' fault. Where he can be questioned is in the transfer market, especially up front. Between them Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge scored 52 of Liverpool's 101 Premier League goals last  season. With Suarez sold and Sturridge playing only three out of 10 league games so far this season because of injury, Rodgers has lost a lot of goals from his line-up. But he has had money to spend and I do not think he has bought the right strikers to fit his system. Looking at Rodgers' options up front for Saturday, Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini are his three available front men, and the bottom line is that they are not good enough. It is not just that they do not look like scoring. There is a big difference in their work-rate compared to what Suarez and Sturridge gave the team. That means Liverpool are not starting games with the same intensity they did last season, or pressing teams high up the pitch to force them into mistakes. Doing that in 2013-14 Liverpool scored 59 first-half goals, 13 more than any other team, and scored in the first half of 34 out of 38 league matches - again the most in the top flight. In their first 10 games of this campaign, they have only managed a total of four goals before half-time, in three different matches. Instead of being on the front foot, they are having to chase games. They look pedestrian and that is not just the centre-forward's fault. When I have watched them, no matter what formation they play, they do not seem to have any runners going past their striker from midfield. Again, last season that used to happen all the time, but I was at St James' Park last weekend to  co-commentate on their defeat by Newcastle, and the only player to run beyond Balotelli in the first half was Gerrard, who did it once. Another problem is set-pieces. Liverpool were lethal from them last year, scoring with more than any other top-flight team. More than a third of their goals in 2013-14 came from corners or free-kicks, at a rate of almost one a game. That has dropped off dramatically. Sadly for Rodgers, seeing the goals drying up is not his only problem. Liverpool's defence was seen as their weakest link last season and, despite trying several different combinations, he did not get it right. From Mamadou Sakho for £18m in 2013 to Dejan Lovren for £20m this summer, Rodgers has thrown a lot of money at the problem but is still trying to find an answer. They still look all over the place at the back. Statistically, they are no worse defensively than last season - but they are also no better. Liverpool play and complete as many passes as before, and also keep as much possession. But with them no longer being able to outscore the opposition, it is no surprise their results have been affected. What Liverpool lack at the back is a leader, and their goalkeeper does not give them much help there. Simon Mignolet is clearly an excellent shot-stopper but I don't see him coming off his line enough, or commanding his box. Rodgers tried three at the back against the Magpies, but I cannot see him doing the same against Chelsea. He was criticised for resting players against Real Madrid on Tuesday but I agreed with him for doing it. Liverpool can still qualify for the knockout stages in Europe if they win their last two games in Group B and their weakened team actually did better against Real in Spain than the full-strength side he picked at home. Now he has to decide who to play against Chelsea, but whoever he picks, Liverpool will need to show a huge improvement on their recent displays. My team to face Liverpool: Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Toure, Moreno, Can, Gerrard, Sterling, Coutinho, Lallana, Borini. For me, Lovren is the big signing who makes way, with Kolo Toure keeping his place after doing well at the Bernabeu. It is a big call to drop Lovren when Rodgers has spent so much money on him, but he has just not been good enough. It is hard to see Liverpool winning on Saturday because Chelsea are on a different planet He was poor against Newcastle and has been poor all season. Although he has got the height that Liverpool will need to defend set-pieces against Chelsea, I saw him get bossed around by Bobby Zamora when Liverpool played QPR at Loftus Road. You have to think that Diego Costa would make mincemeat of him if he is up front for Chelsea. To compete, Liverpool will need a solid four in the middle, with their full-backs looking to join the attack. Whether it be Glen Johnson on the right or Alberto Moreno on the left, when one goes forward, then the other should sit back. That way, Liverpool will always have five defensive players to guard against Chelsea's counter-attacks. Going forward, they need their full-backs to contribute in the same way they did last season when they overlapped down the flanks or broke forward with speed. The trio of Adam Lallana, Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling as attacking midfielders provide pace, trickery and creativity and, leading the line, Borini gives more energy than Lambert or Balotelli. He will have to work hard down the channels to keep Chelsea's defence busy. Even if all of that works, however, it is still hard to see Liverpool winning on Saturday because Chelsea are on a different planet to every other Premier League team at the moment. Jose Mourinho's side have not been at their best in the last couple of games but they have not lost any of them either. The only way you would describe their form as disappointing would be in comparison to the way they started the season, when they were electric. The Blues do not seem to have a weakness and, just like in April, I see them leaving Anfield with three points. There is no title on the line this time, but it will still hurt the home fans. Whatever happens on Saturday will not make up for what was probably the worst moment of Gerrard's career. He may never make up for it, but there is no way he is finished. He was Liverpool's best player against Newcastle and, despite it still being uncertain whether he will get a new Reds contract in the summer, I definitely see him as being part of their longer-term future. Playing in that defensive midfield role, he can remain competitive in the Premier League. I cannot see him being allowed to leave Anfield but, if he does, he will end up at another top club. The older you get, the harder you have to work, though, and extending his career will be a mental battle as well as a physical one. At 34, he does not have to prove he can ping a ball 60 yards, deliver a great free-kick or make a crunching tackle. What he has to show is that he can still get about the park well enough to do all of those things effectively. Because, whether he likes it or not, every time he has a bad game he will hear the accusation that "his legs have gone". Of course he is still fit and can still run. He is probably one of the fittest players at Liverpool. At 36, when I was at Derby, I was still in the top two or three players whenever we did the bleep test. What happened against Chelsea last time probably destroyed Gerrard on the inside But it is the recovery that will test him. When you are flying, you can close someone down, then charge into the next challenge or situation. As you get older, it is harder to get to the next man in time to make a difference. That is what people mean when they say your legs have gone. There is nothing worse as a high-energy midfield player to know that, two or three years ago, you could have made that next challenge - and now you can't. I knew it when it happened to me. I would try not to think it but you cannot escape it and it was horrendous. I began to doubt myself and whether anybody would want me to play for them. What does not help is what other people say. Managers and players told me I was finished but I had to keep believing in myself. I knew I was not the player I was, but I still felt I had something to offer. For me, Gerrard undoubtedly does too. Along with Sterling and Sturridge he is still one of Liverpool's most important players. Of all the players I faced in my career, he was the one I would have loved to have played with. He was a nightmare to play against because he had everything. At his peak he was the best midfielder the Premier League has seen. Saturday will be a difficult occasion for him because what happened against Chelsea last time probably destroyed him on the inside. Of course he will be thinking about it before the game - he must think about it all the time - but he has not let it stop him. It would have been easy for him to quit after a disappointment like that, but he has kept going like he always does. It is that kind of desire that will keep him going beyond the end of this season too. Robbie Savage was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan	Chelsea's return to Anfield on Saturday brings back unhappy memories for Liverpool and their immediate future is not much brighter either.
Although there is some scepticism surrounding the claim, the international community has condemned the action. The news has also prompted reaction, particularly on social media. Since the news broke 'North Korea' has been mentioned 211,000 times on Twitter and has been among the top trending topics worldwide. So what can be done to prevent North Korea's move escalate to an international crisis? Here are some of your ideas. @martinedobor tweets there should be greater agreement on weapons: It's saddening and worrying that North Korea says that it carried out an H-bomb test. That claim must be taken seriously by any person who cares about peace. This is a wake up call for the UN to swing into action in full force and stop North Korea's obsession with nuclear bombs. The UN should not wait until small ripples turn into huge waves before thinking of how to get to the shore. Josephat Ombuna, Nairobi, Kenya @Jackalchachal thinks North Korea should be invited to talks: North Korea needs to be accountable for its actions like any country. It's time for the world to have some serious dialogue with them. If you want to have nuclear weapons then you need to be trusted and must abide the rules. This would be the first big step to resolve this issue. Let's invite Kim Jong-un to the United Nations in New York and get down to business. Chris, Northfield, Vermont USA @SouljaTroy1996 has a simple solution: In my opinion sanctions are the way to go, if at all possible.  Unfortunately this may cause more hardship on the people of the North. War is out of the question - we are fighting enough wars in the Middle East.  I have thought deeply about this question for a while now (still am) , with China being an ally this would also be a concern for NATO.  Kim Jong-un is a loose cannon and unpredictable and that makes him a threat. Robert Anderson, Dundee, Scotland UK I think we need to be prepared for any possible threat of them using weapons such as these. However, I don't think we should charge in and force North Korea to stop producing nuclear weapons. That is of course assuming they have been successful in making them. If we or any other countries for that matter become aggressive to them, the retaliation could be much worse. It's best to prepare for the worst but mainly ignore them. It's not like many of the countries condemning North Korea's actions have any moral high ground when they themselves are sat upon a huge stockpile of nuclear weapons. It's like a child in a playground showing off their strength, if they are not challenged they won't have the opportunity to show their force in a fight. Mark, Kingswinford, West Midlands, England UK The former NBA basketball player, Dennis Rodman who has had a number of well publicised meetings with North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un is cited by @ZZR600E3 as someone who could help: Compiled by Andree Massiah	North Korea's state television has announced the country has tested a hydrogen bomb.
Sayes Court will double in size and provide an additional 210 places by September 2015. Surrey County Council said it needs to "bridge a Â£215m funding gap" for 13,000 places, blaming an "unprecedented demand" on its services. It said nearby Esher School is also being completely rebuilt to boost capacity by 210 places.	An artist's impression of how an expanded primary school in Addlestone will look has been unveiled.
Kelly Mahon, of John Broad Avenue, Arleston, was arrested after the infant was reported missing from his home on 24 February. He was found safe and well the same day. Mahon, 41, admitted one charge of kidnap at Shrewsbury Crown Court and was remanded in custody. Judge Robin Onions told the defendant she was likely to receive a custodial sentence "of some length". During a hearing at Telford Magistrates' Court last month the prosecutor told the court the kidnap had been "pre-planned". Kelly Crowe told magistrates on 26 February: "When officers go around there (to Mahon's home) a number of baby items were present; cots, clothes, baby clothes, both female and male and also a to-do list. "She made reference to sterilisers, nappies, and milk for babies." The case has been adjourned until 12 May.	A woman has admitted kidnapping a nine-week-old baby boy in Telford.
The Scottish Salmon Company (SSC) said it was hit by "exceptional mortalities" amounting to 1,300 tonnes - about a fifth of its potential harvest. SSC also said "biological challenges", such as sea lice, had led to a lower mean weight of fish harvested. As a result, operating costs increased and earnings dipped, it added. The Oslo-listed company reported losses of Â£1.4m in the quarter before interest and tax. This was despite a 39% increase year-on-year in revenue as a result of increased harvested volumes and higher market prices. Revenue stood at Â£25.5m, while volumes rose from 5,130 tonnes to 5,486 tonnes. SSC managing director Craig Anderson said: "This quarter has been challenging and, like many other operators in the sector, results have been impacted by biological issues. "We have been working for some time to develop effective long term solutions to tackle these industry wide issues, such as the use of cleaner fish to combat sea lice. "In the shorter term, we are using a range of established best practice methods to manage the situation. "We remain focused on growing our business and developing our export markets to enable us to capitalise on the continued demand for premium Scottish salmon. "Maragay Mor, our new site in the Hebrides, has been commissioned and is an important element in delivering our strategy of long term sustainable growth."	A Scottish salmon producer has reported third-quarter losses after suffering an "unprecedented" level of deaths at its fish farms.
Oxfordshire County Council said two independent studies found having one organisation to run all services could save £100m over five years. But the plan is opposed by the county's five district councils, who have argued in favour of three councils instead. All the authorities have been criticised for engaging in a "turf war" over their rival devolution plans. County council leader Ian Hudspeth said public money should be spent on providing services, rather than running "six separate organisations". The district councils have argued the county needs an elected mayor, rather than fewer councillors, to get more money from Whitehall. Oxford City Council leader Bob Price said the county's plan was "the wrong proposal at the wrong time". He added: "For the people of Oxford, a unitary council would be a disaster. "The needs of a multi-ethnic and socially mixed urban community are very different to the more rural parts of the county." Leader of West Oxfordshire District Council James Mills said the aim of the district councils' devolution bid was to get more money from central government. He said: "A mayor gives a strong voice to Oxford, single point of contact to government and is accountable to the people of Oxfordshire." But Mr Hudspeth said the proposal was needed because the county council "cannot continue to make savings without further cuts to local services". He said: "One council for Oxfordshire would be more efficient and simpler for residents, with one phone number, one website and one point of contact." Residents are being asked for their views before the final proposal is considered by the county council's cabinet on 14 March.	A proposal to abolish six councils and create one county-wide local authority for Oxfordshire has been published.
Fears have been expressed by some in the industry that a breakdown in the current agreement could result in more cash machines charging a fee. LINK - which operates the network of 70,000 ATMs in the UK - said that its commercial model is "under review". Some banks are thought to be unhappy about the fees they currently pay. As a result all 38 members of the LINK network are due to have a series of meetings to try to reach an agreement, beginning next week. At the moment around 75% of ATMs are free to use. But Peter McNamara, the Chief Executive of Note Machine, a member of LINK, said that consumers could face being charged at many more of them. "If the proposals that are being put forward by LINK went ahead, we estimate that you could be losing up to a quarter of the free-to-use ATM sites in the UK," he told BBC Radio Five Live. At the centre of the dispute are the so-called interchange fees. When a customer of one bank uses a cash machine belonging to another bank, the customer's own bank pays a fee to the operator, in the region of 25p. It's thought that banks with a large number of card-holders feel they are being unfairly penalised. "Some of the very big banks have a lot of cardholders who do a lot of transactions, and they feel that perhaps their share of what they are putting in the pot that pays for ATMs is disproportionate and potentially too high," said Mr McNamara. "They may go outside the LINK mechanism to find a cheaper way of making those machines run, which is the risk in the system that could develop." LINK said the discussions could take several months. "We operate in a competitive market and there are other ATM networks in the UK available for card issuers and ATM operators if our model becomes unattractive," a spokesperson said. "We are working hard to avoid this situation."	The operator of the UK's ATM network has said it is working hard to keep cash withdrawals free for millions of bank customers.
The offers to protect religious sites have come from Muslims who include military servicemen, lawyers and Emmy Award-winning TV broadcasters. The JCC Association of North America, a network of cultural centres, reported more than 100 bomb threats against Jewish centres in the first two months of 2017. On Monday alone, the organisation said another 31 threats were made against Jewish centres including a gunshot fired through a Hebrew school window at an Indiana synagogue. In a tweet, a former Muslim marine, Tayyib Rashid, pledged: "If your synagogue or Jewish cemetery needs someone to stand guard, count me in. Islam requires it." Mr Rashid, known by his Twitter handle @MuslimMarine adds in his Periscope video that "I've seen a tremendous outpouring of love and support from all Americans, from Muslims, from my fellow Jewish Americans, from Christians, from atheists, from everyone". The former Marine welcomes people to meet him in a local coffee shop in his home town in Grayslake, Chicago, in his "initiative to help promote peace between Muslims and non-Muslims". He aims to open dialogue about "the recent atrocities committed by some hateful people" that were responsible for the "destruction and desecration of the graves of people of Jewish faith". He adds: "I condemn that wholeheartedly and I stand in solidarity with all my Jewish citizens." His now-viral tweet that has been "liked" by 12,000 supporters prompted an overwhelming number of responses from Jewish Twitter users with one inviting him over for Seder,, a ceremonial dinner held on the first two nights of Passover. Other Muslims, including Emmy Award-winning TV Broadcaster Momin Bhatti took to social media to pledge their support in his call to protect Jewish sites. This latest show of solidarity comes shortly after an online Muslim-led crowdfunding campaign to help repair a vandalised Jewish cemetery raised more than $150,000 (Â£122,000). On 20 February, more than 170 headstones were damaged at the Jewish cemetery just outside St. Louis, Missouri. In the same week, 100 headstones were overturned and broken at a Jewish cemetery in Philadelphia. Unity between Muslim and Jewish organisations was also displayed after an online campaign to raise funds for an arson damaged mosque in Florida raised more than $70,000 (Â£57,000). Adeel Karim, a member of the Islamic Society of New Tampa, posted on his Facebook profile that he was "floored" after realising that many of the donors to the campaign were Jewish. "I couldn't understand why people were donating in what seemed like weird amounts to the cause. There are sums of 18, 36, 72 dollars etc. then I figured out after clicking on the names Avi, Cohen, Goldstein, Rubin, Fisherâ€¦. "Jews donate in multiples of 18 as a form of what is called 'Chai'. It wishes the recipient long life. " President Trump opened his first speech to a joint session of Congress on 21 February by condemning the recent bomb threats and desecration of cemeteries. "Recent threats targeting Jewish community centres and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms." Written by Wais Bashir, UGC & Social News team	Following the recent spate of bomb threats against Jewish community centres and the desecration of graves at cemeteries in Philadelphia and St. Louis, some Muslims have turned to social media to offer to guard Jewish sites.
In only his second season with Porsche, Webber and his two team-mates, German Timo Bernhard and New Zealander Brendon Hartley, need a fourth-place finish or better in the 6 Hours of Bahrain on Saturday to complete a remarkable run of success for car number 17. Winners of the last four races, they were runners-up at the previous event in June and took third at Spa in the race before that in May. Webber, 39, cannot remember such a hot streak of form beyond his days in junior categories and admits he never expected to be in contention so quickly at this stage of his return to sportscars. "I'm very surprised we're in this position," he said. "We had a few tough races at the start of the championship and now here we are in Bahrain ready to close the championship off hopefully. "It started in an incredible June where we got two cars home at Le Mans and had a 1-2 against Audi. "Since then we have won every race and I don't think we envisaged that - the aggressive mentality of the F1 approach." Not surprisingly, after his 12 years at the highest level of single-seater, open-wheel competition, Webber draws heavily on his experience of fighting against the likes of Lewis Hamilton, Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso, the other contenders for the 2010 title at the final race of that season in Abu Dhabi. He learnt the hard way on that occasion, finishing eighth behind his three rivals and third overall in the championship. This time he aims to make amends. "Being a professional for so long, you have the ability to deal with the emotions and really pull it right back and just keep the basics in order, and that's what we've got to try to do," said Webber. "Having the scenarios played out if we've got things we need to deal with - are we rehearsed, are we practised, are we ready to go? "We don't want any what ifs, any 'woulda, coulda, shoulda' at 10pm on Saturday night." Media playback is not supported on this device Webber's challenge in 2010 was complicated by his acrimonious relationship with Red Bull team-mate Vettel. The German profited most from the Australian's problems with backmarkers under the lights at Yas Marina by winning the race and the championship. The team dynamic within the three-man Porsche 919 Hybrid line-up is noticeably more harmonious. "You have to be super, super open with each other in terms of communication, in terms of getting the best out of each other, the little strengths and weaknesses of each other in terms of corners you like, what type of tracks you like, what type of conditions do you like and even how the car develops," he revealed. "We've got a young bright-eyed and bushytailed youngster in Brendon Hartley, Timo Bernhard is super experienced in this category and then myself with a lot of experience. "We try to make the sure the car doesn't know who's in the car, which driver is in. The car has to be very benign, so we can use it." In his recent autobiography, Webber was critical of the way Red Bull allowed his partnership with Vettel to disintegrate following a series of incidents in 2010 and beyond. It's a marked contrast to his views on his current set-up where he believes his F1 experiences have contributed to Porsche's surge to the head of the field. "To put together this campaign with a great bunch of guys, I have felt pretty instrumental in it and I suppose that's as rewarding as other grand prix wins because I've had a bit more impact here in trying to help. "It's a big, big team and everyone's done a great job but it's been really nice to have been able to help behind the scenes and if we can put the icing on the cake it'll be a really, really nice feather in my cap." Webber and his team-mates lead the Audi trio of Switzerland's Marcel Fassler, Germany's Andre Lotterer and France's Benoit Treluyer by 13 points. They extended their advantage by an extra point on Friday after Bernhard and Hartley secured their fifth pole position of the season at the Sakhir track. The circuit where the wind blows off the desert and makes tyre performance even more critical is not one of Webber's favourites. Last year's third place with Porsche was his best in 11 races here. "We're in good shape, very confident we can have my best result here ever and then if that's enough - and that will be enough if I'm on the podium steps - then it'll a very, very long night on Saturday." And if he does become world champion for the first time in his 21 years in motorsport, will it rank as his finest achievement? "It would certainly be right up there, mate. It's not easy to win a grand prix and it's not easy to do what we've done here. "My biggest, biggest achievement to put together this championship with the other guys…?" His pause before delivering a classic Webber line says it all. "We'll certainly give it a good shake, yeah." After the anti-climax in one Middle Eastern kingdom on 14 November 2010, Webber has atonement in his sights on 21 November 2015 in another.	Almost exactly five years after Mark Webber lost his best chance of becoming Formula 1 world champion, the Australian is on the brink of fulfilling his title dream in the World Endurance Championship this weekend in Bahrain.
Female players had been considering striking in an effort to address wage discrimination. The US Soccer Federation sued the players' union to prevent a strike that could have caused the team to miss the summer Olympics. The judge ruled the players are not eligible to strike because of a provision in an earlier contract. In March, five players filed a lawsuit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging pay discrimination. They argued female players were sometimes paid four times less than their male counterparts despite holding the world title. The players' union had not called a strike over the issue, but had been weighing the possibility. The US Soccer Federation - the sport's national governing body- filed its own suit to prevent a strike. It argued a no-strike clause from an early collective bargaining agreement carried over to the 2013  memorandum of understanding that the players are currently working under. The union argued that a no-strike clause had never been specifically laid out in the terms of the latest agreement. However, the judge sided with the federation citing oral and email communication between the two sides, as evidence that the original terms were passed to the new agreement. "A collective bargaining agreement may be partly or wholly oral and a written collective bargaining agreement may be orally modified," Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman wrote in her ruling. The team is expected to perform well at the Olympic Games in Rio and the federation said it feared a strike would damage the development of football in US. The players, many of whom have expressed outrage at gender pay differences, will continue their wage discrimination case.	A judge has ruled that the world champion US women's football team does not have the right to strike.
Tour de France winner Wiggins became the most decorated Olympian in British history, with a total of seven medals. He won the cycling time trial after Glover and Stanning rowed to victory in the women's pairs; all three were hailed by PM David Cameron. GB's Michael Jamieson later took the silver in the men's 200m breaststroke. Team GB kept the nation waiting until day five of the Games for the first home gold medals; however, there are high hopes for further podium finishes in Thursday's cycling. After his victory, Wiggins, 32, cycled through cheering crowds gathered at Hampton Court, where he hugged his wife Catherine and his children Ben and Isabella. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday evening, Wiggins said that despite his success, he did not consider himself to be Britain's greatest ever Olympian. He also said that, fresh from his victory in the Tour de France, he had been "greedy" and also intended to win Olympic gold. "I felt I could do both," he said, adding that the crowd support on his Olympic time trial ride was "incredible". David Cameron described the successes in rowing and cycling as a "golden moment for Britain". Mr Cameron said: "I think it's already a great Olympics, already a great start but this is really going to put rocket boosters on it for the whole country. I'm very, very excited." Meanwhile, a BBC investigation has found illegal websites still offering tickets - which they have no right to sell - and which buyers may never receive. Police have warned that such sites do not have access to tickets. Det Supt Nick Downing, the head of the Olympic crime squad, said: "If they're an authorised site selling tickets, you've got to ask the question - where did they get their tickets from? How can they guarantee a supply? They can't." In other developments: Briton Chris Froome took the bronze medal in the time trial, which was watched along the route by an estimated 300,000 people. Wiggins's grandmother Maureen Cousins was also at the side of the road as he crossed the finish line. "I screamed when he won.  It is a combination of delight and relief... We all think he is the greatest," she said. Earlier, Glover and Stanning made history by becoming the first British women to win an Olympic gold medal for rowing. Mr Johnson said an "historic triumph will be celebrated throughout the country today". "It's an outstanding achievement and I'm sure it will spur on all our athletes in the medal stakes. It's fantastic - Go Team GB," he added. Glover, 26, a former PE teacher from Penzance, Cornwall, had been rowing for only four years before securing gold with Stanning, 27, a Royal Artillery captain, from Lossiemouth, Moray. They stormed home in front of cheering crowds at Eton Dorney after leading from the start of the women's pair race. After crossing the line they hugged each other and saluted the crowd, which included Princes William and Harry and the Princess Royal. Speaking at the finish line, Glover's mother Rachel said her family was "absolutely delighted". Stanning is likely to be deployed to Afghanistan next year. Her commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Craig Palmer, said: "Soldiers from 32nd Regiment Royal Artillery were thrilled to watch the race from their bases in Afghanistan, while their friends and families watched it here in the UK. "I am sure that they have been inspired by her performance and we look forward to welcoming her back to the regiment later this year." Lt Col Palmer spoke to Stanning on the BBC News Channel, telling her she had "done a very special thing". "We're looking forward to a very big party when you do come back to the regiment," he told Stanning. Labour leader Ed Miliband praised the athletes as "fantastic" and said the games were going "beyond" expectations.	Praise has poured in for cyclist Bradley Wiggins and rowers Helen Glover and Heather Stanning after they scooped Britain's first gold medals of 2012.
The mural, called Slave Labour, disappeared from a wall in Wood Green, north London, in February and appeared in a Miami sale. But it was removed from the lot after protests by Haringey Council. It is now up for auction in June in Covent Garden by the Sincura Group. A local councillor and the local Trades Union Congress have attacked the sale. The mural, which depicts a boy hunched over a sewing machine making Union Jack bunting, appeared on the side of a Poundland store last May, just before the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. A spokesman for the auctioneers Sincura said the mural "has been sensitively restored under a cloak of secrecy", and will go on show alongside pieces by Damien Hirst, Andy Warhol, Mario Testino and Russell Young. But Wood Green councillor Alan Strickland said: "This is a piece of art given to the community for public enjoyment, and people will find it galling that you can only view this work at an expensive champagne reception, when it belongs with the people of north London, not a private owner. "We saw the level of public anger last time, as the story went around the world, and I expect the same this time." And Keith Flett, secretary of the Haringey Trades Union Congress, said: "The Slave Labour Banksy belongs to the people of Haringey not to a wealthy private client." When the mural was up for auction in Miami, it was expected to fetch up to Â£450,000. There was suspicion it had been stolen when it disappeared but the Metropolitan Police said there were "no reports of any theft". Slave Labour will go on sale at the London Film Museum on 2 June.	A Banksy artwork which had been withdrawn from an auction in the US has been put up for sale again.
A monthly travelcard costs £135 ($174), according to a Deutsche Bank report - £33 ($43) more than Dublin, which was ranked second priciest city. Auckland, where a ticket costs £95 ($123), came third, while New York City, at £91 ($118), came fourth, and Tokyo fifth at £86 ($111). Transport for London (TfL) said the findings did "not show the true cost of transport in other countries". The survey also found the cost of travel in the capital dropped since 2014, when commuters paid £165 ($213). Source: Deutsche Bank Its authors ranked London tenth most expensive for petrol, and the third for car hire. Hong Kong had the priciest petrol, while Amsterdam was the most expensive for a daily car rental, the report said. London's taxis fared slightly better, ranked 20th in a list of 47 cities, with Zurich topping the list for the most expensive fares. For quality of life, London was ranked 33rd in the world, similar to other "mega cities" such as Tokyo, Paris and New York. According to the report, these cities "rank very low" for quality of life, mostly due to "high living costs, crime, pollution and commuting time". "This is highly subjective and one person's long commute may be another person's chance to catch up on Netflix," the report said. "Megacity dwellers may also forsake short-term quality of life for aspirational reasons," the report added. Wellington, in New Zealand, was ranked as the best city to live in in terms of quality of life, followed by Edinburgh, Vienna. Melbourne and Zurich. In February, TfL revealed its fares income was down £90m last year. TfL is currently planning to cut £16bn from its budget by 2020/21 as it  aims to become self sufficient with its operating costs. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has frozen fares on buses and trams until 2020, but travelcard prices are set by train operating companies and so are not under full TfL control. A TfL spokesman said: "London also has one of the most extensive set of travel concessions in the world with free or discounted travel for children, the over-60s, students and veterans."	Public transport in London is the world's most expensive, a report says.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Alan King-trained seven-year-old, a 16-1 shot, led all the way for the 19-time Champion jockey, who is retiring this season. Ma Filleule (5-1) was second with 5-2 favourite Don Cossack third. McCoy said: "I would love to say it's a relief, but I actually got such a thrill riding him." The Northern Irishman did not seem to fancy his chances much pre-race, but trainer King's seven-year-old put in some spectacular leaps on the way round. "I was actually thinking I wouldn't mind riding the horse in next year's Champion Chase," said McCoy after his victory. "He ran away with me for a mile and a half and I thought he would never keep it up but I was quite happy coming down the hill." McCoy's wife Chanelle and several of his family members were waiting in the winner's enclosure to greet him after his victory. "He wanted that feeling one more time," said Chanelle. "Heading into day three he wanted one more time to ride a winner at Cheltenham, to soak up the atmosphere and not finish his career without one more winner."	AP McCoy won his first race of his final Cheltenham Festival on day three, riding Uxizandre to victory in the Ryanair Chase.
The US-born radical Yemeni cleric Anwar al-Awlaki is head of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Two brothers believed to be mid-ranking al-Qaeda officials died in a drone strike in south Yemen on Thursday, Yemeni officials said. The attack came just days after al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden was killed in Pakistan by US Navy Seals. The Pentagon refused to comment on the reports that Anwar al-Awlaki was specifically targeted in Yemen. According to Yemen's defence ministry, the missile fired by the drone hit a car in in the province of Shabwa carrying two brothers, identified by Yemeni officials as Musa'id and Abdullah Mubarak. But reports from Washington now suggest US commanders had believed they had one of al-Qaeda's most valuable targets in their sights. "We were hoping it was him," one unnamed US official told CBS News. The reported attempt to kill Mr Awlaki is believed to be the first known US military strike within Yemen since May 2010, when missiles mistakenly killed one of Mr Saleh's envoys. In September the country's foreign minister said that such unmanned strikes had been suspended. The report comes as Yemenis continue to take to the streets to demand that Ali Abdullah Saleh, president for 30 years, step down. According to the Wall Street Journal, there were several attempts to target Mr Awlaki on Thursday. He escaped an initial attack of three rockets fired at a vehicle in which he was travelling and then swapped cars with the two brothers, who were killed in a second strike by a single drone, the newspaper said. Washington considers the Yemen-based al-Qaeda branch the world's most active terror cell. It is estimated to have some 300 fighters within Yemeni strongholds, clustered around mountain ranges where the central government has little reach. The group is said to have inspired attacks by Muslims within the US as well as plots to smuggle explosives on planes heading to the US. Some analysts are convinced that, after the death of Bin Laden, Mr Awlaki represents the greatest threat. An American-born cleric of Yemeni descent, he was placed on a terrorism blacklist in July 2010 and had imposed financial sanctions on him. US officials say Mr Awlaki helped recruit Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian accused of attempting to blow up an airliner as it flew into Detroit on 25 December 2009. Maj Nidal Hasan, the US Army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 comrades in the Fort Hood shooting in 2009, sought religious advice from Mr Awlaki and saw him preach in the US state of Virginia in 2001, US officials say. A student found guilty of attempting to murder British MP Stephen Timms in London was also said to have been inspired by Mr Awlaki's online sermons.	A US drone attack in Yemen targeted but failed to kill one of al-Qaeda's most influential figures, US reports say.
However, that's at the heart of the media's frustration. The fact is the campaign has become a succession of tightly controlled photo opportunities... by all the main parties. This has become the hi-vis, hard hat election. It's been the predictable campaign gear for both David Cameron and George Osborne. No walkabouts. No risk of a verbal ambush by ordinary voters. But there's a fascinating side to this election where the campaign can offer raw politics, unplugged... where the voters engage with the politicians seeking their support. Election hustings have been one of the big successes of this general election. Magazine Monitor: Where did the word 'hustings' come from? There have been a record number of them held in churches, according to research by one Christian charity. I've been to a number of hustings so far and there's one reason why they work. The debates and exchanges are close up and often personal. Voters are able to question the politicians and get beyond some of the campaign sound bites and slogans. They also often highlight issues that are just overlooked in the "noise" of national campaigning. That was the case at a hustings at the All Nations for Christ church in the Normanton area of the Derby South constituency, where the audience were mostly from the city's African Caribbean communities. On the platform, representatives from all the parties, including Dame Margaret Beckett, who's defending a 6,000 Labour majority in Derby South. There were questions from the audience on immigration, Europe and schools. But one question particularly gripped the audience: Why were graduates from the African Caribbean communities three times more likely to be out of a job, six months after leaving university? The study was carried out by the Bow Group think-tank and Elevation Networks, a youth employment charity, and was based on interviews with 2,500 students over two years. It also found that black students were not being given the same opportunities as white students. One angry voice in the audience shouted: "That's outrageous and disgraceful". It got backing from the Greens. "That indicates there's some form of discrimination going on in the jobs market," said John Devine, the Green Party candidate for Derbyshire's Amber Valley. There was a suggestion from one questioner for employers to be forced by law to audit who and where they recruit staff. A precise solution perhaps required a precise response. But the Conservatives' Derby South candidate Evonne Williams tiptoed round this one. "It's something that we haven't considered but I'm happy to take it back to the party," she told the questioner. And Labour's Dame Margaret? "We're going to be looking at the Equalities Act to see if it needs modernising and updating. So your suggestion is exactly the kind of idea we will be looking at," she said. One platform speaker wanted to go much further. Lucy Care, the Lib Dem's candidate for Derby North, suggested that all job application forms should no longer include the person's name. "We would like to have name blank application forms," she said. "So all you read is their experience and what they've done. Often the name of the applicant can deter some employers from short listing or recruiting." As for UKIP's Derby South hopeful Victor Webb, he didn't completely rule out having such a recruitment audit, but: "I wouldn't do this because of the burden of cost and regulation on small businesses." For this hustings audience, maybe no instant solutions but they got the politicians thinking about their concerns. "The key is getting people engaged," said Marc Grant, the event organiser. "It's the first time we've held a hustings at the church." "We wanted to show why politics is so important to our daily lives and I'm really pleased so many  people came along." Whatever the outcome of this election, the locally organised hustings have emerged as a big campaign winner.	David Cameron has been telling reporters that this election campaign is not about photo opportunities but more about the UK's long term economic revival.

This huge housing project - now one of the most desirable addresses in Gaza - was built since 2012 with money from Qatar and named after the former ruler of the wealthy Gulf state. So far, more than 2,000 Palestinians - mostly low-income families - have moved in. The complex has a new school, shops, an impressive mosque and plenty of greenery. There is a constant whirr of construction noise as more buildings are erected. But as the regional crisis over Qatar escalates, Palestinians here - as elsewhere in the impoverished territory - fear the loss of their major donor and ally. "We're going to be the victims," says one resident, Baha Shalaby. "Everything's going to stop - the money, the support, the infrastructure, the building work." In recent years, Qatar has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on new homes, a hospital and main roads in the Gaza Strip. It has pledged about $1bn (Â£780m) more. It is not yet clear how its projects will be affected by the ongoing row with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab countries. They are trying to economically isolate Qatar, accusing it of fostering terrorism - a charge the emirate strongly denies. However, the engineer in charge of fixing Gaza's main north-south road warns of the possible wider implications of any cuts. "We have hundreds of workers, all supporting families," says Hanafi Sadallah. "Levels of unemployment in Gaza are very high, so if the Qataris end our funding, they'll all just be left sitting at home." Just over 40% of Gazans are out of work, according to Palestinian officials - one of the highest unemployment rates in the world. One of Saudi Arabia's demands has been for Qatar to stop backing Hamas, which runs Gaza. The Islamist group took over by force a decade ago - ousting Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces, a year after Hamas won legislative elections. Hamas leaders insist that Qatari help to Gaza has been primarily charitable. "The houses that were built are not for Hamas, the streets that were asphalted are not for Hamas," one senior figure, Mahmoud Zahar, tells the BBC. "The humanitarian institutions - hospitals and schools, they're also for the Palestinian people.  All attempts to hitch Hamas to Qatar are wrong and void." Israel says Hamas has also used foreign funding to bolster its military infrastructure, which its blockade aims to keep from strengthening. To try to prevent any such accusations against its projects, Doha set up its own coordination office in Gaza and deals directly with contractors or works with UN agencies. Nevertheless, Qatar's initiatives have buoyed Hamas through difficult times - the tight border restrictions imposed by both Israel and Egypt, and three bloody conflicts with Israel. There has also been political and diplomatic support from Doha. The emir of Qatar is the only head of state to have visited the Palestinian territory since Hamas has been in charge. Many leaders of the group - including its former head, Khaled Meshaal, have been living in luxurious exile in Doha. Now as Hamas seeks to ease pressure on its patron, several have reportedly left at Qatar's request. Last month, the group also announced a new policy document in Doha, which tempered its long-held position against accepting an interim Palestinian state, and made no mention of its parent organisation, the Muslim Brotherhood. The Brotherhood has been categorised as a terrorist group by Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The latest developments concerning Qatar come amid mounting political and economic strain on Hamas. US President Donald Trump has said that, alongside the so-called Islamic State, al-Qaeda, and Hezbollah, Hamas is contributing to a regional "humanitarian and security disaster". Last week, Israel agreed to a PA plan to cut power supplies to two million people in Gaza that will reduce their daily average of four hours of electricity by 45 minutes. Hamas accuses its political rivals of plotting with the Trump administration and Israel to unseat it in Gaza. Many of its members link local and wider regional developments. "Qatar is being punished for speaking freely and supporting the Arab Spring," remarks Hamas parliamentarian, Yahya Musa, at a small rally in Sheikh Hamad City. "It's being punished for supporting us and the resistance. We stand with our brothers to reject US plans against Qatar and the conspiracy against the resistance." As he speaks, children wave Palestinian and Qatari flags, alongside signs reading "Solidarity with Qatar" and "We are all Qatar". The Palestinians here are banking on a diplomatic solution to the crisis. Without one, they know they could end up paying the price.	In a playground in Sheikh Hamad City, children shriek with delight, while their parents chat in the cool shade of their peach-coloured flats.
Jean Say killed his son and daughter two years ago. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said Southwark Sapphire unit in south London "encouraged" victims to withdraw allegations to boost detection rates. The Metropolitan Police said substantial changes had been made. The rape allegation against Say was dismissed by a detective sergeant based at Southwark, who said the circumstances did not constitute rape because the woman "consented". The report by the IPCC said: "There is no doubt from the evidence that the woman made an allegation of rape at Walworth police station which should have been believed and thoroughly investigated." The IPCC said the Southwark Sapphire squad's approach of "failing to believe victims" was "wholly inappropriate".  It also said it was "under-performing and over-stretched". Deputy chairwoman of the IPCC Deborah Glass said: "There's no doubt this was an incredibly serious, shocking incident. "We know with all the cases that we've dealt with that the consequences of not dealing with allegations of rape can be extremely serious. "This is yet another tragic illustration of that." Say, 62, a retired concierge, attacked his daughter Regina, eight, and son Rolls, 10, in their beds at his home in Southwark in 2011, while they were on a weekend access visit. The Old Bailey heard he killed them to spite his wife who had left him. He was given a 30-year minimum term. The case sparked a wider investigation into the work of the unit between July 2008 and September 2009, the results of which have now been published. The IPCC has carried out five previous inquiries into Southwark Sapphire command and it is the police watchdog's ninth investigation into the Met's response to victims of sexual violence. By Danny ShawHome affairs correspondent, BBC News No one will ever know if Jean Say's children would be alive today if he'd been arrested and investigated for rape three years before he stabbed them to death. But if police hadn't "no-crimed" the rape allegation, the chances are Say's threatening and violent behaviour would have been uncovered. The Say case is the most egregious example of the dysfunctional approach to rape investigations at the Southwark Sapphire unit; what we don't know is how many other sexual assault victims were wrongly disbelieved and the impact that's had on them and on others. Although Scotland Yard says the Sapphire units have changed for the better, the practice of no-crimeing is still a problem across other forces: in England and Wales reported rapes are three times as likely to be written off as other incidents are. Home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said three Metropolitan officers who had been facing possible dismissal over a previous bungled investigation into the serial sex offender Kirk Reid, were still with the force. Two of them, a superintendent and a detective inspector, have been promoted. A detective sergeant is facing disciplinary proceedings for alleged gross misconduct in connection with the allegations. In another case, Det Con Ryan Coleman-Farrow, who was based in Southwark, was jailed for 16 months in October last year for failing to investigate rape and sexual assault claims. A second officer, based in Islington, north London, is still under criminal investigation. In total 19 officers from across London have been disciplined, including three who have been sacked. A Met Police spokesman said: "We have for some time acknowledged that previous investigation of rape and serious sexual assault in the MPS was below standard. "The activities identified in this report came during that era and highlight specific issues within Southwark which resulted in unacceptable actions by local officers. "It is as a result of such failings that we have made substantial changes to the investigation of rape and serious sexual assault, both in terms of structure and revised working practices."	A police officer at a sex crime unit encouraged a woman to drop a rape claim against a man who went on to murder his two children, a report has said.
The Transocean Winner, which has diesel on board, was under tow west of Lewis when it was hit by severe storms. It became detached from the tug boat overnight, before running aground at the beach of Dalmore in the Carloway area. Stornoway Coastguard said there were no personnel on board the rig and there was no risk to life. However, coastguard personnel have blocked access to the beach for health and safety reasons. The Marine Accident Investigation Branch has begun an investigation into the incident. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said it was monitoring for any pollution from the rig. The agency said Transocean Winner has 280 metric tonnes of diesel on board. Scotland's Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said key agencies were doing what was necessary to "ensure the rig is secured and to minimise any immediate safety or environmental risks". A spokesman said: "Following the grounding of the semi-submersible drilling rig Transocean Winner on the Isle of Lewis, the Secretary of State's Representative (SOSREP) for Maritime Salvage and Intervention Hugh Shaw is now in discussions with the owners Transocean and the salvors. "The Maritime and Coastguard Agency's counter pollution branch and the SOSREP have both been monitoring the situation since yesterday evening and the local authority, police and Marine Scotland have all been kept informed." Salvage company Smit has been mobilised to deal with the incident, the MCA added. The Transocean Winner was being towed from Norway to Malta. BBC Alba reporter Angus Macdonald said the structure was "towering over the beach". He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: "The rig has more or less come ashore at the beach of Dalmore. "Dalmore is a well-known beauty spot. It is a sandy beach where a lot of surfers turn up because the waves are so good." Foster Evans, who visited the stretch of beach involved last week, sent BBC News Scotland online an image showing how the wide sweep of sand usually looks. Western Isles SNP MSP Alasdair Allan and MP Angus MacNeil said the incident underlined the need for Scotland to have two emergency tugs. An emergency towing vessel has been sent to the scene from the Northern Isles. Scotland used to have two of the boats available to the coastguard to cover the north and west coasts, before the UK government reduced the service to a single ship in 2012. Mr Allan said: "This morning the tow line between a tug and the Transocean Winner oil rig snapped in heavy weather, resulting in the rig going aground at Dalmore on the west side of Lewis. "I am grateful to hear that there have been no injuries reported after this incident but it does leave us with a significant environmental threat to deal with. "I am also deeply concerned to hear that the Maritime and Coastguard Agency's nearest emergency towing vessel was in the region of 14 hours away."	A 17,000-tonne drilling rig has run aground after being blown ashore on the Western Isles.
Education Secretary John Swinney launched the "intense" three month consultation last September. But the group which mounted a legal challenge against the scheme said there had been no updates from ministers. The government said it held more than 50 meetings during the consultation. A spokesman said Mr Swinney would update parliament in "due course". The named person policy, introduced as part of the Children and Young People Scotland Act of 2014, set out to appoint a single point of contact, such as a teacher or health visitor, to look out for the welfare of all children up to the age of 18. The consultation was announced six weeks after the UK Supreme Court ruled elements of the policy to be "incompatible" with the right to privacy and family life, as set out in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) Feedback from it was due to be collated by the government, with Mr Swinney intending to outline his next steps before the end of 2016. But the No To Named Persons (NO2NP) group, which mounted the legal challenge, said they were not involved in the process. Freedom of information requests by the group for details of the consultation discussions were rejected. NO2NP spokesman Simon Calvert said: "The engagement period was really a sham consultation because Mr Swinney only wanted to deal with those who support the scheme and organisations mainly funded by the government. "He refused to engage with us even though we represent an important cross-section of Scottish society, huge numbers of parents and more than 35,000 people who signed our petition. "The three-month 'engagement' has long since ended. It looks like it could be more like six or seven months, March or April 2017, before we hear anything." He added: "The Supreme Court agreed with us that the intrusive sharing of private information which was at the heart of the Named Person scheme was unlawful. "The court granted our appeal, and ordered the Scottish government to pay all our costs. It was a total defeat for the Scottish government. "The substantial delay in announcing their plans to try to navigate a way around the ruling indicates that reality is finally beginning to bite." After the legal challenge, Mr Swinney was forced to act to halt the roll-out of the named person scheme, which has already been trialled in some parts of Scotland. It had been due to be introduced across the country on August 31 2016, but Mr Swinney said he hoped the named person policy can now come into force a year on from that. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: "The engagement involved more than 50 meetings with some 250 organisations and groups - and included around 700 young people, parents/carers, practitioners and professionals. "This included leaders from health, education, local authorities, police, faith communities, charities, unions and professional bodies. "The deputy first minister will update parliament in due course."	Campaigners opposed to the Scottish government's named person scheme claim ministers have refused to engage with them during a consultation on plans to reform the policy.
Maya Kantengule was found at the bottom of a swimming pool at Waveney River Centre holiday park in Burgh St Peter, Norfolk, on May 1 2016. She was declared dead later that day at James Paget University Hospital. South Norfolk Council environmental health officer Chris Coker said people swam at the centre at their own risk. Maya's father, Livial Kantengule, said in a written statement at the inquest in Norwich that he spoke to Jane Rainer, the mother of his daughter's best friend, as he arrived and decided not to wait at the pool during the party. He returned there with his wife, Glenda, after receiving a message there had been an accident. Maya had already been taken to the hospital near Great Yarmouth. Her parents were at her bedside when she was pronounced dead. Mr Kantengule said he did not ask if there was a lifeguard. "Jane used to volunteer to help with the swimming lessons, so we assumed Maya would be adequately supervised while in the pool," he said. Maya, from Smith's Walk, Oulton Broad, near Lowestoft, Suffolk, attended Dell Primary School. Jaqueline Bell, a teaching assistant at the school, said in a written statement that Maya started weekly swimming lessons in reception year. "She was nervous in the water and would use armbands and a woggle," she said. Mr Coker told the inquest the indoor pool at Waveney River Centre could be privately hired. He said it was 1.5m (5ft) at its deepest and signs were up stating there were no lifeguards on duty and that people swam at their own risk. The inquest, expected to last two days, continues.	A seven-year-old girl drowned at her best friend's birthday pool party while there was no lifeguard on duty, an inquest heard.
Uber CEO Travis Kalanick made the admission while speaking at a private event in Vancouver, according to Canadian tech news site Betakit. The $1bn figure was later confirmed with Uber China by Reuters news agency. US-based Uber launched in China in 2014 and competes against the country's largest taxi app Didi Kuaidi. Uber is available in more than 40 cities in China. It announced last year that it would expand into 100 Chinese cities over the next 12 months. "We're profitable in the USA, but we're losing over $1bn a year in China," Betakit quoted Mr Kalanick as saying. He described China as the firm's largest international marketplace. But Uber's market share is dwarfed by that of the larger Didi Kuaidi. "We have a fierce competitor that's unprofitable in every city they exist in, but they're buying up market share." Mr Kalanick has previously said the firm had gone from a tiny 1% share of China's market at the beginning of 2015 to about 30% to 35%. Didi Kuaidi, which is backed by Chinese tech giants Tencent and Alibaba, has now also partnered with Uber's rival US ride-sharing service Lyft. Mr Kalanick said he had recently raised about $200m to help the firm compete in emerging markets, Betakit said. "I wish the world wasn't that way. I prefer building rather than fundraising. But if I don't participate in the fundraising bonanza, I'll get squeezed out by others buying market share," he added. Uber is available in 380 cities around the world, according to the website.	App-based car-hire service Uber is losing more than $1bn (Â£699m) a year in China, as it struggles against what it called a "fierce competitor".
Both sides remain in qualifying places with Essex top on run-rate and Glamorgan in third. Essex make one change with Jamie Porter replacing Matt Quinn in their seam attack., while Glamorgan are unchanged. Glamorgan won the toss and captain Jacques Rudolph chose to bat first on a cloudy afternoon. Both teams face a hectic schedule of five limited-overs games in a week, as the One-Day Cup and T20 Blast groups both reach their climax. Essex lost to Surrey by 66 runs despite 131 from Jesse Ryder, while Glamorgan went down by 33 runs away to Somerset,  in their previous matches. "Though we're still in the top four, a win (over Somerset) would have set us on the way to a quarter-final- we want to win every game" Glamorgan fast bowler Michael Hogan told BBC Wales. Essex coach Chris Silverwood told the club's website "The players know they have to bring consistency to their game,  if we are to ensure Essex are in the quarter-finals of both white-ball competitions, and we need to start with a win against Glamorgan." Glamorgan won the 2015 match in Cardiff by 146 runs, with Colin Ingram hitting 130. Essex : Browne, Westley, Ryder, Bopara (c), Lawrence, ten Doeschate, Foster, Zaidi, Napier, Masters, Porter. Glamorgan: Lloyd, Rudolph (c), Bragg, Ingram, Donald, Wallace, Wagg, Meschede, Salter, van der Gugten, Hogan.	Essex and Glamorgan will be looking to recover from defeats as they meet at Chelmsford in the One-Day Cup.
Union leaders are hoping the formation of a first so-called Dairy Producer Organisation (DPO) could help put the industry on a stronger footing. It would involve small family farms across Wales linking up to talk with milk processors as one legal entity. The hope is that streamlining the way farmers deal with creameries could attract more of them to Wales. But a report has warned that persuading farmers to join up could be a challenge, and there would be no guarantee that processors would agree to strike a deal with them. The main purpose of a DPO is to negotiate terms and conditions of supply, including price, with one or more milk processors. As such, they are exempted from some aspects of competition law. There is currently one DPO in operation in England, and one in Scotland - but they are commonplace throughout Europe, especially in Germany. A working group, involving figures from both farming unions, is investigating what role DPOs could play in securing the industry's future in Wales. Aled Jones, chairman of NFU Cymru's dairy board told BBC Wales that "farmers coming together" could lead to "a far more professional means of operating". "At the moment we deal on an individual basis with the processor but I think long term we are far stronger if we speak with one voice and have that cooperation and attitude of mind." Recent years have seen farmers protesting outside creameries over milk prices but Mr Jones said the focus should now be on "building better relationships". "Nearly half of Welsh milk is carted out of Wales to be processed and that puts us in a weak position.  We saw that last year when there was an oversupply of milk and farmers in West Wales were in danger of not having a buyer for their milk." "Looking forward we must try and attract new investment or increased processing in Wales.  And obviously, to do that you need to work in a professional manner." Mr Jones, who farms in Caernarfon, Gwynedd, explained that the idea offers security and added value to both producers and processors, but that setting one up could take years. A report commissioned on behalf of the working group warned that persuading farmers to take part could be far from easy. Plan needed for rural economy - Labour AM Farming collaborations have a relatively poor track record in Britain and many producers would be wary of getting their fingers burnt, said report authors Promar International. However the consultants concluded that farmers in Wales should seriously consider DPOs or live with "the insanity of accepting the status quo". UK government ministers have indicated that they see a role for them - so farming leaders claim the concept - a product of EU law - will be unaffected by Brexit. The position of many dairy producers in Wales is fragile after a tumultuous few years, during which the price of milk fell sharply. At one point in 2016 it was below 20p per litre at farm gate prices - the average price paid to all producers for milk sold to dairies. Figures show the number of dairy farms here has nearly halved during the last 15 years, with an average of three farmers a month leaving the industry. Farming leaders say that though the price of milk has recovered somewhat in recent months, many producers are still struggling and are now shouldering heavy debts. A new three part series, starting on BBC One Wales on Monday, takes an in-depth look at the industry's problems. Gareth Wyn Jones - Milk Man is on at 20:30 GMT, BBC One Wales on Monday 6 February 2017 and later on BBC iPlayer.	Dairy farmers in Wales have been urged to club together to help negotiate a better price for their milk.
Accountancy group UHY Hacker Young claimed new "boutique" distillers were pushing big brands off the shelf. It said Scotland saw a 50% rise in new distilleries over the past year, from 12 in 2015 to 18 in 2016. In England, a record 35 new distilleries were opened last year compared with 28 the previous year. James Simmonds, of UHY Hacker Young, said: "Both the craft spirits and the craft brewery sectors are going through a period of explosive creativity. "You can see that in everything from the logos, branding and advertising of these products. "The quality of the product is streets ahead of their big brand competitors. "It is no wonder that the global drinks giants are worried, and the best way they have found to deal with that new competition is get out chequebooks and buy them."	An "explosive creativity" of craft spirits has seen 50 new distilleries open across the UK last year, according to a study.
Officers are searching in Weston Park East in Bath, where the first foot was found by dog walkers in February. A second foot was found in a garden of a property in Weston Park in July, and another was found in a garden in nearby Cranwells Park two weeks ago. Police said they do not believe a crime has been committed and it is likely they were all medical exhibits. Det Insp Paul Catton, of Avon and Somerset Police, said he "strongly believed" the finds had originated from "an old private collection". A spokesman said the new search was being carried out "to try to find anything which may be connected to the discoveries". "All three feet show signs they have come into contact with animals and it is likely that they have been moved to the locations they were found from a specific source," Det Insp Catton added. "Regulations are significantly stricter these days compared to several decades ago and we believe the source is most probably someone who used the feet as a teaching aid. "It is also possible these feet may have been found by someone who has then innocently buried them in an attempt to dispose of them and they have then been unearthed by animals, or that animals have disturbed the location they were stored." Tests on the first foot showed it was human but found very little DNA, and preliminary results from on the second foot were similar. The third foot, found on 5 August, is still undergoing tests. Mr Catton said officers were searching the whole of the park and the grounds of a nearby school. "The school is in a central location to the sites where all three feet have been found and the last thing we want is for a member of the public to come across one of these unpleasant finds. "We believe someone knows something about where these feet have come from and would appeal for them to get in touch," he added.	Police are searching a park in an area where three severed human feet have been found this year.
Two men have already been arrested and questioned on suspicion of theft and fraud offences. A man in his 30s is still being detained in Wexford. Another man arrested in Limerick on Monday has been released without charge. Brexit Secretary David Davis said on Tuesday the news that one of the London attackers - Rachid Redouane - moved there from Dublin should not alter existing travel arrangements between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. The two men were arrested by Garda detectives and questioned about the use of documentation and Irish social security numbers in Redouane's name, Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported. An Garda Síochána (Irish police) detectives are working to identify the activities, addresses and associates of Rachid Redouane during his time in Ireland. However, Gardaí have stressed their investigation is focused on theft and fraud offences rather than terror. The investigation into Redouane's time in Ireland has intensified over the past 48 hours. Thirty-year-old Redouane, who claimed to be Moroccan-Libyan, was based in the the east London suburb of Barking. He was also known by the name Rachid Elkhdar. Details of his identity and background began to emerge when an Irish identity card was found on his body after he was shot dead by police. It is understood he arrived in the UK in 2006 and applied for asylum but that the application was rejected in 2009. It is reported that he lived in Harrow in north-west London. The details of when he arrived in the Republic of Ireland or how long he stayed there are still not clear. However, it is believed he obtained a European Union residence permit which allowed him to travel to the UK whilst he lived in Ireland. He married a British woman, 38-year-old Charisse Ann O'Leary, in Dublin in 2012. It is understood that it was this marriage that allowed Redouane to obtain a 4 EU FAM card given to spouses of European Union citizens. The couple lived in Rathmines on Dublin's south-side. Reports suggest Redouane worked as a pastry chef. He left Ireland after the marriage and settled in the UK before returning to Ireland in 2015. Redouane is understood to have had a 17-month-old daughter with Ms O'Leary, although the couple were estranged. According to reports, he visited his child before carrying out the London attack along with Khuram Shazad Butt and Youssef Zaghba. An imam who runs a mosque in Galway that came under attack on Monday, has called on both the British and Irish governments to take action in the wake of the recent attacks. Imam Ibrahim Noonan said "extremists and radical minds" had been visiting and lecturing in certain mosques in Dublin, Cork and Galway. "I do know that the Garda are working hard and doing something, but maybe they are restricted due to human rights law," he told Good Morning Ulster. The imam said his mosque had been attacked during the hour of prayer on Monday, as some people blamed he entire Muslim community in the wake of extremist attacks. "Every time attacks happen, all Muslim communities around Ireland, Northern Ireland, and the rest of the UK become tense," he said. "Ninety-nine, point nine, nine, nine percent don't associate themselves with these terrorist extremists - they are peace loving people."	Irish police say further arrests are expected as part of an investigation into the background of one of the London attackers who lived in the Republic of Ireland.
Those selling the illicit weapons often disassembled and sent them in different packages or embedded them in old stereos or printers, the report found. Researchers found that firearms and related goods generated 136 sales per month and a monthly revenue of $80,000 (Â£62,000). The firearms trade has gained attention following recent terrorist attacks. The dark net is a part of the internet that requires specific software to access, in order for users to remain anonymous. While the trade was unlikely to fuel large-scale terrorist operations, it had the potential to become the platform of choice for "lone-wolf" terrorists to obtain weapons and ammunition, the report said. Non-profit organisation Rand Corporation Europe, working with Manchester University, found 52 unique vendors selling weapons or similar items such as ammunition, explosives, or components such as silencers across 811 listings and 18 markets. Police believe the 2016 Munich shooting, which left nine people dead, used weapons purchased on the dark net. Lead author of the research, Giacomo Persi Paoli, said: "Recent high-profile cases have shown that the threat posed by individuals or small groups obtaining weapons illegally from the dark web is real. "The ability to not only arm criminals and terrorists, who can make virtually anonymous purchases, but also vulnerable and fixated individuals is perhaps the most dangerous aspect." Guns account for less than 1% of items sold on the platform, with its main trade being in narcotics. Nevertheless, the volume being sold "can be considered sufficiently high to be a cause of concern for policy makers and law enforcement agencies", said the report. The study involved collecting data from 12 dark net marketplaces during a week in September 2016. Most of those selling guns were based in the US, but Europe was the most popular destination for the weapons they sold. Judith Aldridge, co-investigator on the study, said: "In very simple terms, anyone can connect to the dark web and within minutes have access to a variety of vendors offering their products, which are most often illegal. "The dark web enables illegal trade at a global level, removing some of the geographical barriers between vendors and buyers, while increasing the personal safety of both buyers and sellers through a series of anonymising features that obscure their identities."	Criminals and terrorists are using the so-called dark net to buy weapons, a new study has suggested.
Her husband, Arif Yunus, was given seven years on similar charges. They have been in prison since their arrest nearly a year ago. Both still face separate charges of treason, which carries a life sentence. The couple say the case was politically motivated. Azerbaijan has repeatedly jailed human rights activists. President Ilham Aliyev has ruled Azerbaijan since 2003 and has cracked down hard on political opponents. Both Leyla, 59, and Arif Yunus are in poor health - she has diabetes and hepatitis C, while he has a heart condition and has suffered two strokes. US-based Human Rights Watch condemned their prosecution as a "despicable political show trial". Levan Asatiani, an Azerbaijan researcher at Amnesty International, said "the judicial system has once again revealed itself to be no more than a cynical tool by which President Ilham Aliyev crushes any dissent". In a statement to the BBC the Azerbaijan government said the court process in the case was "open and free". It also said "the independence of judiciary and the rule of law have been fully guaranteed" in Azerbaijan. Leyla Yunus was found guilty of fraud, illegal entrepreneurship, tax evasion and falsifying official documents. She is director of the Institute for Peace and Democracy, a human rights group founded in 1995. It has worked with the Council of Europe - Europe's leading human rights watchdog - and other international bodies, informing them about actions to stifle political dissent in Azerbaijan. Mrs Yunus had been pressing for reconciliation between oil-rich Azerbaijan and neighbouring Armenia, to defuse their frozen conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenian forces took control of the disputed territory in 1994 soon after the break-up of the Soviet Union. But sporadic clashes continue between them and nearby Azeri forces. (Update 20 August: This article was amended to add the official viewpoint of the Azerbaijan government.)	A prominent human rights activist in Azerbaijan, Leyla Yunus, has been sentenced to eight-and-a-half years in prison for fraud and tax evasion.
It comes as an Inverness sufferer claimed that his former employer was deliberately ignoring his correspondence. James Nicol believes he was exposed to asbestos while working on council houses in the 1980s. He wants Highland Council to acknowledge that he was exposed. The local authority said it could not comment on Mr Nicol's case, adding that any claims would be handled by solicitors. The 85-year-old worked for Highland Regional Council, now Highland Council, as a labourer. He believes that he came into contact with asbestos while refurbishing council properties in Inverness. Mr Nicol also later worked for the regional council as a school janitor. In March this year, the pensioner was diagnosed with mesothelioma, an incurable lung cancer almost always caused by asbestos exposure. He said he had first noticed a change in his health during a swimming session. "I could swim, but not the same speed and that was why I went to my doctor," Mr Nicol told BBC Scotland. "I went to my GP and from then on it was x-rays, scans and a biopsy in Aberdeen." Mr Nicol was given his diagnosis at his local hospital, Raigmore in Inverness. He said: "The consultant told me it was 'all bad, no cure Mr Nicol'." While still in receipt of a local authority pension, he claims Highland Council has turned its back on him by failing to reply to correspondence from his solicitor on his condition. A Highland Council spokesman said: "We cannot comment on this matter. "However, we can confirm that where individuals appoint solicitors to make claims against Highland Council, communications would be made via the person's solicitor and not direct with the claimant." The charity Clydeside Action on Asbestos was set up in 1984 and initially dealt with shipyard workers. However, senior welfare rights officer and director Phyllis Craig said the charity was now increasingly seeing people from other areas of employment, and also more women. She said: "We are seeing a lot of people from the construction industry and we are seeing teachers, nurses, doctors, policemen and firemen. "Many of them had been exposed 20 years ago. Ms Craig added: "There is a myth that women were only exposed to asbestos if they washed their husband's overalls." She said women were just as prone to the risk of being exposed to asbestos fibres working in a building, such as a hospital or school, as their male colleagues were. Law changes in Scotland give sufferers and their families north of the border more rights than anywhere else in the UK. Some sufferers, such as former textile factory worker Annie McGhee from Motherwell, may be eligible for a one-off payment from the government. She believes she was exposed to asbestos while working at a knitwear factory before she married and raised a family. Mrs McGhee said: "It was the only place where I worked. I worked there for eight years solid. "I worked in the steam presses and there were lots of big pipes up above and there were no windows in the place." Two years ago this month, Mrs McGhee was diagnosed with terminal cancer following a year and half of experiencing shortness of breath because of fluid in her lungs. The use of asbestos was banned in 1999 and campaigners warn that the legacy of the material will continue for decades yet with case numbers unlikely to peak for another 20 years.	Campaigners have called for greater support for victims of asbestos-related cancer who are fighting for civil compensation.
The Bosnia-Herzegovina international is bidding for full match fitness after recovering from a hernia injury but is unlikely to start against QPR. The visitors are without midfielder Jordan Cousins, who will miss the rest of the season with a quadricep injury. On-loan winger Kazenga LuaLua is back in training after an ankle injury but is still a doubt for the visitors. Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson told BBC Radio Bristol: "We move into Friday after a good performance that was much desired against Wolves. Friday is going to be really, really important. "If we can get a win, it really puts everybody else on the back foot, we'll claw another couple in and hopefully we'll push away as well. "It is a massive game. I'm sure the players will give their all. We want to look ahead of us and make sure we overtake a couple of people, with Forest and Burton only a point ahead of us. "Even QPR, six points ahead of us, if we beat them, we cut that gap to three points. That's really important. The more people we draw into it, the better."	Bristol City remain without midfielder Gary O'Neil (leg), but striker Milan Djuric is back in training.
The Taylors will, we are assured, make "quite an entrance" when they arrive in Albert Square this summer, giving the resident Walfordians "a rude awakening". EastEnders executive producer Sean O'Connor describes them as "noisy and brash" who "lack cash" but "have love and warmth in spades". The announcement has split opinion among fans on the soap's Facebook page, with some worried they are a stereotypical white working-class family and/or a pale imitation of the Millers. Others have said there should be more ethnic minority families instead, or have questioned whether they would be able to afford to live in the East End these days. But some are looking forward to what O'Connor described as their "explosive" impact on Walford life. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

In 2013/14, 99,293 students went to further education colleges, but that fell to 82,818 in 2015/16. The figures have been released by the Department for the Economy (DfE). There was a 15% drop in the number of enrolments at FE colleges over the same period, as some students can be enrolled on more than one course. According to the department, there were 180,825 enrolments at FE colleges in 2013/14, but by 2015/16 that figure had fallen to 153,817. One of the six FE colleges, Belfast Metropolitan College (BMC), had a particularly steep decline in its enrolment in just one year. The number of enrolments at BMC alone fell from 36,685 in 2014/15 to 28,514 in 2015/16 - a decline of 22.3%. When approached to explain why this was the case, they declined to comment. NUS-USI President Fergal McFerran expressed alarm at the "staggering drop" and called on the executive to make a "significant increase in the funding allocation for tertiary education and student financial support in the new budget". The college with the lowest rate of decline was South Eastern Regional College where enrolments fell by 8.3% - from 35,832 in 2013/14 to 32,858 in 2015/16. FE colleges provide a range of courses for a range of learners including: Sources working in the FE sector told the BBC that the decline in enrolments could be down to a range of factors, including budget constraints leading to cuts to courses and staff. In 2015/16 over 400 staff in the FE sector were offered voluntary redundancy. Some also said that leisure, recreational and hobby courses - or non-regulated courses - had been reduced in recent years, leading to a drop in enrolments from life-long learners. The DfE figures indicate that there has been a consequent drop in the number of enrolments to non-regulated courses over the three years. In 2013/14 there were around 39,000 enrolments to recreational courses compared to around 24,500 in 2015/16. This was a result of DfE's 'Further Education Means Business' strategy, which aimed to reduce the number of recreational courses to encourage more "economically focused provision". The chief executive of Colleges NI, Gerry Campbell, said that further education was vital for the future of Northern Ireland's economy. "While there has been a decline in relation to residential and leisure type courses, in many ways over the past two or three years there has been an increasing focus from the colleges and FE sector as a whole to engage more on the provision of economically relevant courses," he said. In a statement the Department of the Economy confirmed that the FE colleges budget had been reduced by Â£10m in 2015/16. However, they said that the enrolment statistics were "largely positive" and showed that an increasing proportion of students were leaving further education with a qualification, meeting the needs of the economy.	There has been a 16% drop in the number of students going to further education colleges in Northern Ireland over the past three years.
Producers of precious metals were particularly hard hit. Analysts blamed falling prices for gold and silver and adverse currency movements. Fresnillo, which owns the world's biggest silver mine, was down 4.5% and Randgold was down 4.2%. "Gold is in no man's land," said Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG Index. He says that investors are concerned that gold could fall below $1,200 dollars an ounce, which would make some gold mines unviable. Gold is currently trading at $1,266 dollars an ounce. In China iron ore prices fell to the lowest level in almost five years, which hit shares in other miners. Rio Tinto fell 0.73% and BHP Billiton was down 0.37%. BP was 2.59% higher. Shares had slumped 6% on Thursday after a US judge found the firm "grossly negligent" over the 2010 oil spill. The ruling has made investors cautious over the firm. "I'm not buying BP here. The ruling opens up the door in the United States to more fines for BP," said Beaufort Securities sales trader Basil Petrides. "The US government has got its knife out for BP and it's sharpening the blade," he said. On the currency markets the euro was trading 0.13% higher, but still below the $1.30 level. It fell below the $1.30 level on Thursday in reaction to a surprise cut in interest rates by the European Central Bank. The Bank also launched a programme to buy private sector debt, in another effort to boost European economies. The pound was down 0.10% against the dollar at $1.6314.	(Close): The FTSE 100 index of leading blue-chip shares closed the day down by 0.36% at 6853.40.
It includes plans to cut red tape, develop infrastructure and make it easier for companies to do business. The launch comes on the eve of Mr Modi's first visit to the US as prime minister. Manufacturing contributes only 15% to India's gross domestic product; authorities want to raise it to 25%. Mr Modi's 'Make in India' campaign comes a day after India sent its homegrown mission to Mars. The Mangalyaan robotic probe, one of the cheapest interplanetary missions ever, was successfully put into the orbit of Mars on Wednesday morning. "Whenever I met [business] people for the last few years they would tell me - we want to shift out... It pained me that people of nation are forced to leave," Mr Modi said while unveiling the campaign in the capital, Delhi. "We do not want any industrialist being forced to leave India. I can say that we have been able to bring about a change in last few months." Mr Modi said India must "increase manufacturing and at the same time ensure that the benefits reach the youth of our nation". A boost to manufacturing will create jobs, increase purchasing power and create a larger market for manufacturers, he added. India has a huge pool of talented people, Mr Modi said, adding that it was because of this talent that India was able to send the indigenously-built Mangalyaan to the orbit of Mars. Mr Modi won the recent general election, promising to revive India's slowing economy and in the three months to June, the country's economy grew by 5.7% , its fastest pace in two-and-a-half years.	Prime Minister Narendra Modi has launched an ambitious campaign which aims to turn the country into a global manufacturing hub.
A young palaeontologist working with the University of Manchester found the fossil in 2008, in the collections of Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery. He realised it was the 189-million-year-old remains of an ichthyosaur - an extinct marine reptile. Further study confirmed it to be a previously unknown species. The finding has now been published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. Dean Lomax, the 25-year-old palaeontologist who studied the specimen, said it was so well preserved he could determine the contents of its stomach. "We could see tiny hook-shaped features that were actually the hooks from the tentacles of squid," he said. "So we know what its last meal was." Mr Lomax worked with Prof Judy Massare, from the State University of New York, comparing the specimen's fossilised bones with those of almost 1,000 other ichthyosaurs in museums in the US and Europe. Mr Lomax explained that subtle anatomical features in its fin bones set the species apart from others. It is not uncommon to find ichthyosaur fossils in England. The sharp-toothed marine reptiles swam in large numbers in the seas around Britain when the dinosaurs roamed. This particular specimen was found in the rocks of Dorset's Jurassic Coast in the early 1980s and brought to the museum, so it is not clear how it was eventually mistaken for a copy. Dr Silvia Danise from Plymouth University said its "rediscovery" was a "striking example of how important museum collections are for scientific research". "Collections are treasures that show their value each time we're able to look at them with a different perspective, and by asking new scientific questions," she told BBC News. Dr Blanca Huertas, from the Natural History Museum in London, pointed out that there were still many species to discover in museum collections. "Sometimes we discover things in the field," she said, "but the collections are an incredible source of opportunities, since visiting them, people can study specimens and collections from hundreds of places across the entire planet and travel in time." Source: Encyclopaedia of Paleontology. This new species has now been named Ichthyosaurus anningae - in honour of Mary Anning, the British fossil-hunter who discovered the first ichthyosaur on the Dorset coast in about 1811. The hope now is that news about the significance of this ancient specimen might help track down the fossil hunter who found it. Dr Stephen Brusatte, a palaeontologist from the University of Edinburgh added that there was "a whole lot more still to find out there". He told BBC News: "Palaeontology is a unique science because you don't need an advanced degree or specialised training to find a fossil, just patience and a keen set of eyes."	A fossil stored in a Doncaster museum for 30 years and thought to be a plaster copy has turned out to be a new species of ancient reptile.
The Mediterranean gull and black-headed gull eggs were illegally harvested from from islands in Poole Harbour, Dorset. The theft has been branded "sickening" by bird charity Birds of Poole Harbour. The group said some eggs - sometimes eaten as a delicacy - were not cleared for human consumption. Dorset Police and Natural England have launched an investigation. Natural England is urging any restaurants or pubs to ask to see a valid licence before buying eggs to prepare in meals. Birds of Poole Harbour had been surveying a group of islands in the harbour when the theft was discovered. Mediterranean gulls are classified as a Schedule One species, meaning anyone disturbing their nests must have a special licence. Paul Morton, who runs the charity, said Mediterranean gulls' eggs were not approved for human consumption, and could be a "health issue". "I'm distraught, really. To see the taking of hundreds and hundreds of eggs from an important colony is quite sickening," he said. Mr Moreton said there had been previous convictions for egg poaching in the last 10 or 15 years. He said continued monitoring was needed to understand the effect on the gull population in the harbour, which he said had fallen by 70% since 2008.	Hundreds of eggs belonging to a protected species of bird have been stolen from an important nesting site, with fears they could be sold to the restaurant industry.
In the year to the end of March, 57 victims of homicide (murders and culpable homicides) were recorded - down five on the previous 12 months. This is the lowest number of recorded homicide cases for a single 12-month period since 1976 and half the figure of nine years ago. As of 31 March 2016, only one case of homicide recorded in 2015-16 was unresolved. The report Homicide in Scotland showed that a sharp instrument remained the most common method of killing in Scotland and accounted for 51% of homicides (29 cases) in 2015-16. Nearly all of these cases (26 out of 29) involved a knife. While the majority of the accused had an unknown status for alcohol and drugs, 31% (20 people) were identified by the police as being under the influence of alcohol or alcohol and drugs. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said: "While it is encouraging to see continued falls in homicide cases alongside the long-term decline in violent crime, the sustained efforts that have helped achieve this - through education and enforcement - must continue, because each of the lives lost is one life too many. "There is a clear role across a range of public services, in addition to the critical work of our police, to continue to support communities that may remain at risk from violent crime and to challenge irresponsible attitudes both to alcohol misuse and to so-called 'casual' violence. "We will continue to work with partners and invest in a range of projects to help steer our young people away from the risks of a life of violence and crime, while also ensuring our law enforcement agencies and the courts have the powers and resources needed to deal with those who do harm to others." Scottish Labour's justice spokeswoman Claire Baker said: "Whilst I welcome the overall downward trend in homicides in Scotland we have to take these statistics with a note of caution. "Last year when the Scottish government were heralding 'record low' homicide figures after a supposed similar drop, the actual figures were being revised upwards to show an increase. "Meanwhile, sexual crime in Scotland sits at a 45-year high and in the past year we have seen an increase in violent crime with attempted murder and serious assault rising by a staggering 27%." The number of homicide victims for 2014-15 stood at 59 last year but later increased to 62, after three cases were reclassified following deaths.	The number of murders in Scotland has fallen again, according to new figures.
Charli XCX, Ella Eyre and Lianne La Havas will appear alongside The Chemical Brothers and Underworld. Other festivals have been criticised for the lack of women on their bills. Last week, music blog Crack in the Road posted images of edited posters removing all the names of male performers. The rather blank-looking page was shared on social media, with the bills at Reading and Leeds, Download and T in the Park also a focus for criticism. Neneh Cherry, Andreya Triana and Radio 1 DJ B.Traits are among other female acts to be announced by Bestival. Organiser Rob da Bank said: "There are shed-loads of amazing people making some startlingly good music at the moment and look, lots of them are female." This year's Bestival theme is Summer of Love. It takes place at Robin Hill Country Park on the Isle of Wight between 10 and 13 September, with 25 stages on offer. Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube	Bestival has revealed an all-female line-up in its second wave of announcements for this year's Isle of Wight event.
Commanders lowered the flag during a ceremony in Kabul - raising the flag of the new mission named Resolute Support. "We have lifted the Afghan people out of the darkness of  despair and given them hope for the future," mission commander Gen John  Campbell said. Nato's Afghan deployment began after the 9/11 attacks against the US. From 1 January the alliance's role will shift to a mainly training and support mission for the Afghan army. Sunday's ceremony was low-key - held inside a gymnasium at the alliance headquarters away from the public. A military band played as the flag of the International Security and Assistance Force (Isaf) was lowered in the presence of senior military personnel from both sides. Unfurling the new flag, Gen Campbell said the mission "will serve as the bedrock of an enduring partnership" between Nato and Afghanistan. "We honour coalition and Afghan fallen in this mighty struggle, those who paid the price for Afghanistan's freedom," he said, adding: "The road before us remains challenging but we will triumph." At its peak, the US-led Isaf deployment involved more than 130,000 personnel from 50 countries. But from 1 January, it will bring together around 12,000 men and women from Nato allies and 14 partner nations. "The security of Afghanistan will be fully in the hands of the country's 350,000 Afghan soldiers and police. But Nato allies, together with many partner nations, will remain to train, advise and assist them," said Nato Secretary General  Jens Stoltenberg in a statement. More than a decade after this long and expensive mission began, the Taliban are still active and gaining in strength, launching a number of attacks in recent months, says the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Kabul. This year has been the bloodiest in Afghanistan since 2001, with at least 4,600 members of the Afghan security forces dying in the fight against the Taliban. It underscores the challenges that lie ahead of the Afghan security forces, our correspondent says. Nearly 3,500 foreign troops have been killed since the beginning of the Nato mission.	Nato has formally ended its 13-year combat mission in Afghanistan - heralding the start of a new phase of support for local Afghan troops.
Two reports, published in November, criticised the regulator at the time for failing to take action. One of those reports, by barrister Andrew Green QC, said regulators should consider banning 10 former HBOS executives. A new investigation has now been announced by regulators. "The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) have decided to start investigations into certain former HBOS senior managers," the regulators said. "These investigations will determine whether or not any prohibition proceedings should be commenced against them. The FCA and PRA continue to review materials with a view to making further decisions regarding other former HBOS senior managers." No details are being given as to the exact nature of the investigations, who is being investigated, or the timeframe of the inquiry. A Bank of England/FCA report examined the failure of HBOS, while Mr Green examined decisions taken by the Financial Services Authority, the City regulator at the time of the HBOS demise. Both were published in November. So far the only person to have been banned is Peter Cummings, who was previously the head of corporate lending at HBOS. In 2012, he was fined Â£500,000, and banned from senior positions in banking. In his report, Mr Green suggested that the Bank of England's PRA and the FCA should consider prohibition proceedings against former executives. That included Andy Hornby, HBOS chief executive from 2006 to 2009. Mr Green said the FSA was "misguided" when it took the decision not to take action against Mr Hornby. Other former HBOS executives named in the report included Lord Stevenson, and Mike Ellis, the former group finance director at HBOS. Lindsay Mackay, the head of HBOS's Treasury division from 2004, could also be banned, November's report said. James Crosby, HBOS chief executive from 2001 to 2006, has retired. He gave up his knighthood in 2009, and surrendered part of his pension. Eight former non-executive directors of HBOS were criticised in the report, although they said they disagreed with its findings. The eight, including Lord Stevenson and Carphone Warehouse founder Sir Charles Dunstone, said the report had downplayed the "unforeseeable" effects of the financial crisis.	Regulators are to begin investigations into senior managers at HBOS, the bank which collapsed during the financial crisis.
Knox, 30, has arranged a practice round at Augusta with the 1988 winner. "It's not every tournament you have a fellow Scot and past champion to show you around," Knox told BBC Scotland. "I'm looking forward to it and hopefully he'll give me some great insider tips that he's learned over the years that might help me." Lyle, 58, qualifies as a winner of the Green Jacket, and US-based Knox is the only other Scotsman in the field. Inverness-born Knox leapt up the rankings in November with victory at WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai and is currently No.34 in the world. "I still can't quite believe I'm playing at the Masters," he enthused. "Growing up watching it on TV, now it's my turn to play. It's truly an amazing honour." Knox has had a taste of the other majors, finishing in a tie for 45th at the US Open in 2013, featuring at the US PGA Championship in 2014 and 2015 and making his Open debut as a reserve at St Andrews last year. "I've only been to Augusta once before," explained Knox, one of British golf's most promising players. "It's the most famous course in the world pretty much. Obviously, St Andrews is right up there too. "Being the first major of the year and with all the history, Augusta just has this hype around it and golf is in a great place right now with so many young, amazing players. "There's such a buzz around the tournament. The crowds seem amazing and then there's the condition of the course. "The whole thing is magical, a golfer's dream, and I can't wait to be a part of it."	Russell Knox aims to tap into the experience of former champion Sandy Lyle as he prepares to make his Masters debut next week.
They said they had received an anonymous threat, two days after the killing of five police officers. A nearby parking lot was searched for a "suspicious person" but no-one was found. SWAT officers were earlier deployed at the main building. On Thursday, five white police officers were shot dead by a black man, Micah Johnson, during a protest rally. The march was against the killing of black men by police. Two deaths this week have led to nationwide protests. Dallas police said its officers - using dogs - searched the parking lot but the hunt turned up nothing. In a statement earlier on Saturday, the police said: "The Dallas Police Department received an anonymous threat against law enforcement across the city and has taken precautionary measures to heighten security." An armoured vehicle was moved close to the main HQ in central Dallas and heavily armed officers were seen nearby, according to the Associated Press news agency. But it added that members of the public were still able to walk about freely around the building. The police asked media to stop all live feeds around HQ "for the safety of our officers", the BBC's James Cook reports. The shooting happened late on Thursday during the protest march. Johnson, who was himself killed during the assault, supported black militant groups who encouraged violence against police. Dallas police chief David Brown said Johnson had told a negotiator that he had wanted to kill white people, especially white police officers, because he was angry about the recent shootings of black men by police. The attack came after the police killings of Philando Castile in Minnesota and Alton Sterling in Louisiana. Earlier on Saturday, President Barack Obama said the US was "not as divided as some have suggested" in the wake of the shootings involving African-Americans. He said Americans of "all races, all backgrounds", including many of those who were protesting, were outraged by the Dallas killings. As well as the five police officers killed, another seven were injured on Thursday. Two civilians were also hurt. Johnson, 25, who officials say acted alone, was killed by remotely detonated explosives that were sent into a car park where he had taken refuge after the shootings. He was a member of the US Army Reserve from 2009 to 2015 who had served in Afghanistan. Bomb-making material, rifles and a combat journal were found in his home in the Dallas suburb of Mesquite. A number of gun attacks involving police officers and civilians have occurred in other parts of the US in the aftermath of the deaths in Minnesota and Louisiana. Leaders of the Black Lives Matter organisation have condemned the Dallas killings but say planned marches, including a "Weekend of Rage" in Philadelphia, will go ahead.	Dallas police have given the all clear, hours after security levels were raised at their headquarters in the city.
A row has broken out after Mr Gill attacked Neil Hamilton for offering support on the £1.1bn M4 relief road. Mr Gill denies it was the group's view, but Mr Hamilton said his colleague was late for the meeting where it was agreed. The MEP said he is fully involved in all of his jobs. Meanwhile UKIP has handed out spokespeople roles to all of its AMs - with the exception of Mr Gill. Mr Hamilton became leader of the UKIP group in May despite Mr Gill being and remaining Wales party leader. "UKIP members expect all UKIP AMs to be fully committed to their role in the Senedd and to be team players," said Mr Hamilton. "If Nathan cannot accept this, he should fulfil his commitment to the UKIP NEC (national executive committee) and Nigel Farage last January that he would not 'double-job'." The AM for Mid and West Wales added: "Nathan Gill is a part-time AM at the moment because he has not resigned from his job as an MEP in Brussels and Strasbourg. "He arrived late at our group meeting yesterday, when it was nearly over, so he missed our discussion about the M4. "He has at no time expressed any misgivings to me." Mr Hamilton told the assembly on Wednesday that UKIP was prepared to back the preferred relief road option of First Minister Carwyn Jones, a £1.1bn new motorway known as the black route. He said: "We think the black route is better than no route, and so if this is necessary to unblock the logjam we are prepared to play our part in it." Mr Hamilton said his statement in the assembly had been endorsed by everyone present at the group meeting, where the issue was "fully discussed" and had the backing of UKIP South Wales East AM David Rowlands, who will speak for the party on transport. UKIP's election manifesto said it did not agree with the black route plan "due to its excessive £1bn plus cost" - backing instead the "blue route" scheme to upgrade Newport roads. On Thursday, Mr Gill told BBC Wales: "Giving Carwyn false hope that he's going to get the black route through is not the right thing to do." He added: "We back the blue route. That is our manifesto position." Asked if Mr Hamilton's comments represented a group position, Mr Gill said: "No." He has previously said he would stand down from the European role but is yet to do so, with suggestions he would wait until after the EU poll on 23 June. Mr Gill, who is the only AM who is an MEP, later said in response to Mr Hamilton: "What evidence does he have that I am a part time AM? "I am fully involved in all of my jobs and I am doing everything I am supposed to be doing." He said that the other two AMs in the UKIP European election list, who could take the job after he stands down, are now AMs themselves. "We always said all along that we wouldn't do anything until after the referendum," he said. A spokesman for Mr Gill said: "Nathan has attended every major function that has gone on in the assembly since he was elected. "His comments on the M4 route were simply fulfilling his manifesto promise and his commitment to the A55 in North Wales." Mark Reckless, AM for South Wales East, said the matter had been discussed at a UKIP group meeting. "We continue to support the blue route - we prefer that to the black route," Mr Reckless said. But he added: "As Neil said yesterday, it's crucial that we get the M4 relief road and we would be happy for negotiations with government in respect of the black route. "If they were willing to abolish the Severn Bridge tolls, I feel that is a deal that might be attractive." Meanwhile UKIP has announced the following AMs as its spokespeople: Asked why Mr Gill was left off the list of UKIP assembly spokespeople, Mr Hamilton said: "When he has finally made his decision about which job he prefers and if he remains an AM, I will happily look at appointing him as a spokesman. "Providing of course, he is prepared to abide by collective responsibility."	The leader of the UKIP Welsh Assembly group says Nathan Gill should not "double job" as both MEP and AM if he cannot fully commit to Cardiff Bay.
The family of Joseph Mulhern, who was shot by the IRA in 1993, believe his death will feature in the inquiry, but they are bitterly divided over whether or not it should even take place. Mr Mulhern met a lonely, untimely death in July 1993. The 23-year-old was abducted and shot by the IRA, who alleged he was a police informer. His body was found on a remote hillside on the border between counties Tyrone and Donegal, dressed in a blue boiler suit and his hands tied with cable. Those were the tell-tale signs that he had been tortured before he was shot. For a long period during Northern Ireland's Troubles, Stakeknife was running the IRA's internal security unit, otherwise known as the 'nutting squad'. Stakeknife has been been named by the media as Freddie Scappaticci. But the west Belfast man denies the allegation. The secret agent is to be investigated in connection with the murders of up to 50 people. It is an inquiry that Joseph Mulhern's father Frank fully supports. "Stakeknife was employed by the state," he said. "Stakeknife knew when a lot of these murders were going to take place. "He obviously reported to his handlers and they did nothing to stop these murders. "The IRA have pulled the trigger but the state authorities could have prevented it as they would have known about it a number of weeks before [Joseph] was taken away. "Why did they not act?" But that is not the view of the entire family. One of those who carried Joseph Mulhern's coffin was his younger brother Fran, then aged 18. Not long afterwards, he left Belfast to study law in England and settled there. He feels the Stakeknife inquiry is focusing on the wrong people. He said: "The thing that I feel is really strange is that everyone is talking about Scappaticci, but ultimately what about the people who actually pulled the triggers? "It just seems like they are getting a free pass. "So, to me, the whole thing just smacks of being almost this inquiry to use as a political football to beat the British government with." Asked if he would welcome an inquiry that could shed light on what happened to his brother, he replied: "No, because it is not going to bring my brother back. "It keeps dragging up the past," he said. "And the second thing it does, is its just money that Northern Ireland does not have." It has been suggested the inquiry could cost Â£5m a year for five years. But those who have argued for it, like Joseph Mulhern's father Frank, say that figure has been deliberately inflated. "That sum has been mentioned, probably by the state authorities here, to try to make up excuses why they should not have an investigation," Frank Mulhern said. "They don't need to spent Â£35m because they have all their information and files in Castlereagh or Whitehall or wherever they keep their files." Fran Mulhern said he believes the way the government is dealing with past - by holding inquiries into some deaths but not others  - is not only unfair but is hampering political progress and reconciliation. "Either you provide something for all of the victims or you deal with none of them," he said. "You can't cherry-pick, and for me that is the big problem. "It seems to be we are going to look at this, but we are not going to look at that. "The young girl who lost her dad because he was in the [Royal Ulster Constabulary] and was killed by a mortar bomb has every bit as much right as someone who lost a family member at Loughgall or wherever. "Picking and choosing creates resentment and it doesn't allow the province to move on." Fran Mulhern lives in the north of England and rarely returns to Belfast. He is the only remaining male sibling in his family. The archive television footage of Joseph's funeral shows younger brother Liam, then aged eight, carrying a single red rose behind the coffin. By the time he was 15, Liam Mulhern was on remand accused of offences linked to the Continuity IRA. He was later jailed for dissident republican activities and died two years ago after taking ill in Maghaberry Prison. The two Mulhern brothers are buried in Belfast's City Cemetery beside their mother who died when they were children.	The activities of the army's most high-ranking agent, codenamed Stakeknife, are to be investigated but a date for the inquiry has yet to be set.
Ormsby had already agreed to join Giants for the 2017 season, having made two appearances during a one-month loan spell with the club in April. The 23-year-old scored 29 tries in 42 games for Warrington, but played in only five games this season. "I wanted to get game time, so it's good for my career to be here," he told Huddersfield's club website.	Warrington winger Gene Ormsby has joined Super League rivals Huddersfield Giants with immediate effect.
The 27-year-old has agreed a three-year contract with Sarries and will move to Allianz Park this summer. Clark made his Premiership debut aged 18 for Leeds in 2007 and he has won one international cap for England, which came against France in August 2015. "Calum is a very talented player and will fit in brilliantly here," Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall said. "He is still a player with a huge amount of potential and in our opinion he has his best years ahead of him." Clark is Saracens' third signing for the 2017-18 season, after the announcements Wales international Liam Williams and Toulouse hooker Christopher Tolofua will join the European and Premiership champions.	Saracens have agreed a deal to sign flanker Calum Clark from fellow Premiership side Northampton Saints.
Ross-shire Engineering has secured the potential investment across the next five years supplying equipment to Scottish Water. The firm in Muir of Ord has already created 100 new jobs to allow it meet the needs of the utility company. The investment has also provided additional job security to the existing 273 staff members. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the company's premises near Inverness on Monday, following a tour of Nigg Energy Park on the Cromarty Firth. She said: "Ensuring a strong rural economy is crucial to Scotland's success. "This funding Ross-Shire Engineering has secured provides a hugely welcome boost in providing skilled jobs and investment across the Highlands, as well as providing vital utility services to Scotland's homes and businesses. "In particular, I am delighted they will be investing in their already strong apprenticeship job programme, providing vital training and employment to young people living in the Highlands in a competitive jobs market." The first minister added: "Last week when I set out my Programme for Government I promised to protect Scotland's interests, particularly our economic interests, in the wake of the EU referendum. "Driving sustainable economic growth is at the heart of that, and I am committed to ensuring this government does all it can to ensure Scotland's rural economy remains prosperous for future generations."	Funding of up to £200m has helped create new jobs at a Highlands engineering company.
Gillian Triggs told a senate committee that she had been asked to resign and offered a new role. The shadow attorney general has written to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) seeking an immediate investigation. The HRC released a report condemning the treatment of children in detention. Their report said that detaining children of asylum seekers violated international human rights law, and called for their release. Speaking to journalists in Sydney on Wednesday, Mr Abbott repeated his earlier statements that the government had lost confidence in Ms Triggs as president of the HRC. "What she does is a matter for her," said Mr Abbott in response to a question about whether she should resign. "As the secretary of the Attorney General's Department has made clear, she was not asked to resign and no inducement has been offered." On Tuesday, Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott launched a scathing attack on the HRC report, saying that it was a "political stitch-up". Earlier in a senate hearing, Ms Triggs said that she had been asked to resign during a meeting on 3 February by the secretary of Attorney General George Brandis' department. "I rejected it out of hand," she said, as quoted by ABC News. Ms Triggs told the hearing that the department's secretary, Chris Moraitis, had said that she would be offered another job with the government. She added that she had been "very shaken and shocked" by the "disgraceful proposal" and had reminded Mr Moraitis that she had a five-year statutory position. In a letter to the AFP commissioner, Shadow Attorney General Mark Dreyfus said: "The attorney general's offer to an independent statutory officer of an inducement to resign her position as president, with the object of affecting the leadership of the [HRC] to avoid political damage to the Abbott government may constitute corrupt and unlawful conduct." ABC News reported that Mr Dreyfus said that Ms Triggs preferred not to use the term "inducement" but that she had made it clear that the resignation request and the offer of a job had been connected. Local media reported that Mr Moraitis has denied asking Ms Triggs to resign but said they had discussed the possibility of her taking on another role. The attorney general admitted to the senate committee that he had lost confidence in Ms Triggs because of the timing of the inquiry into detained children, according to local media. He added that "as a matter of goodwill" he had told Mr Moraitis that he hoped that she could be encouraged to serve the government in other capacities. The HRC report, entitled The Forgotten Children, was published earlier in February. It said a third of detained children had developed mental illnesses of such severity that they required psychiatric treatment. The number of children in detention has fallen under Mr Abbott's government. He has questioned why the HRC did not launch an inquiry when the Labor government was in power and there were almost 2,000 children in detention centres. Successive Australian governments have been criticised over their harsh asylum policies, under which asylum seekers are detained for long periods in offshore camps while their applications are processed.	Australia's opposition Labor Party has asked police to investigate whether the government tried to induce the president of the Australian Human Rights Commission (HRC) to resign.
The US network said it was "not an easy decision" and had "enormous respect" for its creators and cast. Set in the 1970s, the series told of a charismatic record executive trying to revive his struggling label. Its ensemble cast included Bobby Cannavale in the lead role, Olivia Wilde as his wife and Sir Mick's son James as a rebellious British singer. Sir Mick and Scorsese were among the show's executive producers, with the latter directing its pilot episode. The series premiere in February was watched by 764,000 viewers, though the average audience subsequently dipped to 650,000. "After careful consideration, we have decided not to proceed with a second season of Vinyl," HBO said in a statement. "We have enormous respect for the creative team and cast for their hard work and passion on this project." Ray Romano, another actor in the cast, told an Australian newspaper on Thursday the cancellation felt like "a knife in the guts". Wilde, meanwhile, thanked her Twitter followers for their "kind words" and said she had been part of "something special".	Sir Mick Jagger and Martin Scorsese's music business-based drama Vinyl has been cancelled by HBO after one season.
Both sides had chances before the Pars' Ryan Wallace drilled a low shot into the bottom corner with 15 minutes left. The lead last just two minutes as Ross Davidson got the last touch on a free-kick into the area. The home side dominated the closing stages but could could not deny Rovers, who remain in fifth place. Rovers remain level with Airdrieonians, who drew at home with Forfar Athletic.	Scottish League One leaders Dunfermline Athletic were held at home by Albion Rovers but still moved 11 points clear at the top of the table.
Pupils aged 11 will be expected to know their tables up to 12x12, and will be tested using an "on-screen check". The checks will be piloted to about 3,000 pupils in 80 primary schools this summer, before being rolled out across the country in 2017. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said maths was a non-negotiable aspect of a good education. The "on-screen check" examination will involve children completing multiplication challenges against the clock, which will be scored instantly. The Department for Education says it is the first use of on-screen technology in National Curriculum tests. Ms Morgan has also said teachers will be judged by the results of the tests: "Since 2010, we've seen record numbers of 11 year olds start secondary school with a good grasp of the three Rs. But some continue to struggle. "That is why, as part of our commitment to extend opportunity and deliver educational excellence everywhere we are introducing a new check to ensure that all pupils know their times tables by age 11. "They will help teachers recognise those pupils at risk of falling behind and allow us to target those areas where children aren't being given a fair shot to succeed." In 2015, 80% of Year 6 pupils achieved Level 4 in maths, reading and writing, up from 78% last year. But Labour says standards are being threatened by a shortage of teachers, and in the past some teaching unions have warned additional tests can place unwelcome pressure on teachers and pupils.	Every pupil in England will be tested on their times tables before leaving primary school, under government plans.
Scotland Yard said the 37-year-old was held at his home address under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Officers from the Metropolitan Police are searching the property. He has been taken to a south London police station and is being questioned by officers from the counter terrorism command unit.	A man has been arrested in north-west London on suspicion of involvement in production of improvised explosive devices in Iraq in 2007.
Police say the individuals were using software designed to remotely control computers - allowing for the stealing of information. The other arrests were made in Estonia, France, Romania, Latvia, Italy, and Norway. The practice, which in some instances can grant access to a victim's webcam, is known as "Ratting". The phrase takes its name from the malicious software used to gain control - Remote Access Trojans (Rats). Using Rats to view people through their own webcams, without their knowledge, is becoming "increasingly common" according to the UK government-backed Get Safe Online advice website. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said it arrested two 33-year-old men, and a 30-year-old woman, in Leeds. A 20-year-old man was arrested in Chatham, Kent, while a 19-year-old man had his home searched in Liverpool and was brought in for "voluntary questioning". They are all accused of knowingly using Rats to spy on multiple targets. "Victims are typically infected by being convinced to click on a link purporting to be a picture or video, or disguised as a legitimate file, but is instead an installer for the Rat," the NCA explained in a statement. "In many cases, those who unwittingly install such trojans will have no indication that their machine is infected." Source: ChildNet International and Ceop As well as the arrests, the NCA said it was warning other users that the software was illegal, and its use would result in further action. "The illegal use of Remote Access Trojans is a significant cybercrime threat, demanding this kind of strong, co-ordinated response from international to local UK level," said Andy Archibald, deputy director of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit. "Suspected users of Rats are continuing to find that, despite having no physical contact or interaction with their victims, they can still be identified, tracked down and arrested by the NCA and its partners." An investigation by BBC Radio 5 live in June last year looked into the growing problem of Ratting. One victim, student Rachel Hyndman, told the station: "I was sitting in the bath, trying to relax, and suddenly someone potentially has access to me in this incredibly private moment and it's horrifying. "To have it happen to you without your consent is horribly violating." The investigation uncovered websites where hackers share pictures and videos of their victims.

NHS England guidelines say that 85% of patients should wait a maximum of 62 days to begin their first treatment following referral from their GP. But figures show this slipped to 84.4% from January to March this year. Charities Cancer Research UK and Macmillan Cancer Support both said it was a worrying sign. The target for treating people diagnosed with cancer within 62 days fell from 85.8% during the previous quarter to 84.4% in the first three months of 2014. Mike Hobday, director of policy and research at Macmillan Cancer Support, said the number of trusts missing this target had doubled over the last year. "This is a clear warning sign that the NHS is under huge strain. "The UK already has some of the worst cancer survival rates in Europe. "More patients are now facing delays, which means more patients are facing anxiety for longer and more lives are being put at risk. "We're very worried that the coordination of cancer care is getting worse and that cancer is being overlooked in the new NHS." He said cancer patients were set to increase from two million to three million by 2020. Sarah Woolnough, executive director of policy and information at Cancer Research UK, said some patients were being failed. "The breach of the '62 day target' is very concerning, particularly as four in 10 of those who aren't treated within two months are having to wait three months or more. "These targets exist to encourage swift diagnosis of cancer and access to treatment, which is vital to improve survival rates. "Patients want confidence that suspected cancer is taken seriously and prioritised by the NHS. We hope urgent action will be taken to ensure this breach is a one off." Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer for NHS England, said work must be done to make sure standards are met. "It is vital cancer patients are diagnosed and treated quickly so they have the best possible chance of recovery," he said. "Latest figures show nationally the NHS has met and exceeded seven out of eight cancer waiting time standards. But there is variation in meeting the challenging standards, and national performance against one of the targets has dipped." He said clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were working with local providers in areas where the standard is not being met to ensure patients are treated quickly. Other figures released by NHS England on cancer waiting times showed the number of people seen by a specialist within two weeks of an urgent GP referral for suspected cancer also dropped from 95.6% to 95%. For people urgently referred for breast symptoms, where cancer is not suspected, 93.9% are being seen within two weeks, compared to 95.5% previously. The target is 93%. In total, 60,425 patients with breast symptoms where cancer was not initially suspected were seen in the first three months of this year after being urgently referred.	A key government target for treating people diagnosed with suspected cancer has been breached for the first time since it was introduced in 2009.
The incident was reported near junction 16 at Johnstonebridge at about 14:20. Police said that six vehicles had been involved and lanes on the southbound carriageway were blocked for a time but the route was subsequently cleared. In another incident a car was reported to have ended up on its roof on the northbound carriageway. It follows a string of incidents on the motorway on Sunday in similar weather conditions. Policing units attended about 40 crashes - primarily on the A74(M) - throughout the day. A number were also reported on the A75 near Carrutherstown. "Thankfully the majority of the crashes were fairly minor in nature and as a result there were only three persons slightly injured," said a police spokesman. "The crashes occurred as a result of freak hail showers in various locations throughout the region making driving conditions hazardous. "Please remember that although it is now March and temperatures are generally higher, weather conditions are still very changeable so please take time to have a look at the weather forecast prior to your journey so that you may be better informed of the conditions ahead."	A multi-vehicle crash has taken place during a heavy hail shower on the A74(M) after a spate of incidents in similar conditions on Sunday.
Network Rail said it would provide Twitter updates of engineers installing new freight lines over Easter weekend. But Railway Magazine said the firm's PR team had gone into overdrive after work overran during the festive period leading to heavy criticism. The rail firm said they would "definitely have a story to tell". Major work, including extensive signalling improvements, is being carried out on the route from Good Friday to Easter Monday. Patrick Hallgate, from Network Rail, said: "We are acutely aware that some of our work could inconvenience those who want to travel over the Easter period. "Which is why we want to be open and provide the public with live information about how we are using this time to make improvements to this part of the network." Railway Magazine assistant editor Nick Brodrick said this live feed is a result of "the embarrassing fallout caused by the delayed engineering works on the East Coast Main Line after Christmas". He said: "It is therefore not surprising to see its PR team go into overdrive to reassure passengers that it can deliver on its promises." He added that following the minutiae of rail engineering works would not be a popular pastime this Easter. "Most people won't be particularly interested in the nuts and bolts of the work involved; what they expect is a better train service as a result." The improvement work can be followed on Twitter from Friday morning via @networkrailgwrm and the hashtag #greaterwest.	A social media feed of rail works at Reading is due to the "embarrassing fallout" of engineering delays at Christmas, it has been claimed.
The first of six boxes was unveiled on Tottenham Court Road this week. The service is free to use although users will be shown adverts as they wait for their phone to charge. Many of the UK's red telephone boxes have largely fallen into disuse although some are being revived as libraries or being fitted with medical equipment. The boxes have had a makeover for the project - painted green and fitted with a roof-mounted 86cm solar panel. Inside there are a variety of charging stations for different models of phone and a screen which shows adverts. The advertising screen is reinforced to deter vandals and the boxes are maintained daily and locked overnight. The project was the brainchild of two geography students turned entrepreneurs Harold Craston and Kirsty Kenny. Both studied at the London School of Economics (LSE) and were interested in finding new ways to use public spaces. "I lived next to a phone box in my second year at uni and walked past it every day. I thought, 'There are 8,000 of these lying unused in London and we must be able to find a use for them,'" explained Mr Craston. The solarbox can charge up to 100 phones a day, offering a 20% battery boost in 10 minutes. Since launch, about six people per hour use the booth, according to the founder. Running out of battery is a perennial problem for smartphone users as they become ever more powerful without an equivalent technology leap in battery life. "On launch day, my phone ran out of battery and I genuinely had to use the box," said Mr Craston. Solarbox won second place in the Mayor of London's Low Carbon Entrepreneur of the Year Award earlier this year and also won the LSE's Emerging Entrepreneur of the Year award. Five more boxes will be rolled out by April 2015. Funded by advertising, the founders are keen to make sure users are engaged by "short, fun and exciting ads showing exclusive content". Firms signed up include Tinder and Uber, and 30% of advertising space is reserved for community projects.	Disused phone boxes in London are being put to a novel use - as solar-powered charging stations for mobile phones.
The sell-out event brought 75,000 people from around the world to see a spectacular fireworks and laser show bring in 2017. The Edinburgh celebrations claim to be the UK's largest outdoor winter festival celebrations. Entertainers performing for the crowds included Paolo Nutini, The Charlatans, Fatherson and Be Charlotte. Al Thomson, the director of organisers Unique Events, said: "What a great night. Paolo Nutini rocked the Concert in the Gardens, and revellers across the street party enjoyed a superb line-up across the four stages. "What a great way to start 2017, the 70th anniversary of Edinburgh becoming a world-leading festival city." Preliminary figures from Police Scotland indicated there were only two arrests for minor offences. The Edinburgh events are estimated to be worth more than £40m to the Scottish economy. Members of the public were allowed back on to Calton Hill this year after a ban over safety fears was lifted. Council officials decided to shut the city landmark for six hours over the bells last year saying "the hill was unlit and uneven under foot". However, the City of Edinburgh Council decided to do a U-turn following a review of last year's events. Some fireworks were also fired from the hill as part of the midnight display. More than 1,000 hours of planning goes into delivering the Midnight Moment at Edinburgh's Hogmanay Street Party, widely regarded as the UK's most intense six minutes of fireworks. There is 8km of wire connecting up to 94 modules, each with 32 cues, to deliver the 2.6 tonnes of fireworks up to 300m above the Edinburgh skyline. They are fired by 14 pyrotechnicians from Titanium Fireworks. There were more than 10,000 shots and stars in every firework colour.

They are fired by 14 pyrotechnicians from Titanium Fireworks. There were more than 10,000 shots and stars in every firework colour. Nearly 10 tonnes of equipment were used, filling three lorries and five vans. A team of more than 25 people from Titanium Fireworks, Unique Events and Historic Scotland worked into the night to clear, in eight hours, what took five days to set up. All the empty cardboard tubes will be recycled - enough to fill three large skips - as well as a metre square crate with igniter wire. The Hogmanay celebrations followed a torchlight procession from The Mound to Calton Hill on Friday.	Organisers of Edinburgh's Hogmanay have described the event as a "major success".
Imagine a situation where most people with a common condition are undiagnosed and where opportunities are repeatedly missed to identify the problem and to offer good care. What is this condition? It's dying. Each year, an estimated 92,000 people in England are believed to need end of life care but not receive it. As a practising GP I have seen distressed relatives after a patient has died in hospital. Often they have not had a chance to see their relative before they died and were unaware of the seriousness of the condition, despite repeated admissions with deteriorating conditions. Many such patients are never formally identified as at risk of dying and not assessed for end of life care. One relative said something that haunts me to this day: "I wish the doctors had told me that my mother was dying." As a result too many people still die in distress with uncontrolled symptoms, or have futile interventions when this will not make any difference. All of us, including doctors, must do more to talk about dying. A new ComRes research for the Dying Matters Coalition confirms there is a widespread reluctance to talk about dying and death. That is why we want to encourage people to talk more openly about dying and bereavement and to make plans around end-of-life care. Most people have not made a plan of their choices and wishes in the event of a serious illness. People often think there is plenty of time when the situation arises but often this is not the case and it can be too late. Doctors are trained to cure, but as people live with long-term conditions, the medical profession needs to change how it works with dying patients. We need to bring dying back into people's homes, rather than in hospital, care homes or hospices. As increasing numbers of people develop and live with dementia, it is vital that doctors talk about the kind of end-of-life care people would choose, while people are healthy. There's a huge change required in our culture, starting with the medical profession. Having learnt a lot from the Canadian communications expert Prof Stephen Workman, I would urge doctors to do three things. First, be compassionate but direct when talking about dying. Doctors speaking to relatives about an ill patient who is giving cause for concern, should not just say "your husband is seriously ill", but should add "It is possible that he could die". This allows all involved to prepare. Secondly, be honest and don't offer false hope. Think twice about offering a false choice of procedures like cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) when someone is actually dying and chances of recovery are minuscule. Instead offer supportive care to keep the patient comfortable and allow them to die a natural dignified death. And, thirdly, when doctors diagnose a serious illness they should ask the patient whether they would like to talk about what they can expect and what is likely to happen. Most people die from frailty in old age, and will be well known to health and social care services. Importantly, this gives opportunities for talking about end of life wishes and advance care planning. My ambition is to reduce the fear of dying and increase knowledge and awareness of palliative care. It is vitally important that every person who is coming to the end of their life is spotted early enough and supported to make a good advance care plan. I know just how hard it is to address issues like this in the frenzy of busy surgeries and wards. But we as doctors need to up our game. All of us, especially doctors can play a part in ensuring everyone is able to have a good death.	In this week's Scrubbing Up opinion column, Prof Mayur Lakhani chair of the Dying Matters Coalition, urges doctors to be more open and frank about preparing patients and their families for the end of life.
The Italy player had reportedly been linked to a reunion with ex-Juve manager Antonio Conte at Chelsea. The 29-year-old joined the Serie A champions from Bari in 2010 and has since made 291 appearances. In that time he has won five consecutive league titles, two Italian cups and reached the Champions League final in 2015.	Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci has signed a contract extension that will keep him at the club until 2021.
The attacker, a 27-year-old Swiss man, also died on Sunday, they said. Five other people were hurt when the man set fire to the train and stabbed passengers in the attack on Saturday. Two of them, including a six-year-old child, are in a serious condition. Police have said that, as yet, there is no indication of a political or terrorist motive for the attack. The attack occurred around 14:20 (12:20 GMT) as the train was approaching Salez station, between the towns of Buchs and Sennwald. Several dozen passengers were on board at the time. In a statement (in German), St Gallen cantonal police said video evidence from inside the train showed the attacker, armed with a knife, pouring out a flammable liquid. Six people - including the attacker - were injured. The seventh injured person was a man on the platform who pulled the burning attacker off the train. Forensic experts are analysing the flammable liquid and the scene of the crime. Police said the attacker lived in a canton adjoining St Gallen. His address has been searched. On the basis of the video evidence, police say the man acted alone.	A 34-year-old woman who was injured in an attack by a knifeman on a Swiss train has died in hospital, police say.
An all-party group has called on the UK government to consider devolving some immigration control. That could involve Wales being able to set its own visas and migration quotas. And the group chairman said immigrants should have to learn English or Welsh. The UK government said different rules for different areas would cause difficulties for employers. Currently, there is no separate Welsh immigration policy. A number of recommendations have made by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Social Integration (APPGSI) report on how the UK's immigration system could promote better integration. It said speaking English was "the key to full participation in our society and economy". Group chairman Chuka Umunna MP said he wanted Wales to have a bigger say in developing immigration policies. "This is a really hot topic, it's become very toxic, very polarised and we want to build a consensus on what a new system could look like," he told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme. When asked if immigrants could learn Welsh if living and working in Wales as an alternative to English, he said: "Absolutely. Why not?", adding that people could not fully integrate in society if they could not speak the language. David Davies, Conservative MP for Monmouth, called it a "ludicrous idea". "People will just go to whichever nation... is offering the easiest visas and move to where they want to move to," he told BBC Wales. "Once they've got a visa to go to Wales there will be nothing to stop them going to England or vice versa." The MPs' report claims the UK's existing points-based immigration system is "generally unresponsive to demographic, economic and cultural differences between our constituent nations and regions". "Shaping immigration criteria to address nation or region-specific economic and cultural needs might instil confidence among members of the public that the immigration system works for their area", the study said. It added: "Enabling nations and regions to set regional immigration quotas would create new incentives for politicians to actively make the case for immigration in their area." Devolution could involve the introduction of region-specific visas, with quotas for how many are issued. Canada is given as an example, where all 10 provincial governments are allowed to set region-specific requirements for immigrants. Immigrants are required to live in the region that approves their visa until they become eligible to apply for Canadian citizenship. The province of Quebec is also able to set its own criteria for its visas and evaluate applications. A small element of regional policy on immigration already exists in the UK, where Scotland has a list of occupations in addition to a UK-wide version where employers can advertise outside of the EU without first advertising domestically. The UK government, the report said, should appoint an independent commission to explore how a devolved or regionally-led immigration system might work. Questions for the commission could include extending existing powers for Scotland to Wales, Northern Ireland, London and the English metro regions, and whether the UK government might copy the Quebec model. A Welsh Government spokesman said: "It is important that the needs of Wales are reflected in future migration policies and that people who settle here are supported to integrate into communities." Plaid Cymru external affairs spokesman Steffan Lewis said: "Plaid Cymru has long advocated a Welsh visa system to boost our public services such as the NHS and support the private sector in attracting high-skilled workers from around the world. "It is also of great regret that Westminster policies have damaged our reputation as a destination for international students. "Student visas should be devolved and would benefit our universities and our economy." A UK government spokeswoman said: "Applying different immigration rules to different parts of the United Kingdom will complicate the immigration system, harming its integrity and causing difficulties for employers who need the flexibility to deploy their staff to other parts of the UK." She said the UK government was rolling out a Â£20m fund for English language provision and had made Â£140m available to councils to manage impacts on communities "caused by issues such as poor English language skills". The spokeswoman added: "We must also recognise that uncontrolled, mass immigration makes it difficult to maintain social cohesion and puts pressure on public services. "Our priority is to build an immigration system that works for everyone in the UK and delivers the control we need."	Immigration rules tailored to the needs of Wales could build public confidence in the system, a group of MPs has said.
Scientists believe the drug, metformin, may mimic the effects of extreme calorie restriction. This regime, which is based on eating a very low calorie diet, is thought to promote healthy ageing. The human implications of the study are unclear, the researchers report in the journal, Nature Communications. Rafael de Cabo, of the National Institute on Ageing in Baltimore, Maryland, US, said calorie restriction in laboratory animals had been shown to increase their lifespan. His team is searching for interventions - such as a drug - that can mimic these effects. Metformin is one of the most widely prescribed treatments for type-2 diabetes, which occurs mainly in people above the age of 40. It is also used to treat metabolic syndrome, a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity. Previous work has shown that metformin can extend the lifespan of simple organisms such as worms, but studies in flies and mammals have given conflicting evidence. The scientists gave one of two different doses of metformin to middle-aged male mice and found that lower doses increased lifespan by about 5%, and also delayed the onset of age-associated diseases. But they said the higher dose of metformin was toxic and reduced the lifespan of mice. Further studies were needed to determine if metformin has any effect on human health and lifespan, said Dr de Cabo. "These are very promising results that need to be translated to humans via clinical studies," he said. He said the best current advice was to eat a good diet and exercise. "Right now the best that we can say is probably what your grandmother told you," he told BBC News. "Eat a good diet and exercise are the only two things that we know for sure that they work very well in humans." Prof Tom Kirkwood, associate dean for ageing at Newcastle University, said it is unclear what the study might mean for human health. "Metformin is a well-established drug that acts on metabolism and has long been used against type-2 diabetes," he said. "We've known for a long time that modulating metabolism in mice can extend survival and postpone age-related conditions, and there are sound reasons why this should be the case is a small, short-lived animal. "What we don't know however is whether similar effects on lifespan might be produced in humans. "This is something that we cannot simply take for granted and the study's authors do well to sound a note of caution."	A diabetes pill has anti-ageing effects and extends the life of male mice, research suggests.
The 32-year-old former Charlton, Fulham, Chelsea and Bristol Academy player has been with Yeovil since 2015. She netted seven goals in her first term for the Lady Glovers and a further seven in 2016 as Yeovil won WSL 2. "I am so happy to be given another opportunity with Yeovil to play in WSL 1," Heatherson told the club website.	Yeovil Town Ladies forward Annie Heatherson has signed a new contract with the Women's Super League One club ahead of the 2017 WSL 1 Spring Series.
Synchronised wreath-laying ceremonies will take place in counties Cork, Meath, Wexford, Galway and Dublin, beginning at 09:45 local time in Cork. Thousands of people lined the streets of Dublin on Sunday for a parade to mark the centenary. The commemoration events have been organised by the Irish government. The rebellion is viewed as a seminal event in the founding of the state. The Easter Rising was quelled within six days by British troops, but despite its failure it is seen as a significant stepping stone to the eventual creation of the Republic of Ireland and the partition of Ireland. More than 450 people were killed and 2,500 injured during the fighting. A weekend of events to mark the centenary of the Rising began on Saturday with a remembrance ceremony in Dublin at which Irish president Michael D Higgins laid a wreath. Wreaths were also laid in Dublin at Kilmainham Gaol, where 14 of the Rising's leaders were executed, and at the Sigerson Monument in Glasnevin Cemetery, which is dedicated to to all those who lost their lives in the Rising. The synchronised wreath-laying ceremonies on Monday have been organised by the Irish Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking areas). The locations and times are: Then, at 12:30 local time, wreaths will be laid at various buildings and landmarks around the Irish capital that became focal points during the rebellion. They include Boland's Mill, Jacob's Factory, Dublin Castle/City Hall, The Four Courts, Royal College of Surgeons and Moore Street.	The centenary of the Easter Rising, the rebellion that began on Easter Monday 1916, is to be marked in Irish towns and cities with wreath-laying events.
Ball, who featured against Pakistan A in Dubai, has taken six wickets in each of Notts' first two games and is the leading wicket-taker in Division One of the County Championship so far in 2016. Read said of the 25-year-old: "Last winter he got fitter and stronger. "Now he's genuinely lively and he does plenty with the new ball." Read said Ball's assured early showings have demanded he lead Notts' bowling attack with the new ball alongside England's Stuart Broad. "Jake is in fantastic form with the ball," continued Read. "He's had a great winter having been in Dubai with the Lions and has had a taste of what life is like with the ECB set-up. He's really keen to progress that side of his career." Notts director of cricket Mick Newell said Ball, who was their second-highest County Championship wicket taker with 39 last season, said he has been "terrific" so far in 2016. "That's a fantastic start to the season and he's setting a great example," added Newell. Despite Ball's efforts against Lancashire, Notts suffered an eight-wicket defeat in their second Country Championship match of the season on Wednesday, having beaten Surrey in their opening fixture.	Pace bowler Jake Ball has made a "lively" return following a winter playing for England Lions, says Nottinghamshire captain Chris Read.
The EU is expected to renew sanctions in a matter of weeks. Alexis Tsipras was speaking at a joint news conference in Athens with the Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr Putin said there would be "no discussions" about Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula that was seized by Kremlin-backed forces in 2014, leading to sanctions from the EU and US. The territory, which has an ethnic Russian majority, later voted to join Russia in a referendum that Ukraine and Western countries deem illegal. How Russia's relationship with Europe has evolved Mr Tsipras told reporters: "We have repeatedly said that the vicious circle of militarisation, of Cold War rhetoric and of sanctions is not productive. The solution is dialogue." Mr Putin said: "As far as Crimea is concerned, we consider this question is closed forever. Russia will not conduct any discussions with anyone on this subject." Mr Putin's visit to Greece is an attempt to reinforce a relationship with one of Russia's friends in Europe at a time when diplomatic tensions continue between Russia and the EU and US, the BBC's Thomas Fessy in Athens says. Mr Putin also said that Russia would be forced to respond to US moves in Europe, warning that Washington's missile shield bases in Romania and Poland were a direct threat to his country's security. "If yesterday in those areas of Romania people simply did not know what it means to be in the cross-hairs, then today we will be forced to carry out certain measures to ensure our security." Earlier this month, the US activated the anti-missile base in southern Romania. The base in Poland is expected to be operational in 2018. The US says its shield is to protect Nato countries from short- and medium-range missiles, particularly from the Middle East.	The Greek prime minister has said sanctions imposed on Russia over its actions in Ukraine are not productive.
According to parent company Liberty Global, Virgin Media originally said it had connected 465,000 new premises in the UK and Ireland in 2016. But following a review, that number has been revised down to 314,000. Liberty said Virgin had exaggerated how fast it could complete the connections. In a regulatory filing, the US company explained that - under Virgin's own reporting standards - the figures included premises where installation work was "essentially complete" but not actually finished. That included 142,000 sites that had been expected to be connected during the first three months of 2017. However, Liberty said that in late February 2017, it had discovered that "the construction work necessary to connect a substantial number of [these premises] had not progressed as originally understood". This prompted it to carry out a review, in which it found "the completion status" of some premises had been "misrepresented". Liberty also said Virgin Media had "inadvertently" classified a further 9,000 unfinished premises as connected, when they had not been. Dan Howdle, a consumer telecoms analyst at Cable.co.uk, told the BBC: "Clearly the way in which the numbers had been reported failed to preclude the possibility of jumping the gun, though there is no evidence an intent to mislead lay behind it." He added: "Virgin Media appears to be dealing with the issue decisively, though mistakes resulting in stories of this nature are unlikely to leave a brand completely unscathed." Four Virgin Media employees have been suspended in connection with Liberty's investigation and could face disciplinary action "including dismissal". The company said the setback would affect the total number of premises Virgin Media connected during the first half of 2017. However, it said it had taken steps to speed up Project Lightning, including appointing a new managing director, Robert Evans, to lead the scheme. It also said Virgin would no longer include uncompleted connections in its figures. Launched in 2015, Virgin's Project Lightning is designed to connect about four million more UK homes and businesses to broadband speeds of 300Mbs. By the end of December it had reached 567,000 premises in total - down from the 718,000 previously reported.	Virgin Media has suspended four members of staff and begun an investigation after it admitted overstating the expansion of its superfast broadband network, dubbed Project Lightning.
Dr Helen Nicoll, 53, was found dead at home in Frog End, Great Wilbraham, Cambridgeshire, on Friday. Her husband and partner in their dental practice, Stephen Nicoll, 53, was arrested on suspicion of murder before being released on Tuesday. A post-mortem examination revealed Mrs Nicoll died from asphyxiation. Mr Nicoll was released by police with no further action and his bail cancelled. The couple had three children and worked together in their clinic in Hurst Park, Cambridge while Mr Nicoll also practises in London's Harley Street. Mr Nicoll said in a statement: "These last few days have been the worst of my life. "Nobody can understand the true loss that my children and I have experienced following the discovery that my wife Helen has taken her own life. "I would ask everybody, particularly the media, to respect our privacy and allow us to come to terms with our devastating loss and to begin the grieving process as a family following this tragedy." He added his family had "fully co-operated" with police and his wife's death had been referred to the coroner. Mr Nicoll's solicitor Paul Oliver said: "The arrest of Mr Nicoll in the immediate aftermath of the death of his beloved wife and the consequential media interest in this tragic case compounded the distress caused to him and his family. "The police have confirmed Mr Nicoll is not a suspect and he and his family now ask that their right to grieve in private be respected."	The husband of a dentist who was arrested over her death has said she "took her own life" as he told of his family's "devastating loss".
Santa Cruz's WBA Super World featherweight title will be on the line at the Barclays Centre in Brooklyn. Frampton is aiming to become the first Northern Ireland boxer to win world titles at different weights. The Belfast man has had to relinquish his IBF world super bantamweight belt ahead of his featherweight title bid. In February, Frampton beat Scott Quigg in a super-bantamweight unification bout. It saw the 29-year-old add the WBA belt to the IBF title he already held, but he has now vacated both crowns in order to challenge Santa Cruz in the higher weight division. He was stripped of the WBA crown because he did not agree to a defence against mandatory challenger Guillermo Rigondeaux. On the same night as the Frampton v Quigg clash in Manchester, Santa Cruz defended his WBA featherweight title against Spain's Kiko Martinez. Mexican Santa Cruz, 27, is a three-weight world champion and is undefeated in his 33 professional contests. "This is the fight I wanted - me and my team have been chasing it for a long, long time," said Frampton on his decision to move up a weight. "I'm 100% confident that the belt will be coming home to Belfast. It is the one my manager Barry McGuigan held 30 years ago. "Santa Cruz is a strong and aggressive undefeated champion but his style is made for me. "We know we have the tools to beat Leo. He throws a lot shots and is a proven operator. It is going to be a great fight. "I would like to say a huge thank you to the IBF for their professionalism during my time as their super bantamweight champion. "I have been a proud IBF World champion for nearly two years and I one day hope to once again become an IBF champion."	Carl Frampton's world featherweight title bout with defending champion Leo Santa Cruz will take place on 30 July in New York.
Detentions by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency jumped to 41,318 between January 22 of this year and the end of April. That was up from 30,028 arrests in about the same period last year. The dragnet follows presidential orders widening the scope of who can be targeted for immigration violations. Almost two-thirds of those arrested this year had criminal convictions, said ICE. But more than half the increase in arrests was of immigrants who had committed no crime other than being in the US without permission. President Donald Trump has stepped up immigration enforcement to target such undocumented immigrants. Acting director of ICE Thomas Homan said on a call on Wednesday with reporters that immigrants who pose a threat to national security or have criminal records are still a priority for his agency. But he added: "There is no category of aliens off the table." ICE will continue to target people who have been issued a final order of removal by an immigration judge, even if they have not committed another crime, he vowed. "Those that enter the country illegally, they do violate the law, that is a criminal act," acting director of ICE Thomas Homan said on the call. "When a federal judge makes a decision and issues an order that order needs to mean something," Mr Homan said. President Barack Obama was also criticised for deporting a large number of immigrants, but most of them were recent illegal border crossers. President Trump's signature campaign pledge to build an expanded wall on the US-Mexico border is in limbo after Congress denied funding for it in a recent budget deal. But his tough rhetoric on border security appears to be having an impact on immigration enforcement. The number of people caught crossing the border with Mexico is down significantly since the beginning of the year, according US Customs and Border Protection data. Immigration advocates have raised concerns about the stepped up enforcement in the interior of the country.	US arrests of suspected illegal immigrants rose by 38% in the first 100 days of Donald Trump's presidency, according to government data.
Drones: What are they and how do they work? Could we all soon own a drone? Viewpoint: Drones, modern war, and the US The matte black, almost featureless triangular aircraft is making its first public appearance, and the makers don't want people seeing too much of its advanced features. But this object - the rather awkwardly-named nEUROn - could be the future of combat aircraft. When a jet like the Rafale or the Sukhoi SU-35 shrieks overhead at the show, the watching crowds are left in awe at the skill and daring of the pilot. Ever since the World War I, when aces like the Red Baron Manfred von Richthofen patrolled the skies, the fighter pilot has held a special place in the imagination. But that status could now be under threat, because the next generation of combat aircraft may dispense with the pilot altogether. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, or drones, are nothing new, as their controversial use in Afghanistan and Pakistan has shown. But drones have limitations, and are vulnerable to being shot down within seconds of going anywhere near properly defended airspace. One solution is to develop much larger machines, full-scale fighter aircraft capable of flying long distances at high speed. They would be capable of bombing missions or tactical strikes, and able to defend themselves. And all without the need for a pilot. A number of experimental "superdrones" have already been built. Among them are Northrop Grumman's X-47 and the BAE Systems' Taranis. And then there's the spooky-looking nEUROn, being developed by a European consortium. France's Dassault is the lead contractor in the six-nation consortium, with the other participants being defence companies from Greece, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. The nEUROn, which made its first flight at the tail end of last year, is an ugly beast, low slung and black. Its rather bat-like appearance clearly owes a great deal to the Lockheed Martin F117 Nighthawk, better known as the original Stealth Fighter, and indeed it has been built using stealth technologies. "It's a big one!" says Eric Trappier, chief executive of French firm Dassault Aviation. "It's the size of a fighter, with a bomb bay." The aircraft has already done radar tests to assess its stealth capabilities, but a fully operational aircraft is unlikely to be ready until the end of the decade. Mr Trappier believes there is a clear role for unmanned aircraft to play in future conflicts, with fleets of pilotless planes being directed to targets by controllers on the ground, or from manned aircraft flying behind them. "In some regions you have very dangerous missions, and the use of unmanned vehicles could be very useful. For example, the destruction of enemy countermeasures or missiles or whatever. "It's mainly for the first day of war, where you don't really know what's going on in front of you, the UCAV (unmanned combat aerial vehicle) could be a good answer." So could unmanned planes one day do the job better than a fighter piloted by an individual rather than a computer? "Yes, in some types of mission it could be better. In some others, where you really need to have the pilot in the loop, well I think the manned vehicle will remain. So it's a kind of compromise between the unmanned vehicles and the manned fighters." But manufacturers wont be able to develop them without opposition.

Bruce Dickinson's airline ambitions Budget long-haul flights 'can work' A350: The plane Airbus did not want to build Full coverage: Aerospace industry The use of existing drones has faced widespread criticism, largely because of the way in which they have been employed by the CIA in particular, outside the boundaries of conventional conflict. But there have also been concerns that the operators of drones are too far removed from the battlefield to comprehend the seriousness of what they do and that mistakes can be made. But according to Mr Trappier, the issue is not whether or not drones should be used, but how they should be operated. "It's a matter of who is in charge, who is in command. You need to know what you are doing on the mission. Whether a human is in the aircraft or not, he has to be in the loop." He says much of the criticism in the US is not about the use of drones, but about who is in charge: the CIA, the Pentagon, or the armed forces. "You need to continue to operate UAVs as though you were operating a manned vehicle," he says. That's fine in theory, but would it be the case in practice? Given the amount of development money being poured into this industry, one suspects that in a few years time we will eventually find out.	Under a huge semi-opaque dome and with heavy security in attendance, visitors to the Paris Air Show peer  at a strange looking shape.
Sexist, racist and homophobic remarks were being used by pupils against school staff, as well as offensive comments about appearance, the NASUWT said. There were also examples of parents being abusive on social media, it added. About 60% of 1,500 teachers questioned in a poll said they had faced abuse, compared with 21% last year. In one case, a photograph of a teacher was posted online with an insulting word underneath. In another, pupils used the name of a heavily pregnant school worker to post insults, the teachers' union said. Of those who had been subjected to insults, nearly half (48%) said these remarks were posted by pupils, 40% said they were put up by parents, and 12% said both parents and pupils were responsible. Almost two-thirds (62%) said pupils had posted insulting comments, while just over a third (34%) said students had taken photos or videos without consent. A third (33%) received remarks about their performance as a teacher, 9% had faced allegations from pupils about inappropriate behaviour and 8% had been subjected to threatening behaviour. More than half (57%) of pupils responsible were aged between 14 and 16, and 38% were 11 to 14, the teachers' poll found, with a fifth aged 16 to 19 and 5% were seven to 11. Among the examples published by NASUWT was the case of a student uploading a teacher's photo and then, along with classmates, writing insults underneath. One teacher had been harassed for nine months by students who sent sexually explicit messages and set up a fake social media account in the teacher's name. The union said it had been told of a teacher receiving the comment "I hope she gets cancer", while the heavily pregnant worker had faced abusive remarks. Another school worker faced comments from a pupil's family member about how they looked and that they were ugly. Chris Keates, the union's general secretary, said: "It is deeply worrying to see that the abuse of teachers has risen by such a huge margin this year. "Equally concerning is that it appears that more parents are the perpetrators of the abuse. "The vile, insulting and personal comments are taking their toll on teachers' health and well-being, and undermining their confidence to do their job."	More teachers are facing abuse on social media, warns a teachers' union.
Roger Hayes, 75, from Holsworthy, Devon and son Andy, 39, from Birmingham, died when their twin-seat plane crashed at Pierre-Buffiere on 29 June, 2012. The plane crashed 20 minutes after taking off from nearby Limoges as they flew to the south of France. The coroner, Elizabeth Earland, recorded a verdict of accidental death. Andrew Cope, a senior Air Accident Investigation Board inspector, said an iPad navigation app may have prompted the pilot to make a sharp turn. Mr Cope told the inquest: "I think the pilot, Andrew, probably realised he was in restricted air space and turned around. "That's the point where things start to go awry and the flight path is quite dramatic from then on. "The pilot has now realised he is descending and is manoeuvring the aircraft to get back up. "The problem is that if that is done very quickly it puts a lot of pressure on the wings." Mr Cope agreed with the findings of French investigators who said the wings probably broke off when they came under too much pressure as Mr Hayes attempted to right the aircraft. Didier Pauliet, who works at a nearby school, said: "The aircraft started losing bits. A wing fell off violently. "Other bits, some bigger, started falling off. "The rest of the plane fell in one piece almost immediately. We could see a lot of smoke." The inquest heard the single-engine Jabiru 450 had been heading to the southern French town of Rodez when it crashed into woodland. Officials said the plane stopped off in Cherbourg on the French Channel coast, then at Le Mans, north west France, before refuelling in Limoges about 100 miles from Rodez.	An aircraft which crashed in France killing a father and son fell from the sky "like a stone" when its wings failed, an inquest has heard.
In the footage, some Kenyan soldiers can be seen carrying white shopping bags, while others appear to take white boxes from a mobile phone store. At least 67 people died when suspected al-Shabab militants stormed the Nairobi shopping centre on 21 September. The Kenyan military says it is investigating the looting allegations. News agencies say the CCTV footage is taken inside the entrance to the Westgate mall's Nakumatt supermarket, which sells everything from food to televisions. In one section of footage, several soldiers are seen walking out of the supermarket, past a blood-spattered floor, carrying plastic carrier bags. In another clip, Kenyan soldiers can be seen next to a mobile phone outlet. Heroes of attack Victims of attack One reaches over the counter, and apparently removes a white item. Then more soldiers remove white items, which the Reuters news agency describes as mobile phone boxes. The Westgate attack sparked a four-day siege in which large parts of the shopping centre were destroyed. The Kenyan military says it has launched an investigation into the looting allegations, which correspondents say will have angered many Kenyans. At the weekend, Kenya's biggest-selling newspaper, The Nation, ran an article entitled "Shame of soldiers looting Westgate". The footage of the alleged looting emerged as the Kenyan authorities announced they had recovered the body of what they consider to be a fourth attacker. "Today, Sunday 20 October 2013, we recovered a fourth body, which we know from CCTV footage to be that of a terrorist," said the Kenyan interior minister, Joseph Ole Lenku. "DNA and other investigations will confirm their identities. We have also recovered four AK47 assault rifles which we know were used by the terrorists in the assault. We also recovered 11 magazines of AK47 assault rifles." Officials had initially said 10 to 15 gunmen were involved, but CCTV footage appears to show only four militants. It is still not clear whether some of the attackers might have escaped. The Somali militant group al-Shabab said its members staged the attack in response to Kenya's army carrying out operations on Somali territory. Last week, the BBC's Newsnight programme revealed that one of the suspected attackers was believed to be a 23-year-old Somalia-born Norwegian national, Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow. His family fled to Norway in the 1990s, but he returned to Somalia in 2009 and allegedly joined the Somali militant group. Sources in al-Shabab have told the BBC Somali Service that Dhuhulow attended a training camp in El Bur in central Somalia, one of the militants' main bases. The sources said Dhuhulow took part in many al-Shabab operations in Mogadishu and Kismayo and was well-known in jihadist circles.	Security camera footage has emerged which appears to show Kenyan security forces looting goods during last month's siege of the Westgate mall.
The track broke streaming records, earning the highest first-week streams for a single in the UK with more than 2.03 million plays. Drag Me Down is One Direction's first single as a foursome since band mate Zayn Malik left and has had more than 17.7 million streams to date globally. The band shot the video for 'Drag Me Down' at NASA's headquarters in Houston yesterday. According to the Official Charts Company, Calvin Harris and Disciples' How Deep Is Your Love climbed from six to two and last week's number one, Black Magic by Little Mix, fell to three. The top five was rounded off with Lost Frequencies' Are You With Me at four, and Years & Years' Shine at five.	One Direction have topped the UK singles chart with their new single Drag Me Down.
Mae grŵp wedi'i sefydlu yn Arberth, Sir Benfro sy'n helpu i ddod â theulu o ffoaduriaid i'r DU a chynnig cartref iddyn nhw. Mae Arberth yn un o 10 tref yn y DU sydd wedi ymgymryd â chynllun gan Lywodraeth y DU yn 2016 i gymryd cyfrifoldeb o gefnogi cartrefu ffoaduriaid. Dywedodd un sy'n aelod o Croeso Arberth, Christina Hughes, wrth raglen Eye on Wales ar BBC Radio Wales nad oedd hi'n gallu "eistedd nôl a gwylio pobl yn dioddef". Felly daeth criw o bobl leol at ei gilydd i sefydlu'r grŵp, sy'n cymryd cyfrifoldeb o hyd at dri theulu drwy ddarparu cartref ar eu cyfer a'u helpu i ddysgu Saesneg er mwyn dod o hyd i waith. Mae ffigyrau yn dangos bod grwpiau cymunedol o'r fath wedi cefnogi hyd at 53 ffoadur y llynedd. Ond mae Croeso Arberth yn pryderu bod y broses yn un cymhleth. Roedd yn rhaid iddyn nhw gasglu £4,500 ar gyfer yswiriant ar gyfer y saith ffoadur maen nhw'n eu cefnogi, yn ogystal â chadw £6,000 mewn cyfrif i dalu am gyfieithwyr a chostau teithio. Mae £200 yn cael ei gadw 'nôl hefyd fel lwfans i aelodau o'r teulu. "Dyma oedd dechrau'r broses gyda nifer o ffurflenni gan y Swyddfa Gartref i'w llenwi," meddai Ms Hughes. "Doedd gennai ddim syniad faint o waith oedd yn ei gymryd. Hanner ffordd drwy'r broses roeddwn yn gofyn i fy hun 'be dwi'n ei wneud?' "Ond dwi'n falch fy mod wedi bwrw 'mlaen." Dyma beth sydd i ddisgwyl gan gymunedau sy'n noddi ffoaduriaid: Roedd rhaid i'r grŵp gael caniatâd gan Gyngor Sir Benfro cyn bwrw 'mlaen gyda'r cais i ddarparu cymorth i'r ffoaduriaid, yn ogystal â Citizens UK. Bellach mae'r broses ar ben ac mae teulu o saith ffoadur o Syria wedi cyrraedd Arberth. "Allai ddim credu bod y cyfan drosodd," meddai Ms Hughes. "Gan ein bod yn un o'r grwpiau cyntaf i gyflawni hyn dwi'n gobeithio wrth fynd ymlaen bydd y Swyddfa Gartref yn gwneud pethau'n gynt i grwpiau eraill."	Wrth i'r swyddfa gartref gyhoeddi £1m i helpu cymunedau noddi ffoaduriaid mae pryder ynglŷn â pha mor gymhleth yw'r broses.
Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al-Mekdad told the BBC "Syria is doing its best" to comply with the timetable to destroy its chemical weapons. Syria missed Wednesday's deadline to hand over its entire stockpile. Mr Mekdad said a shipment of weapons came under attack twice on its way from Damascus to the port of Latakia. "We shipped two shipments to the Syrian coast," he said. "The second shipment was intercepted by fire from terrorist groups." He added: "This is a serious business. Syria is in war, and the Americans and others have to take this into consideration." He described as "absolutely unacceptable" US Secretary of State John Kerry's recent condemnation of the government's use of barrel bombs in the city of Aleppo. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claims 246 people, including 73 children, have been killed in Aleppo in the last five days alone after barrels containing explosives and metal fragments were dropped by military helicopters. Activist group The Aleppo Media Centre claims 14 people were killed in barrel bomb attacks on the Masaken Hanano district on Thursday, citing footage appearing to show bombs being dropped from a helicopter onto a civilian area. "We are defending our people against terrorist attacks. We have never bombarded places with civilians," Mr Mekdad insisted, accusing the US of "still supporting terrorist elements" in the country. The Syrian government, via state media, also denied reports that rebels had seized most of Aleppo's central prison. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said members of the Islamic Front coalition, dominated by the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the al-Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front, mounted the assault, freeing hundreds of detainees. But state television insisted soldiers and security forces had "thwarted an attack against the prison by terrorist groups". The Observatory says fighting is still going on, but the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the Aleppo Media Centre, a citizen-journalist outlet, say rebels now completely control the prison. It is reported to hold at least 3,000 detainees, including Islamists, activists and minors, in horrific conditions. Syria has about 1,300 tonnes of declared chemical weapons. The US said last week that so far only about 4% of the stockpile - 30 tonnes - had left the country. US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said he was "concerned" that the UN-backed plan was falling behind schedule and said Damascus "had to take responsibility for fulfilling its commitment". Russia - a key ally of Syria - has said Damascus should complete the transfer of its chemical weapons to the coast for removal by ship by 1 March. A deadline was set last year for all the weapons to be destroyed by the end of June. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which is overseeing the destruction operation, has admitted the process has been slowed down by security concerns. Mr Mekdad stressed: "Syria is committed to all its agreements, with the OPCW and the UN Security Council. We shall implement on time all our obligations."	Syria says international accusations that it is delaying the destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile are "absolutely unjustified".
Conrad Clitheroe and Gary Cooper, both from Stockport, and expat Neil Munro were reportedly taking notes near Fujairah Airport, 80 miles from Dubai, when they were arrested in February. Relatives were told they were held for "national security" reasons. The men insisted they did not take photographs. The Abu Dhabi hearing is due on Monday. Mr Clitheroe, 54, and Mr Cooper 45, were visiting their friend Mr Munro, who was born in Manchester, when they were arrested on 22 February by an off-duty police officer who had seen them monitoring planes from a car. They were near Fujairah Airport, where older and rarer aircraft can be seen. A local police official said the men had been taking photographs near an airport and were using a telescope. The men are expected to argue their actions were misinterpreted and are understood to be hoping to be granted bail.	A court hearing for British plane spotters held over allegations of suspicious behaviour in the United Arab Emirates has been postponed for a week.
"What time does your website close?" in Poole and "Can I exercise my kestrel on your tip?" in Nottingham are among the top ten bizarre calls of the last year. Three of ten were made in Somerset, including: "What are the rules and regulations for hosting a mouse race?" Councils are people's "first port of call" whatever the query, says the LGA. The Local Government Association said councils' customer service hubs in England and Wales handled more than 50 million calls a year - the bulk of which are about council tax and parking. But it compiled its top ten of the "slightly amusing to the outright bizarre" queries received in the past 12 months. Peter Fleming, of the LGA, said: "These light-hearted examples of calls highlight the variety of issues that councils deal with every day."	Questions on everything from James Bond villains to Great British Bake Off cake tins have been received by council call centres in England.
The Perth club has suspended the team-mates pending a club investigation. Wright told BBC Scotland that "if what's alleged" to have occurred did in fact happen "we'll come down severely hard on both". Referee Don Robertson sent off both players during the break. Wright, whose side confirmed their top six place due to results elsewhere, says he did not see the incident as he had already started walking up the tunnel following the half time whistle. BBC Scotland reporter Jonathan Sutherland saw Foster throw a punch at Swanson, who retaliated by aiming a kick at the defender after he had slipped. "I haven't seen it with my own eyes but obviously something happened," said Wright. "I'm going to wait and see for myself. The players have been told they let themselves down, and let the team down. We should be celebrating confirming our top six place tonight. "Under no circumstance will they get off lightly if what is alleged to have happened has happened. The hardest punishment I can do legally with them, I'll do it." Media playback is not supported on this device Wright was angry that the incident left his side up against it in the second half, and that the shine was taken off the Saints confirming a top six berth. "It's another great achievement getting the top six," he added. "We showed a lot of character and should have had a penalty. (Georgios) Sarris has got arms all over Murray Davidson and that should have been a penalty kick. "The boys were magnificent and probably deserved a point but they didn't get it." Hamilton player Ali Crawford was shown a yellow card and assistant manager Guillaume Beuzelin sent to the stand after becoming involved in the chaotic scenes that followed the incident between Foster and Swanson. However, manager Martin Canning told BBC Scotland: "I would rather be talking about us. It is not something you want to see, but it is a passionate game and sometimes it spills over. "My players acted well. I think Darian MacKinnon was just trying to separate them and calm things down. "I don't think I have to take any action against my players." Hamilton moved off bottom spot in the table thanks to the win, sealed by a late Alex D'Acol goal. They are 11th on 27 points, two clear of bottom club Inverness Caledonian Thistle. "With 11 against 11 in the first half, I thought we were excellent and we kept going and got a huge three points," Canning added.	St Johnstone players Danny Swanson and Richard Foster are set to face "severe" punishments for brawling with each other in the 1-0 defeat at Hamilton, manager Tommy Wright says.
The 50p per unit minimum was approved by MSPs in 2012, but has faced legal challenges from the drinks industry. The committee on the Licensing Act 2003 also called for an overhaul of local licensing panels after hearing of "scandalous misuse" of powers. Chair Baroness McIntosh of Pickering called the act "fundamentally flawed". The Lords Select Committee said that if minimum pricing was shown to cut down on excessive drinking, it needed to be adopted nationwide. But while the government waited for legal challenges to conclude, there were other areas of the act that could be addressed, such as abolishing local authority licensing committees and giving the powers to planning committees. "The [Lords select] committee was shocked by some of the evidence it received on hearings before licensing committees," said Baroness McIntosh. "Their decisions have been described as 'something of a lottery', 'lacking formality', and 'indifferent', with some 'scandalous misuses of the powers of elected local councillors'." Derbyshire Police told peers that the system had become "too political", with councils "frightened of making a tough decision" in case of appeals by big drinks companies. But a spokesman for licensing at the Local Government Association said scrapping the panels would be "unnecessary and ill-advised". Chris Pillai added: "Figures from 2016 show that of the more than 21,000 licence applications made to council licensing committees, less than 1% were challenged. "This reflects the fairness and sound basis licensing committees are using to make their decisions." He agreed with the peers that planning and licensing could work more closely within local authorities, but said the proposed changes would "not tackle current flaws in the Licensing Act" and failed to take into account pressures on the planning system. The select committee's report also warned that the act was not working in regulating late night openings. "Pubs, clubs and live music venues are a vital part of our cultural identity," added Baroness McIntosh. "Any decline in our cities' world-famous nightlife ought to be prevented and the businesses supported. "But the night time economy needs regulating; even in these areas of cities, residents have their rights. The current systems are not being used because they do not work." The report also called for the act to be implemented at airports and for establishments to provide a disabled access statement when applying for a licence.	Minimum unit pricing for alcohol should be rolled out across the UK if Scotland's scheme is successful, a Lords committee says.
The nine-year-old's family sought redress from NHS England and South Central Ambulance Service after he became unwell in 2007 aged six weeks. He received treatment at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, but it came too late to prevent injury to his brain. The organisations denied liability, but agreed to settle the case. The High Court heard that the child, who is from Berkshire but who cannot be identified, requires around-the-clock care. He has severe cerebral palsy, profound learning disabilities, deafness, severe visual impairment and epilepsy. His legal team alleged his condition was the result of negligence by two GPs and a paramedic. They argued the boy would not have suffered the injuries if he had been given antibiotics and hospital treatment sooner. Mr Justice Kerr said the payout, which will be used to provide the boy with life-long care, "marks the end of a long and difficult process". He will receive a £2.3m lump sum and index-linked annual payments of £237,660 which will increase to £259,257 when he turns 19. Speaking after the hearing, the family's solicitor, Olivia Scates, described the case as "extremely tragic and distressing". "His family have been devastated," she said. "I am delighted the family will now have access to the help they need to provide for his extremely severe disabilities."	A boy who suffered "catastrophic brain damage" after contracting meningitis as a baby is to receive £4.6m in compensation from the NHS.
Chisako Kakehi was arrested in 2014 and went on trial in Kyoto late last month. Her lawyers have pleaded not guilty on her behalf, and when her trial began she said only that she would "leave everything" to her defence team. But in court, asked if she killed her husband, she said there was "no mistake", the Mainichi reported. The 70-year-old said she committed the crime because her husband was not treating her well financially, and that she obtained the cyanide from a business associate. "I wasn't given any money after I married him," the Japan Times quoted Ms Kakehi as telling the court on Monday. "I have no intention of hiding the guilt. I will laugh it off and die if I am sentenced to death tomorrow." Prosecutors say Ms Kakehi targeted the men for their money and poisoned them all with cyanide. The investigation began when Isao Kakehi, her fourth husband who she reportedly met via a match-making site, died on 28 December 2013, a month after they got married. A post mortem examination subsequently found traces of cyanide in his body, and investigators then began examining the deaths of other men linked to the pensioner. She is now on trial for murdering him and two other boyfriends, and the attempted murder and robbery of another boyfriend who later died of cancer. The men were all aged between 70 and 80 when the alleged crimes took place between 2007-2013. Ms Kakehi's three other husbands also all died, but she has not been charged in connection with their deaths. Lawyers for Ms Kakehi say her testimony cannot be trusted, because she has mild dementia. "Since she is suffering from dementia, she barely remembers things that happened recently let alone the incidents," her team was quoted as saying at the start of the trial, which is expected to continue until November. Japanese press have dubbed Ms Kakehi a "black widow" - a term derived from the female spider that eats its partner after mating. In April another Japanese woman, Kanae Kajima, who was convicted of killing three lovers, lost a final appeal against her death sentence at the Supreme Court.	A Japanese pensioner accused of killing three partners and attempting to murder a fourth has told a court that she fatally poisoned her husband.
But the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed. What started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts. Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media. Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason. If the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: "Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years." There was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik. In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up. That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century. Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press. So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful. This historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare. The treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll. Within days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation. And on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor. But the scandal is far from over. Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place. And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities. "For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists," Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD. "I could never have imagined that." The treason investigation has now been suspended. But chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings. It was not acceptable, he said, for politicians "to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient". Instead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions. What is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway? The fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.	Journalists have been accused of treason; a chief prosecutor fired; and we have witnessed the unedifying spectacle of government ministers scrambling to get out of the firing line after popular outrage.
Lancashire's loss to Warwickshire meant Hampshire needed to win to survive. They declared on 245-9 to leave Durham 296 from a minimum of 78 overs for victory, which they reached to end the hosts' two-year stay in the top tier. Mark Stoneman (137) and Scott Borthwick (88) excelled in their last innings for Durham before they join Surrey in 2017. England all-rounder Ben Stokes (23 not out) struck the winning runs for the visitors. Hampshire had opted to bat on during the morning session to extend their lead close to 300 and, with Lancashire struggling at Edgbaston, it soon became clear that only a win would be enough for survival. Ryan Pringle's 7-107 indicated that Hampshire's spinners would be their best hope of success, but a second-wicket stand of 162 between Stoneman and Borthwick ended their chances of achieving safety.	Hampshire were relegated from County Championship Division One after suffering a six-wicket home defeat by Durham in the season's final game.
Australian businessman David Prior said he hoped to double production at Bladnoch Distillery, near Wigtown. The single malt will be relaunched and he also has plans to introduce a new blend called Pure Scot. Mr Prior said it would be aimed at a new generation of whisky drinkers in his homeland and hoped it would have a considerable local economic impact. "I think there's some great things happening in other parts of the world with whisky - but it has got a long way to go to catch up with Scotch," he said. "So I wanted to invest in that, I wanted to be part of that. "I didn't want to try doing it back home or some other market, I wanted to do it here." He said it was "very exciting" to have Bladnoch in his "stable of businesses". "I suppose our vision is to see this as a very, very vibrant and big, functioning distillery creating a lot of employment for this region and to be the cornerstone of this community," he said. "That is what we are working towards." Get live news updates from the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway throughout the day on our South of Scotland live page service.

Shahid Tarafdar, 45, was hit by a Peugeot 307 on Stockport Road at about 15:45 GMT on 7 February. He was taken to hospital but later died. Michael Joyce, 21, from Reabrook Avenue, Manchester has been charged with perverting the course of justice. Both have been remanded to appear at Manchester Magistrates' Court later. The teenager has also been charged with a number of other driving offences including driving whilst disqualified, failing to stop and report a collision and using a motor vehicle without insurance.	A 17-year-old boy has been charged with causing death by dangerous driving, after a man died after he was hit by a car in Levenshulme.
Flint Community Hospital could be closed under plans by Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) to reorganise its services in north Wales. Campaigners joined a protest march from the hospital to attend the public meeting at the town hall. In a statement BCUHB said retaining the status quo was "not an option". The health board, which predicts a financial shortfall of Â£64.6m this year, revealed details of its proposed shake-up in July. Under plans being considered Blaenau Ffestiniog community hospital could also close and minor injury accident departments may shut at other locations. Neo-natal intensive care may also be transferred over the border to England as part of the proposed shake-up. Shortly after the plans were made public GPs in the area revealed their concerns about the effects of proposed cuts on community services. Mark Scriven, the health board's medical director, said there was sound reasoning behind the proposals to close Flint hospital. "The thinking generally about the problems we're trying to address in these proposals with community hospitals is that some of them are very old, and they have poor fabric," he told BBC Radio Wales. He said it was not just the furnishings that were not up to scratch, the physical space did not suit modern health care. "A lot of them, and the services they provide, are underused, and certainly the minor injuries unit at Flint hospital is underused, which is important because it doesn't allow the nurses running it to maintain their experience according to their professional bodies," added Mr Scriven. In response, Jack Reece, chairman of the Save Our Cottage Hospital Campaign, said Flint hospital was well used. Speaking at Tuesday protest, he added: "They've closed us, they took beds away from us. We've had 18 going down to 14, going down to 12, 10. "They're taking away our clinics from there. They have systematically dropped the services from this town." Mr Reece described BCUHB's plans as a new version of old proposals by the Flintshire Health Board which had already been rejected by the Welsh government. Explaining the reasons behind its proposed shake-up, BCUHB said it was clear that it could not afford to stand still. "The status quo is not an option," the board said. "The proposals we are now making are intended to change the way in which services are provided and where they are provided to ensure patient safety and meet quality standards. "The proposals will allow us to attract and retain the professional clinical staff we need and control our costs when public finances are decreasing." BCUHB said its consultation exercise would run until 28 October, and it would also take account of the views of the community health council and any views they have heard from the public before making decisions. Any changes would start in early 2013, it said.	More than 1,000 campaigners trying to save a north Wales community hospital from closure have marched to a health board consultation meeting.
The 35-year-old wing has signed for the Mitsubishi Dynaboars in Division Two of the Japanese League on a one-year deal. Williams scored twice in his final competitive game as Ospreys . "It was a last-minute offer that I had to give great thought to in a short space of time," Williams told Twitter. "Really looking forward to this exciting venture." Williams announced his  in February after he turned down Ospreys' offer to extend his playing career with the Welsh region to a 10th season. The 2008 International Rugby Board player of the year  in December, with 58 tries in 87 games for his country and two in four Tests for the British and Irish Lions. Williams signed off from the international stage in typical fashion, scoring a last-gasp try in the  in Cardiff on 3 December. The double-Grand Slam winner was also Ospreys' record try-scorer, with 57 touchdowns in 141 matches, and scored late on in his last game for both club and country. But Williams' final appearance in Europe was for the Barbarians in their  in Cardiff on 2 June. He was expected to continue his association with the Ospreys next season by  with the Liberty Stadium club but the Welsh region have released him for this "once in a lifetime" opportunity. An Ospreys statement said: "Taking into account his fantastic service to the Ospreys, we understand that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for Shane and his family to experience a new culture and life in a new country and will not stand in his way. "We wish them the best of luck in Japan and look forward to welcoming Shane back to Ospreylia upon completion of his playing commitments, when he will continue to represent the region with distinction off the field." Williams is second in international rugby's all-time try-scoring list behind Australian wing David Campese. And the legendary wing follows former Ospreys team-mates Jerry Collins and Filo Tiatia, who joined Yamaha Jubilo and Toyota Verblitz respectively in 2011, to Japan.	Wales' record international try-scorer Shane Williams has completed a U-turn on his rugby retirement and will play for a Japanese side next season.
PSA, which includes Peugeot, wants to buy General Motors' loss-making European arm, which includes Vauxhall plants at Luton and Ellesmere Port. There are fears that the deal could lead to job losses. Carlos Tavares, boss of PSA Group, is also set to hold talks with Unite union leader Len McCluskey. The company said it was engaged in a "constructive dialogue" with all parties. Vauxhall employs 4,500 workers at the two UK plants, with thousands more involved in its retail and components chain. A Downing Street spokesman said a request for a meeting with Mr Tavares had been received, adding: "The meeting will take place, in principle, subject to diary availability." Unite general secretary Mr McCluskey said he was pleased Mr Tavares had "responded speedily and positively" to his request for a meeting to discuss Peugeot's intentions. He said he would use the meeting to press the case for the UK's "world class facilities and workforce". Apart from meeting the prime minister, PSA will also see Germany's Angela Merkel. It could end up like a corporate beauty parade as Britain and Germany hope to persuade PSA not to shut factories in their respective countries. That's now a real possibility after General Motors said this week that it was in talks to sell its European brands of Opel and Vauxhall to PSA. European car manufacturers have far more production capacity than they need and PSA will probably want to consolidate its factories if it acquires GM Europe. Vauxhall's factories in Ellesmere Port and Luton are both very efficient, but they could face export tariffs when Britain leaves the single market, and probably the customs union, in two years - making those plants unviable. PSA said it was engaged in a "constructive dialogue" with all parties in the bid for GM's European division, which includes German-based Opel as well as Vauxhall. A spokesman said: "Our intention is to establish the same maturity in our exchanges in France, Germany and the UK. "This is why Carlos Tavares has asked to meet Theresa May as it was done with German authorities." David Bailey, professor of industrial strategy at Aston Business School in Birmingham, told the BBC that a deal would not be straightforward. "I think it's inevitable if this deal goes ahead that there will be plant closures. The plants in the UK look particularly vulnerable because of flexible labour markets and uncertainty over Brexit," he said. "So the government I think at some point will have to cut a deal with Peugeot, as it did with Nissan, over things like skills, innovation, rebuilding the supply chain. "And basically, what Nissan got, whatever it was, every other car producer in the UK will be looking for as well."	Prime Minister Theresa May has agreed to meet the head of France's PSA Group to discuss its planned takeover of Vauxhall in the UK.
His death was announced in a tweet by talent agency Conway van Gelder Grant. Born in 1925, the Rada-trained actor performed with the RSC and starred in the first production of Equus in 1973 . The National Theatre also marked his passing on Twitter, calling him "one of the most highly-regarded actors of his generation". Other notable stage roles included the Fool alongside Paul Scofield in Peter Brook's 1962 production of Shakespeare's King Lear. He also travelled the world with a one-man performance of St Mark's Gospel and played a detective in Alfred Hitchcock's Frenzy. To many, though, he will be best remembered for his brief appearance as Q - here nicknamed Algy - in 1983's Never Say Never Again. "Now you're on this, I hope we're going to have some gratuitous sex and violence!" he was seen telling Connery's James Bond in the "unofficial" remake of 1965's Thunderball. The character Q has also been most recently played by Ben Whishaw, as well as Desmond Llewelyn and John Cleese.

The Football League wants to create an extra division with 20 teams in each from 2019-20. It would mean England has 100 teams in five divisions, up from 92. There are currently 24 teams in the Championship, League One and League Two. The Football League says the move would tackle fixture congestion and boost the finances of its members. The Premier League and the Football Association have backed the proposal "in principle". Of the current 72 Football League clubs, 90% must support the proposal for it to go ahead. A decision will be made at their annual general meeting in June 2017. "There are clear benefits for everyone," Football League chief executive Shaun Harvey told BBC Sport. "It is about taking a step back to try to work out what is best for English football. "We hope that the Football League taking this first step is the catalyst for future change." However, the proposal has attracted mixed reaction from Football League clubs. Accrington owner Andrew Holt said it had "no merit", while former Leyton Orient chairman Barry Hearn believes it "has value". Other club bosses complained they had not been told about the plan before it was announced on Thursday. 'Football League shake-up would see clubs struggle financially' The Football League believes the move would help: Harvey said the Premier League and the FA have backed the idea in principle because "they can see potential benefits on an international basis". "The whole game needs to come together," he added. "It is about finding solutions that supports English football for the future." The FA said the fixture schedule needs looking at "for the benefit of all". "These are interesting draft proposals and we look forward to further discussions over the coming months," it added. Mark Lawn, the joint-chairman of Bradford City, believes the current system should not be changed. "We've had this structure for years because it has suited the majority of clubs, so why change it?" said Lawn, whose team are taking part in the League One play-offs. "What they don't understand is that currently we have 23 home games. We need the crowds. Losing four home games means we lose four incomes." Brentford chief executive Mark Devlin thinks the Football League should be praised for an "innovative and far-reaching approach". "These proposals are a really good start for how we can tackle some of the problems Football League clubs are facing," he added. For the proposal to be approved, it needs the backing of 65 Football League clubs (90%) at next year's AGM. The Football League says its board is offering "no recommendation other than asking its members to give full consideration to the proposal". The decision will have to be confirmed by November 2017. Relegation from the Football League would be scrapped in the 2018-19 season, How the promotion/relegation system would work during 2018-19 is still to be determined. Rotherham chairman Tony Stewart said he was concerned the proposal could widen existing financial gulfs between the divisions. "There is also a divide between the Championship and League One and Two and the gaps need filling in," he added. Currently, the bottom two teams in League Two are relegated from the Football League to the National League. They would not go down at the end of the 2018-19 season, said Harvey. Six other clubs - in addition to the two clubs already promoted from the National League - would join the Football League. "The logical place for the extra clubs to come from would be promoting the next six teams from the National League," said Harvey. "Some of those teams are already professional and the extension to the league may suit them." Scottish Premiership sides Celtic and Rangers have long been linked with moving into the English pyramid. In 2009, Premier League clubs voted to reject a proposal to bring the Old Firm rivals into the English top flight. Harvey has not ruled out the involvement of the Glasgow clubs, but added such a move would be difficult. But he dismissed suggestions Premier League clubs could field B teams in the lower divisions. Former Leyton Orient chairman Hearn told Sky Sports: "[Premier League B teams] would destroy the fabric of the Football League. It is poorly thought and would be a sell-out to the Premier League." The major impact would be felt by Football League clubs, who would see their number of matches reduced from 46 to 38 per season. Despite the potential of losing revenue from three fewer home matches, Harvey has asked the 72 clubs to take a "broader view of English football". "We have to make sure none of our clubs are in a financially worse position," he added. "Our clubs shouldn't be the only one to shoulder the burden. We won't be looking for clubs to take a financial haircut to support this. "We believe focusing on weekend games will, over period of time, drive bigger attendances and increase quality of performance on the pitch." Accrington owner Andrew Holt believes the new structure, if approved, would have costly financial implications for many lower league clubs. Holt said the Lancashire club would not be voting in favour of the proposal. He said: "We don't want to lose any games. We'd rather play 50 home games. because we need revenue. "If were going to play 20 times a year it's hardly worth having a stadium. I can't see any sense or any logic in the proposals. "It's just not going to get our support. I need them coming up with better ideas where we can get more games on and generate more revenue for our clubs. "These bottom clubs don't have a lot of revenue and we need to build it, not reduce it." Long midweek trips across the country for fans are "in the main" going to disappear, said Harvey. "There a hardcore of fans who are more than happy to go length and breadth of the country," he added. "But I think less games will make the Saturday at a stadium more special and more important. "It is going to be interesting to see how fans accept this. I'm hopeful it will be positive." The Football Supporters' Federation, a democratic organisation representing the rights of fans in England and Wales, said it would consult supporters at all levels. "The fans' voice has to be heard in this debate," it added.

English football could be heading for its biggest shake-up since the creation of the Premier League in 1992.
Mancini said a fully-fit Tevez could wear the sky blue shirt again, despite previously asserting that the Argentina international was "finished" at City. Tevez remains at City after interest from AC Milan, Inter Milan and Paris St Germain failed to turn into a transfer. "If he comes back - and he is fit - it is possible," conceded Mancini. I hope for him he has been training in the last three months to help his condition Tevez, 27, remains in Argentina and, as yet, there has been no indication when the striker may return. "Carlos is not an option at the moment but it is possible in the future if he comes back," added Mancini. "I hope for him he has been training in the last three months to help his condition. "There is only one thing on my mind, the Barclays Premier League." Mancini has confirmed Owen Hargreaves remains available but has struggled to gain any consistent form during his time at City, triggering the deadline-day loan deal that saw David Pizarro move from Roma. "Owen always has these little problems," said Mancini. "When he came to us in the summer we took a gamble because he had not played for two years. "We thought we could try and get him fit in two or three months and then he would be able to play. "But, like any player who hasn't played for two years, when they start to train, every day there is a problem, with his knee or his hamstring. "I hope for him he eventually is able to play all the time. He deserves to." Club captain Vincent Kompany has insisted City have the mental strength to keep their title challenge on course. City have had a mixed set of results in January, allowing Manchester United to draw level with them on points at the top of the Premier League table. If people want to underestimate us, then please do so But Kompany expects his team-mates to thrive on the pressure as they aim for a first top-flight title since 1968. He said: "If anything it will give us a boost to carry on and if people want to underestimate us, then please do so." The pressure has increased on City in recent weeks, with their 1-0 league defeat at Everton on Tuesday night coming at the end of a period which included cup defeats by Liverpool and neighbours Manchester United. The Goodison Park defeat marked Kompany's return to the City team after a four-game suspension following his red card in the 3-2 FA Cup third round loss to United in January. And he says he expects City to bounce back from the disappointment against Everton with a win against Fulham at Etihad Stadium on Saturday. "There is no shame in going under at Everton," he said. "It wasn't enjoyable, but we believe we can go back to our best football and win the games that are left to play."	Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini has named Carlos Tevez in his 25-man squad for the remainder of the season - and admitted he could pick him again.
The US has said the bombing, which took place in the Afghan city of Kunduz, was a mistake and it was attempting to strike the Taliban. MSF wants the bombing to be investigated as a war crime. Mr Obama has also apologised to the president of Afghanistan. "If it is necessary to hold individuals accountable, that will be done," said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. Mr Obama "expressed his condolences" to MSF president Joanne Liu, said Mr Earnest. "In the United States when we make mistakes, we're honest about it. We own up to it," he said. Mr Earnest also hinted at the possibility of paying victims and their families, a Department of Defense policy. He said he could not say legally whether the bombing was a war crime but the US "goes to great lengths to limit the loss of life" of civilians. In a statement, MSF said they received the apology but it was still demanding the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission (IHFFC) investigate. MSF has said it would not trust internal military inquiries into the bombing. The IHFFC was set up in 1991 under the Geneva Conventions. MSF says the co-ordinates of the hospital were well-known and its bombing could not have been a mistake. A number of inquiries have been ordered - by the US justice department, the Pentagon, Nato and an American-Afghan team.	US President Barack Obama has apologised to the president of aid agency Medecins San Frontieres (MSF) for a bombing that killed at least 22.
Aiden Webb, 22, from Norwich, was climbing Fansipan mountain alone on Friday when he fell down a ravine and lost his way, his girlfriend Bluebell Baughan said. Mr Webb, described as an experienced climber, was last heard from on Saturday when his phone went dead. The Foreign Office confirmed it was assisting his family. Mr Webb and Miss Baughan were on a four-month trip when he injured his arm and knee in the fall on the 3,100m (10,300ft) high Fansipan mountain in the north of Vietnam. More on this and other stories from Norfolk "He went to the mountain alone without a guide at 06:00 and aspired to climb it in one day," Miss Baughan said. She was in touch with Mr Webb by phone when he informed her he had fallen and could not find his way back to the trail. "He was sure he could make it back but by nightfall it was apparent he wasn't going to," she said. "Aiden said a rock had cut his arm open and he had hurt his knee. We were in touch all night. "He said no-one would be able to find him, but by 6am on Saturday he finally agreed to me getting help." Miss Baughan, who is helping co-ordinate the search from the town of Sa Pa, said rescuers had been on the mountain since Saturday morning. "Thirty-two men spent last night on the mountain, a mixture of military police, forestry workers and local police. "There is only one police officer here in Sa Pa who speaks English, but everyone has been very helpful," she said. Miss Baughan said conditions on the mountain were "very cold and wet". "Aiden is a very good climber, but he is injured," she said. Mr Webb's father and uncle are expected to arrive in Vietnam this evening although they will not reach the north until Tuesday. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokeswoman said: "We are supporting the family of Aiden Webb, a British man reported missing in Vietnam. We are working closely with the local authorities leading the search."	A British man is missing in Vietnam after falling while attempting to climb the country's highest mountain.
Brandon Lewis said he asked Avon Fire Authority to commission an independent inquiry into the claims, which the authority refutes, on at least two separate occasions last year. The government has since ordered its own investigation. The authority said its chairman will make a statement at its next meeting. A spokesman said: "The fire authority will not be making a comment today, but the chairman will be making a statement at the next meeting of Avon Fire Authority on Friday 10 February." The allegations over the fire authority, which oversees the fire and rescue service, have not been detailed, but have been described as "serious and persistent" by the Home Office. Three senior officers left the authority in five years under "unusual circumstances". The BBC also uncovered evidence of infighting. But the fire service chief, Kevin Pearson has maintained the allegations as "old and unfounded". Mr Lewis said the complaints, if well-founded "would indicate that the authority was failing in its duty to make arrangements to secure continuous improvement". Independent consultant Dr Craig Baker will lead the statutory inspection. He has advised public sector organisations for over 30 years in the UK and overseas.	A fire authority repeatedly refused to start an investigation into allegations over the way it was being run, the fire service minister has said.
Complaints have been made across the UK about the fad, which sees people dress up in order to frighten passers-by. Dyfed-Powys Police received about 30 reports over the weekend and North Wales Police said it was aware of incidents. Gwent Police had 18 reports, including clowns "peering through windows". South Wales Police put out a warning at the weekend after receiving complaints about people dressed as clowns "frightening others intentionally". Chf Insp Paul Staniforth of Gwent Police said: "Some of the reports have included, clowns running through gardens and peering through windows, lurking around shopping centres, parks and schools and jumping from trees. "Fortunately, to date, we've had no reports of anyone being harmed during these reports." He said people could be arrested for a public order offence - causing harassment, alarm or distress. The culprits are said to be following a trend that started in the US. Sgt Rhys Williams of Dyfed-Powys Police said while dressing up was not a criminal offence, "deliberately scaring someone, causing harassment, alarm or distress could lead to arrest". Officers were looking into some of the reports, but no arrests have been made. Sgt Williams added: "Please be mindful that what seems like a bit of fun to you, could not be seen the same way by those on the receiving end of this prank. "There is also the possibility that you could attempt to scare the wrong person and they could retaliate. "Anyone who commits a criminal offence should be aware that dressing as a clown does not make them exempt from being investigated and dealt with through the Criminal Justice System." North Wales Police said officers were aware of incidents, but no offences had been reported.	Sightings of "creepy clowns" have been reported across Wales, with police warning people they could be arrested for scaring others.
The warning comes as the Scottish curry industry will celebrate its annual awards ceremony in Glasgow on Monday. The rules prevent non-EU chefs being employed if a restaurant offers a take-away service. The UK government said this was designed to drive innovative cuisine. But industry sources say it has led to restaurants closing because they cannot recruit skilled chefs. The rules, laid down by the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) and the Home Office, are part of the Tier 2 visa scheme, which allows workers of sufficient skill levels to be employed on the Shortage Occupation List. They must be paid at least Â£29,570 a year, and to meet the criteria the job must also not be in a fast food or "standard fare" outlet, or an establishment which provides a take-away service. But Ajmal Mushtaq, who runs a restaurant in Hamilton providing up to 3,000 meals a week, said that was "total insanity". Holding two portions of a curry - one on a plate, the other in a take-away carton - he said: "Here is a chicken tikka chasni, one of our top selling dishes. "What the government are saying is: if I put that same dish into a container, I'm not allowed to bring expert chefs over from India. "The quality is the exact same." Mr Mushtaq said the restriction meant that plans to expand his restaurant have been put on hold. He currently employs three Indian-born chefs who have been in Scotland long enough to qualify for permanent resident status, but wants to increase his staffing. "As a result of bringing over three chefs a few years ago, I have been able to create 52 jobs in this business," he said. "We are at the point of expanding our business. If I were to bring over another two chefs, I would be able to increase the number of employees up to 95 in this one establishment alone." The industry has been putting pressure on the government to review its rules, particularly in the wake of the Brexit vote, which it sees as offering an opportunity to workers outwith the EU. International Development Secretary Priti Patel, who campaigned for a Leave vote said during the campaign, said it was a "travesty" that curry houses were subjected to a "second class UK immigration system" in comparison to EU chefs. With a growth in online apps such as Hungry House and Just Eat promoting home delivery of food, Hans Ram, chief executive of the catering recruitment agency Goldstar Chefs, said the government approach to the Indian restaurant sector was wrong. "They have totally misunderstood and misconceived the industry as being a low-paid, low-skilled jobs base. Which it is not," he said. "The biggest consequence to this is actually the skills erosion - erosion of authenticity. "It is affecting the product that the public are being served." He also pointed out that the Indian restaurant sector in the UK is worth an estimated Â£4bn a year.	Indian restaurants are closing in Scotland because strict immigration curbs mean it is difficult to recruit top chefs from the Indian sub-continent, it has been claimed.
He is appealing against an appeal court ruling lifting a ban on him being named in the media in England and Wales. The Supreme Court said it will now hear arguments about whether it should grant an appeal, and if so, decide if it should be "allowed or dismissed". An interim injunction will remain in place until the end of the hearing. On Monday, Court of Appeal judges gave the man - who has young children, and whose spouse is also in the public eye - until 10:00 BST on Tuesday to apply to take the case to the UK Supreme Court. In that ruling, they said there must be no publication leading to disclosure of the celebrity's identity before 13:00 BST on Wednesday. The Supreme Court said that interim injunction will now remain in place until the conclusion of the next hearing. The Sun on Sunday wants to publish an account of alleged extra-marital activities by the man, who is referred to as PJS. But he argues he has a right to privacy and has taken legal action. Monday's court judgement said the celebrity had "occasional sexual encounters" with another person - referred to in court as AB - starting in 2009. They had a text message exchange in December 2011 in which they discussed a "three-way" with AB's partner, CD. Accordingly, the three met for a three-way sexual encounter. In January, the two other parties approached the Sun On Sunday with the story. That month a High Court judge refused to impose an injunction barring publication. But the man appealed and two appeal court judges ruled in his favour. They prevented him being identified in publications in England and Wales. Lawyers for News Group Newspapers - publishers of the Sun On Sunday - then asked Court of Appeal judges to lift the ban. They argued that stories had been published in the US, Scotland and elsewhere where the injunction does not apply. The story had also spread across the internet and on Twitter. PJS opposed that application and said the ban should stay. On Monday, the judges ruled that PJS was now unlikely to be able to get a permanent injunction Details about the allegations were now "so widespread" that confidentiality had "probably been lost", they said. The man's solicitors had been "assiduous" in monitoring the internet and removing stories in breach of the injunction but the judges said that it was now a "hopeless task".	A celebrity who wants an injunction to keep an extra-marital relationship out of the media will put his case at the Supreme Court on Thursday.
The report warns that a failure to reintegrate returnees may lead to further radicalisation. Somalia's Islamist al-Shabab militants are believed to be recruiting heavily in neighbouring north-eastern Kenya. Kenya has seen a series of militant attacks with one at a university earlier this year killed 148 people. Although the report does not mention where the returnees came from, Deputy Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims (Supkem) Hassan Ole Nadu has confirmed to the BBC that they were fighting for al-Shabab. The 36-page report was compiled by the IOM, Supkem and the Kenya's interior ministry. Researchers found that although most adults joined the group voluntarily, nearly a third of children interviewed said they were forced to enlist. The return of the youth, the report says, provides both "opportunities and threats for and to Kenyans". "On the one hand, they present an opportunity to counter the radicalising ideologies and recruitment strategies of armed groups," the report says. "On the other, the response of the security forces is widely perceived to be promoting further radicalisation as the returnees themselves believe that they are unsafe and have limited reintegration options." Security in the country was identified by participants as the main obstacle to their successful reintegration in the country. A total of 185 respondents were interviewed, representing nearly 30% of the estimated total of 684 returnees in the country. The majority were between 18 and 34 years old.	Nearly 700 recruits have returned to Kenya after quitting militant groups, a report by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) says.
Led by "generals" Mohammed Sajjad, 38, from Cardiff, and Imtiaz Ali, 35, from Newport, the group were involved in bringing the class A drug into Wales. Cardiff Crown Court heard the group was arrested as part of one of the largest undercover operations in Wales. Four were convicted after trial, while six others pleaded guilty to their part in the conspiracy from 2013-2014. Arrests were made after police seized 40kg (88lbs) of the drug in 2014. Most was found inside a speaker and a suitcase in a car stopped on the M5, while a smaller amount was discovered in the footwell of a taxi in Newport. Officers said the seizure had prevented half a million drug deals, the court heard. Sentencing the group, Judge Stephen Hopkins QC, said the gang had dealt in "industrial quantities" of the "highly addictive evil drug". There have been more heroin seizures across the South Wales Police force area than anywhere else in Wales and England, outside London, for at least the past three years, according to figures from the Home Office. During 2014-2015, South Wales Police made 303 heroin seizures per million people. The average for Wales and England was 135 seizures per million. A force spokesman said: "There is a greater focus from the Regional Organised Crime Unit (ROCU) utilising the control strategy - which enables us to prioritise a coordinated approach on regional crime groups and the traffic of drugs."	Ten members of a gang who conspired to supply £5m worth of heroin have been jailed.
British Transport Police said the 15-year-old was attacked by a man and woman in their 40s. The incident happened at Patterton station at about 23:30 on Saturday 3 October. The teenager was punched from behind and stamped on as he lay on the ground, suffering facial injuries, including an injury to his eye. He did not require hospital treatment. His mobile phone was also stolen. The boy had been with a group of friends on the 23:05 service between Glasgow Central and Neilston. Det Con Ryan Tierney, of British Transport Police, said: "This would have been a busy service and I am aware there was an altercation between the group of younger boys and a group of older people shortly before the assault took place at Patterton. "Anyone who was on the train and has information regarding those involved who remained on until it arrived at Neilston at 23:40 is urged to get in touch as a matter of urgency."	A teenager was assaulted and robbed as he got off a train in East Renfrewshire.
The 34-year-old has been absent from the club since a training-ground row after the 5-1 Scottish Premiership loss at Celtic on 10 September. Alongside agent Eddy Jennings, he attended a meeting with club officials last week. Barton, who joined from Burnley in May, has repeatedly said he wants to return and fight for his Rangers place. "Joey Barton has been told he will return to full-time training following the conclusion of a disciplinary procedure," read a statement on Rangers' website. "The Auchenhowie [training base] management team will inform the player of appropriate training arrangements to which he must adhere for as long as he remains a Rangers player. "Neither the club, nor the player, will comment further." Barton is also facing Scottish FA charges for breaching betting rules. He was charged with placing 44 bets on games between 1 July and 15 September. The former Manchester City, Newcastle United and QPR player, who has one England cap, left Burnley under freedom of contract at the end of last season, signing a two-year contract at Ibrox. He has made eight appearances for Mark Warburton's side, who are second in the Premiership. Barton was not available for comment but said earlier on Wednesday on Twitter that it was "a lovely day for a @Iceman_Hof session and a run!" in reference to Dutch ice bath training guru Wim Hof. BBC Scotland's Richard Wilson The fact that Joey Barton is returning to full-time training does not necessarily mean the resumption of his Rangers career. Under Fifa rules, a player under contract at a club must be provided with training facilities. The fact that the player was suspended reflects the view of the management team about the serious nature of a training-ground row in September. Any return to the first-team squad would need to be handled in such a way as to not disrupt the mood and unity among the players. Rangers' statement does not say that Barton is returning to the first-team squad, or will be available for selection, and only the management team at their Auchinhowie training base is mentioned, rather than first-team manager Mark Warburton. Either the player does eventually return to the first-team squad, or his Rangers career effectively remains over and what happens in the January transfer window will be significant.	Rangers say midfielder Joey Barton "will return to full-time training" following a club-imposed suspension.
1 June 2016 Last updated at 07:33 BST He says his highlight on the International Space Station is the spacewalk he carried out and the moment he stepped into space, describing it as amazing. On his return to Earth, he says the first meal he'd like to eat is pizza. But although he's returning to Earth in less than three weeks, Tim says there's still a lot of work to do on the ISS and science experiments to complete. Peake became the first British astronaut on the International Space Station when he launched into space in December.	British astronaut Tim Peake has been talking about his return to Earth, as his mission in space nears the end.
Alongside them in the shade of a small tent adorned in the colours of the ruling party sit two men and one woman, in whose hands the future of this country are held. Front and centre is the man who has led Zimbabwe since the struggle for independence ended in 1980. President Robert Mugabe is 91 years old, has been in power for 35 years, but still oozes energy and passion addressing his supporters and his nation for more than an hour in the midday sun. He may be slower on his feet, but he's still sharp in his mind. To his left, Grace Mugabe, his second wife and the country's first lady; to his right, Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, the man who could be king. Since the beginning, Robert Mugabe has dealt ruthlessly with his political rivals and outmanoeuvred those presenting any threat to his leadership. Anyone perceived to have too much power has their wings clipped, or as happened last year, is simply blown out of the sky. Joice Mujuru was the vice-president - the one who sat next to him under the tent at the previous Heroes' Day address. She was an heir apparent who apparently became too much of a threat. Hers really was a fall from Grace as the political purge enforced by Mrs Mugabe cast the vice-president and her huge support base out of the Zanu-PF party. Now the man known as ngwenya, the crocodile, is back in the driving seat, 10 years after he suffered a similar fate. "The nickname of the crocodile is very appropriate for Mnangagwa as he has this reputation of lurking just below the surface and only striking when the moment is apposite," said Derek Matyszak, a senior researcher with the Research and Advocacy Unit in Harare. "The fact that he accepted… the vice-presidency would lead some people to think, well he thinks this is the right moment to be there." But what of Grace? Does the first lady have presidential ambitions? "Grace has been trying to increase her political capital in her own right, probably as a defence mechanism for when Mugabe does depart the scene," he said. "That, I think, has been misinterpreted to some extent to suggest that she has presidential ambition." After a period of growth during a government of national unity, Zimbabwe's economy, its currency pegged to the dollar, continues to fall as investors shy away. More than 80% of the government budget is spent on civil service salaries, and companies are laying off workers after a court ruling lifted the requirement to pay off sacked employees. President Mugabe publicly opposes the decision and used his speech to promise parliamentary action to put this right, but the party of the people knows the civil service expenditure is unsustainable and it's tempting to take advantage. In central Harare, the trading spaces are taken up with second-hand clothes and shoes. Among them are a former banker, who is just trying to make ends meet. "It keeps me going," she says. "Most industries are closing at the moment, so unemployment is a bit high, but if they open up industries, I'm sure things will improve." And a computer science student was optimistic she'd find work when she graduated. "You have to be creative enough," she said. "Like right now, selling these things - it's entrepreneurship - so for me it's cool." The government has threatened a ban on pavement thrift stores, and some traders were forced away to stalls outside town a few weeks ago. They've been labelled an eyesore, or unhygienic, but the informal economy doesn't generate tax receipts for the government, and with money short, people aren't spending in the shops. "It's rugged my friend. The economy… it's not going anywhere, it's stagnant," says a taxi tout in an American football shirt. "I'm a qualified accountant, but there's no jobs, you can't find employment anywhere, so I don't know what to do." In his speech to the nation, President Mugabe admitted: "We are still grappling with the task of transforming our economies," but he tried to reassure people things were on the up. There were certainly plenty of tourists at Victoria Falls and the Hwange National Park last week, and Zimbabwe still sits on precious metals and diamonds, but foreign investment is the key and confidence is low. The economic ideas of Emmerson Mnangagwa and his close ally, Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa, are already impressing Western institutions and those too nervous to invest while the old man prevails. His ambitions for open democracy may not be as advanced, but the right-hand man may be someone the international community can do business with. But President Mugabe, leaning on his lectern as he delivers his speech, is a difficult man to read. After all these years, it's hard to see him settling on a successor and handing over power, unless he's thinking about his family and the political exposure they could face if he died in office. The opposition takes the purge of Joice Mujuru and the internal split in Zanu-PF as a sign of some hope, but it may have had the opposite effect and made a cleaner succession much easier. They are arguably even more divided and unprepared to challenge for power, after losing unfair elections and then failing to gain from a unity government. The cult of personality wins votes in Zimbabwe, which explains why Morgan Tsvangirai still leads the Movement for Democratic Change and holds hopes of one day being president. After 15 years of trying, he's still passionate in his words at least. "We are not waiting for him to die," he said. "We have always done what we believe every struggle should do - you mobilise the people, you re-energise the base. "You continue giving people the hope that a democratic alternative is a possibility." But the strength of those on the podium, alongside the huge golden statue of liberation heroes, still hold the future of this country in their hands.	The huge golden statue of three liberation soldiers - two men and a woman - form the centrepiece of Heroes' Acre, the monument to Zimbabwe's fallen.
Denny Solomona crossed for Castleford, but Wigan led at half-time against the run of play through Lewis Tierney's try and Matty Smith's penalty kick. Grant Millington's try put the visitors back in front, before John Bateman went over to restore Wigan's two-point lead. Nick Gregson got his first senior try and Bateman crossed again late on as Warriors climbed to third in the table. Having suffered their heaviest defeat in Super League since 2005 with a 62-0 loss to Wakefield in their previous fixture, Wigan started slowly but were good value for their win after the break. The hosts failed to take advantage when Luke Gale was sent to the sin-bin for dissent with the scores level in the first half, but Bateman's return to the side after two games out sparked the comeback. Shaun Wane's team also welcomed back Dom Crosby, who made his first Super League appearance of the season having recovered from a hip injury. Solomona moved clear as Super League's leading try-scorer with his 13th of the season, but Tigers were frustrated by improved Wigan defence in the second period as they suffered their fourth defeat in a row at the DW Stadium. Wigan coach Shaun Wane: "I don't want to keep going on about it. But, if you knew what we had gone through this week, there's so much toughness showed in that game against a really good Cas team. "The admiration I have got for my players, the desire to grind out the win with the circumstances that nobody knows about is unbelievable. "There were quite a few good performances, they are a good team and are well coached who know how to defend. "We're not the biggest team, but I thought the way we defended was outstanding." Castleford coach Daryl Powell: "That last try gave the score a bit of an easier look than it was. It was tight all the way through. "We lacked a little bit of quality in our play. I thought we defended awesome, they came at us in the second half with a game plan that put us under pressure. "They made minimal errors and kicked well and we couldn't find a spark to get us out of yardage and into good field position. "They deserved to win the game, they had more ball than us in decent field position and we had to work really hard to keep them out and that drained our energy reserves." Wigan: Sarginson; Tierney, Bateman, Gildart, Charnley; Gregson, Smith; Mossop, Powell, Clubb, Tomkins, Isa, Sutton. Replacements: Crosby, Tautai, Burke, Bretherton. Castleford: Hampshire; Monaghan, Minikin, Webster, Solomona; Holmes, Gale; Lynch, Milner, Jewitt, Holmes, McMeeken, Massey. Replacements: McShane, Millington, Maher, Cook. Referee: Phil Bentham.	Wigan moved level on points with Super League leaders Warrington by coming from behind to beat Castleford.
Media playback is not supported on this device Three people who know Armstrong well gave their thoughts. The wife of former professional road cyclist Frankie Andreu, she claimed, long before his public confession, that Armstrong took banned substances and bullied team-mates. "When the going gets tough, he turns on the charm. He thinks if he can show he's a changed man it might benefit him. The problem with that is that he has no credibility. His actions speak louder than his words." Andreu believes there should be no way back into cycling for Armstrong. "He should forget it. He's not going back into sport. He should go and enjoy something else, enjoy his family. Everyone deserves a second chance, but how many does he want? What is he? A cat." The Sunday Times journalist first raised questions about Armstrong in 1999. He wrote LA Confidential, a book containing evidence that Armstrong used performance-enhancing drugs. "When I see an interview like he's just done with Dan Roan, I just feel this guy hasn't changed one iota. When he's saying everyone was doing it (doping), he's being so unfair to the people who rode the 1999 Tour de France and tours over the following years clean - and plenty did." Walsh believes Armstrong is struggling with being out of the limelight. "This is a guy who would get called up by he president of the United States and asked to go on a mountain bike ride, this is a guy who had direct access to people like Bill Clinton and John Kerry... Bono was a big mate of his. Now, no-one really wants to be associated with him - and that's tough if you were once in the place that Lance Armstrong was in." A former French road cyclist, his career effectively ended when he spoke out against doping in the 1990s. "The fact that he says that he doesn't regret it and that if he went back to the same time, he'd do it again... I think that shows an honesty." Bassons, who clashed with Armstrong after making his doping claims, also thinks the American has changed - or been changed. "When I saw him last year, it wasn't the Armstrong that I knew in the '90s any more. Back then, he was strong, he was hard, he would stare you in the eyes, he was brutal, he was strong and he would never make a mistake. But when I saw him last year, he was alone, he was badly dressed, he avoided eye contact, he didn't seem happy."	In an interview with BBC Sports editor Dan Roan, shamed cyclist Lance Armstrong said he should be forgiven for doping and lying - but also admitted he would probably cheat again.
Helmut Oberlander says he was forced to act as a translator for the squad and did not participate in atrocities. He has fought three prior attempts by Canada to strip his citizenship and won. His lawyer says Mr Oberlander will also fight this latest citizenship revocation, calling it "persecution". A spokeswoman with Citizenship Canada said in a statement to the BBC that "we don't take citizenship revocation lightly, but it is necessary in cases of fraud and serious misrepresentation". Canada says that when Mr Oberlander  applied for entry to Canada in 1954, he obtained his citizenship by knowingly concealing that he had been an auxiliary of the Einsatzkommando, a force that operated behind the German army's front line in the Eastern occupied territories. The squad is responsible for killing more than two million people, many of them Jewish people. "We are determined to deny safe haven in Canada to war criminals and persons believed to have committed or been complicit in war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide," said Citizenship Canada's Lisa Filipps. Mr Oberlander has argued in court that he was conscripted, had no alternative than to work for the Germans, and would have been subject to the harshest penalties had he disobeyed. Canada has revoked his citizenship three times since 1995.  Each time it was overturned on appeal. In 2016, Canada's Supreme Court refused to hear the government's appeal of a lower court ruling that Ottawa should reconsider its decision to revoke Mr Oberlander's citizenship. His lawyer Ronald Poulton says Canada "appears prepared to hound Mr Oberlander and his family to his grave". "In order to find Mr. Oberlander complicit in war crimes, given his limited and forced participation with the German military, they had attempted to stretch fiction into fact and to rely on an outdated archaic principle known as guilt by association," he said. Mr. Oberlander was born in Halbstadt, Ukraine in 1924, and he obtained his Canadian citizenship in 1960. Shimon Koffler Fogel, with the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, praised Canada for its "tireless" efforts to strip Mr Oberlander of his citizenship. "This latest development is an important milestone in bringing a measure of justice to his many victims and their families," he said in a statement. Mr Oberlander's case is expected to be back before a federal court within the next six months.	Canada has revoked the citizenship for the fourth time of a 93-year-old man who has admitted to being a former Nazi death squad member.
Citizens Advice Scotland (CAS) called for urgent government action as it revealed a 47% increase in food bank inquiries on its services. It said it provided advice on emergency food providers 7,400 times in 2014/15. The UK government said the report failed to recognise that poverty in Scotland was at a record low. A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said it spends Â£90bn a year on working-age benefits to help the most vulnerable in society. The food bank statistics emerged in a new report - Living at the Sharp End - in which CAS researchers investigated the root cause of the trend. The report revealed clients often arrived at citizens' advice bureaux hungry, having not eaten for days, and with no money for essentials. A total of 71% told researchers they cut down on food when they were faced with a gap in their income. The report also found the service was increasingly seeing people who had exhausted all forms of government support and whose only option was to go to a food bank. The Scottish government is set to gain control of some aspects of welfare in September. Scottish Secretary David Mundell is expected to sign off the transfer and timetable later this week. The report's findings included a profile of the CAS clients who sought advice about food banks. It found that: CAS head of policy and public affairs Susan McPhee, called for urgent government action to prevent people slipping through the safety net of social security. "When reports like this have been published in the past, the standard reaction of the UK government has been to say that there is a support network in place that prevents people falling into destitution," she said. "Our evidence today shows beyond dispute that this is simply not the case. "If it were, there would be no need for food banks at all, yet Scottish CABs had to give food bank advice over 7,000 times last year, and our report shows that too many Scottish families are struggling in severe poverty." The report found changes to the benefits system, low pay, insecure work and the rising cost of living contributed to their clients' money problems. It also discovered that benefits problems - including administrative errors and sanctions - forced people to seek crisis support. The report makes a series of recommendations designed to increase people's resilience to "income shocks", prevent gaps in income and improve crisis assistance. Ms McPhee said: "As our new prime minister takes office, this report makes clear that the social security system is simply not working for the most vulnerable people in our society. "We make a number of recommendations in our report about how to improve this, and we want to work with both governments to make those changes happen. "But it is clear that action is needed now." The DWP said the report failed to take into account the latest statistics on poverty in Scotland. A spokeswoman said: "Work is the best route out of poverty and since 2010 there are 140,000 more people in work in Scotland. "We're also continuing to spend around Â£90bn a year on working-age benefits, supporting the most vulnerable in society."	The most vulnerable people in Scotland are falling into destitution because the benefits system is "simply not working", according to a charity.
The 32-year-old knows Coleman's side will be tough to beat having improved hugely since two defeats by Serbia in the last World Cup qualifying campaign. The Chelsea defender, who has led Serbia to the top of Group D, says they face a difficult match ahead of them. "This is the hardest game since we started qualification," he said. Ivanovic scored in the 6-1 thrashing of Wales in 2014 World Cup qualifying at Novi Sad, in September 2012 - the heaviest defeat in Coleman's reign. A year later he was part of the side which won 3-0 at the Cardiff City Stadium - the last time Wales lost a home qualifier. Set to earn his 91st cap for his country on Saturday, Ivanovic believes the scars of the past will provide extra motivation for Wales. "We know that and we have to be careful with that. We have to play much much better than last time to get something from the game because Wales is a completely different team from that moment," he continued. "Those kind of games happen may be once in 100 years. It's very difficult to win against one team three times in a row even when the opponent is not that strong and you cannot say that about Wales." Serbia go into the game topping the group as they edge the Republic of Ireland on goal difference while Wales are two points adrift in third. The visitors will be without the suspended Manchester City defender Aleksander Kolarov, who is suspended after collecting two bookings in the group. Wales will welcome the return of Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey for the first time in this campaign after his recovery from a hamstring injury. Ivanovic believes they will be stronger for his inclusion, but inevitably the major threat will be Real Madrid star Gareth Bale. "I think he is the biggest name and biggest star in the Wales team. But I think Wales as a group have improved," Ivanovic said. "The team have played a couple of years together to bring results and will, of course, be very difficult to stop Gareth Bale and the rest of the guys." "Most important for us is we have a lot of new things - new coach, new shape of the team. We are still building. We have improved a lot from last summer and we are going in the right direction. "But the way to Russia is so long we have to be careful and we have to play every single game like a final.  We know this is our hardest game so far."	Branislav Ivanovic says Wales will want to avenge their previous two defeats against Serbia when they meet in Saturday's World Cup qualifier.
Radioactive cooling water was also mistakenly discharged into a submarine reactor compartment, the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) reported. Reporting of safety incidents at the base, which refits Britain's nuclear submarines, was "below standard". Contractor Babcock International said safety was its "highest priority". The ONR issued a legal notice to improve after an incident last year in which a worker was contaminated with radiation. The ONR said the dose was "very small" but it "highlighted shortfalls" in health and safety at the yard. Babcock has been ordered "to bring the arrangements up to an acceptable standard" before the end of January 2016. The ONR said five other incidents broke safety rules between October and December last year. They were: The ONR also reported "shortfalls in the operation of the emergency monitoring vehicles" during a nuclear submarine accident exercise. Peter Burt, researcher at the anti-nuclear weapons pressure group Nuclear Information Service, said: "This is a worrying string of events in a short time at Devonport. "If the site operators are not able to improve performance rapidly the MoD should take steps to take the operating contract away from Babcock." Nuclear engineering consultant John Large, who has advised the government and environmental groups on nuclear issues, said: "These are not uncommon incidents in a complex operation like Devonport. "But the level of detail is not good enough. For instance what is the connection with the torpedo tubes and a radiological incident on the submarine?" The ONR declined to go into any more detail on the incidents, saying the reports were intended as summaries. Babcock said in a statement: "Improvements relating to the ONR enforcement notice and other recently reported incidents at Devonport Royal Dockyard are being addressed through a broader nuclear safety improvement programme to further enhance our current high levels of safety, in agreement with ONR." Plymouth City Council said it "takes the safety of nuclear operations at Devonport extremely seriously, as does the site operator. "It is protocol that we are informed immediately of any safety issues or incidents that are likely to be of concern to the wider public. "The operator also reports on its safety performance every six months at the local liaison committee." The Ministry of Defence (MoD) declined to comment.	Devonport naval base has been warned of legal action after a worker received a dose of radiation amid a series of safety breaches.
Mohammed Haji Sadiq denies committing 15 child sex offences over a 10-year period. Mr Sadiq, from the Cyncoed area of the city, taught Koran Studies at the Madina mosque between 1976 and 2006. Cardiff Crown Court heard he "took advantage of his position". He is accused of eight offences of sexual assault of a child under 13 by touching and seven offences of indecent assault. The allegations involve four girls and are said to have taken place between 1996 and 2006 at the mosque, then situated on Woodville Road in the city. The court heard the girls were aged between five and 11 at the time of the alleged offences. The jury heard Mr Sadiq would touch the girls in intimate places. Prosecuting barrister Susan Thomas said one of the alleged victims was told to lay face down on the defendant's lap, while he touched her bottom. When interviewed by police the defendant said the allegations were made for political reasons within the mosque and that other allegations were for "financial motivation". Mr Sadiq has had no involvement with the mosque since 2006. The trial is due to last up to 10 days.	An 81-year-old man who taught at a Cardiff mosque created a culture where physical punishment "was the norm", a court has heard.
Kat Merchant and Emily Scarratt scored early tries for England before Rawina Everitt crossed for New Zealand. Further tries from Merchant and Roz Crowley put England 24-10 up before Selica Winiata crossed on half-time. Jo Watmore added a fifth try and Scarratt's boot did the rest, Kendra Cocksedge's late try mere consolation. 23 Nov: England 16-13 New Zealand 27 Nov:  England 17-8 New Zealand 1 Dec: England 32-23 New Zealand England head coach Gary Street said: "Obviously we're hugely delighted to have won here at Twickenham and to wrap up the series in front of a big home crowd. The players, as a group, were once again outstanding and they showed tremendous mental strength to get through this series and win it 3-0. "There is a lot of trust in this group and that shows every time a squad member pulls on the England shirt. We may not have won a World Cup for many years but we are definitely the number one side in the world at the moment." England produced some superb flowing rugby at Twickenham, with the backs profiting from the good work of the forwards to run New Zealand ragged on occasions. The Black Ferns had the edge in the maul but they could not cope with England's pacy all-round game. New Zealand showed attacking intent from the off but after early pressure England broke out from their own 22 as Natasha Hunt took a quick tap penalty. Watmore made good ground, producing a couple of trademark hand-offs, and Merchant supported well to scorch over in the corner. Three minutes later Scarratt latched onto Katy McLean's neat chip and full-back Scarratt converted her own try to make it 12-0. 2010: New Zealand 13-10 England 2006: New Zealand 25-17 England 2002: New Zealand 19-9 England New Zealand hit back as Everitt crossed for a converted try but the hosts were soon back on the front foot, with Merchant beating three tacklers and taking another one over the line with her for an unconverted try. Kelly Brazier landed a penalty for New Zealand as the scoreboard continued to kick over but England had the upper hand and they added a fourth try, converted by Scarratt, as prop Crowley finished off another fine attack. New Zealand are not world champions for nothing though and, with England down to 14 after Heather Fisher was sin-binned, Winiata scored in the corner to make it 24-15 at half-time. The visitors cut the gap to six points soon after the restart as Brazier squeezed over a penalty, but that was as close as they would get. The Black Ferns lost Aroha Savage to the sin-bin and Watmore made them pay with a fine try after an arcing outside break, and Scarratt soon added a penalty to give England a 32-18 lead. Cocksedge cut the gap for the world champions but England ended the game on top and looked the more likely scorers at the final whistle.

Turner, who spent nine years as a player with Posh before winning back-to-back promotions as manager in the early 1990s, was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia in 2006. His wife Lynne previously said doctors told her the illness was "caused by heading too many balls". Turner also played for Cambridge United, Luton, Swindon and Southend. He started his playing career at Peterborough in 1969 and made more than 300 appearances. His playing career also included time in the US. Turner retired as a player in 1984 and took over as boss at Cambridge United a year later, managing them until 1990. His successful reign at Peterborough ended in 1992, when he stood down to become chairman. Mick Halsall, who captained Peterborough to victory in the play-off final in 1992, said Turner was a "great, great leader". "He had a great ability to nurture," Halsall said. "[We were] a bunch of scallywags who achieved so much, and in my opinion wouldn't have achieved it under anyone else." Bob Symns, Peterborough chief executive, said Turner was "a legend who'll never be forgotten". John Beck, who was brought to Cambridge as a player by Turner in 1986 and went on to take the club to the brink of the Premier League as manager, said Turner was a "very lovable man". "I'd gone to meet the manager at Peterborough and I was going to sign, but then I got a phone call from Chris," he said. "I went down to the Abbey (Stadium) and knew instantly that this was the man I wanted to sign for. "He was just a wonderful person. Great warmth, great fun, great personality."	Former Peterborough United and Cambridge United manager Chris Turner has died, aged 64.

Christie - 'Every place in America is a target' 17:40 ET By the time the afternoon session of the Republican Jewish Coalition presidential forum was wrapping up, most of the participating candidates were all but certain as to the exact nature of the violence in San Bernardino. "I assure you it is an act of terror," said former Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore, later warning that this was just the beginning. "We have to be prepared because the world is breaking down." Carly Fiorina took aim at the likely Democratic nominee. "Hillary Clinton was tweeting about gun control while we learned that radical Islamic terrorists have been building pipe bombs," she said. And New Jersey Governor Chris Christie spent nearly his entire 30-minute speech talking about the implications of Wednesday's attacks. "For the first time since 9/11," he said, "we're going to have to confront the loss of American life on American soil to terrorist conduct." And he added some words of warning. "If a centre for the developmentally disabled in San Bernardino, California, can be a target for a terrorist attack, then every place in America is a target for a terrorist attack." The New Jersey governor is pinning what were once fading presidential hopes on national security. After the Paris attacks and the events on Wednesday, he feels the US public is giving him another look - and a recent poll of New Hampshire voters shows that he has gained some momentum, moving ahead of Ben Carson into fourth place. "The entire campaign changed a few weeks ago," he said. "We need to come to grips with the concept in America that we are in the midst of the next world war." He went on to attack fellow candidates Rand Paul by name and Ted Cruz by implication - both for voting in the Senate to support a rollback of National Security Agency surveillance operations that went into effect last weekend. "Every candidate who comes on this stage should be honest with you and tell you we need to do these things," he said. "And anyone who doesn't is putting American families at risk." 13:30 ET According to Donald Trump, the violence in San Bernardino on Wednesday "probably was related" to "radical Islamic terrorism". During remarks at the Republican Jewish Coalition, the New York real-estate mogul wondered why President Barack Obama won't use those words. "There is something going on with him that we don't know about," he said. Several years ago, Mr Trump - before he was a presidential front-runner - made the rounds on the political talk show circuit as one of the leading voices of the "birther" movement - that bit of the conservative fringe that questioned the validity of Mr Obama's birth certificate and his American bona fides. Old habits, it seems, die hard. Rubio - 'We live in a different world' 12:00ET "We certainly have learned some facts that are concerning and weigh on our minds,"  Marco Rubio said early in his speech before the Republican Jewish Coalition presidential forum. The Florida senator no doubt was referencing the possible Islamic ties of the assailants in the San Bernardino shooting - albeit in a much more oblique way than his fellow senator, Ted Cruz, did earlier Thursday morning. "We live in a very different world than the one I grew up in, the world that you grew up in and the world we had not long ago," Mr Rubio continued. While Mr Rubio's words were carefully, intentionally vague, Mr Cruz wasn't the only candidate to directly tie Wednesday's attacks to overseas terrorism. Inadequate gun-control laws are not to blame for the California shootings, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters after his speech. "It's about two people who have bought into an ideology that's just absolutely insane." Former New York Governor George Pataki said we don't know for sure whether the shootings in San Bernardino "involved terror or not", but it was a "horrible, horrible planned assault". What we do know, he continued, was that the bombings at the Boston Marathon, the shooting at the US Army base at Fort Hood and the foiled assault at an art exhibit in Garland, Texas - all of which have happened during Barack Obama's presidency - were "carried out by radical jihadists here in America". The US should not let First Amendment protections of free speech stand in the way of confronting this "warped view of jihad", Pataki continued, comparing a ban on inflammatory Islamic rhetoric to prohibitions on yelling "fire in a crowded theatre". "Radicalisation in America isn't protected speech," he said. "It is a crime, and we should stop it." 10:43 ET Texas Senator Ted Cruz took the stage at the presidential forum hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition and called for a moment of silence for the victims of the San Bernardino shootings. Then, while acknowledging "the details of what happened are still unclear", he said that he is "deeply concerned" that the events in California are "another manifestation of radical Islamic terrorism here at home". He said the San Bernardino shootings, along with the Paris attacks last month, "underscores that we are in a time of war". "Whether or not the current administration realises or wishes to acknowledge it," Mr Cruz continued. "Our enemies are at war with us. I believe this nation needs a wartime president to defend it." The Texas senator then pitched the audience of Republican Jewish activists and deep-pocketed conservative donors on why he's the man for the job. As he did in last month's Republican presidential debate, he chided President Barack Obama for not using the term "radical Islamic terrorism". A president, he said, must speak the truth. "When the president stands up and says the Islamic State isn't Islamic - that's just nutty," he said, calling Mr Obama an apologist for "radical Islamic terrorism". He said as president he would make sure the US does more to stand by its allies - Israel in particular - and defeat its enemies. "If you are voting for Hillary Clinton," he said, "you are voting for the Ayatollah Khamenei to have a nuclear device."	Republican presidential candidates speaking at a forum in Washington, DC, have responded to the mass shooting in California which left at least 14 dead.
The services will take place at 11:00 GMT on 7 January. The Church in Wales announced the move ahead of the consecration of the first woman bishop, Canon Joanna Penberthy, as Bishop of St Davids on 21 January. In January 1997, 62 women were ordained, with their names set to feature on a new logo. The services will take place at cathedrals in Llandaff in Cardiff, Newport, Bangor in Gwynedd, St Asaph in Denbighshire, Brecon in Powys and St Davids in Pembrokeshire. Canon Enid Morgan was among the first ordained, along with Canon Penberthy, and she will give an address at Bangor Cathedral. She described "frustration" after spending 12 years as a deacon, with a sense of "much energy wasted". But then "things seemed to happen very quickly" after a bill was passed in September 1996 allowing women priests, she said. Canon Morgan added: "A whole generation has grown up seeing women priests and their ministry as normal and we can start taking some things for granted."	The 20th anniversary of the ordination of Wales' first women priests will be celebrated with simultaneous services at every cathedral in the country.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had identified 33 local areas where pubs would not face sufficient competition after the deal. Heineken, which already owns 1,100 pubs, must submit plans to the CMA by 20 June or face an in-depth inquiry. However, the brewing giant said it would address the CMA's concerns. "This decision by the CMA acknowledges that there are only a small number of local areas where competition may be diminished due to our acquisition of the pubs," said David Forde, managing director for Heineken UK. "We are confident we can offer the CMA suitable undertakings to satisfy their concerns." The preliminary CMA investigation concluded that the deal would not damage the chances of Heineken's competitors selling their own products, as the pubs being bought only make up 4% of the market. It also felt that it was unlikely Heineken would reduce the choice of beer and cider available in the Punch pubs, as this could lead it to lose business.	Heineken has been told to address fears that its purchase of around 1,900 pubs from Punch Taverns could affect competition in some areas.
The charred pine twigs date back 140 million years to a time when fires raged across large tracts of land. Pine trees now dominate the forests of the Northern Hemisphere. The research suggests the tree's evolution was shaped in the fiery landscape of the Cretaceous, where oxygen levels were much higher than today, fuelling intense and frequent wildfires. "Pines are well adapted to fire today," said Dr Howard Falcon-Lang of Royal Holloway, University of London, who discovered the fossils in Nova Scotia, Canada. "The fossils show that wildfires raged through the earliest pine forests and probably shaped the evolution of this important tree." The specimens, which are described in Geology journal, were preserved as charcoal within rocks from a quarry. "It was only when I digested [the samples] in acid that these beautiful fossils fell out," Dr Falcon-Lang told BBC News. "They were sitting in my cupboard for five years before I actually worked out what was there." The fossils are just a few mm long but probably came from trees resembling the Scots Pine that now cover large areas of Scotland. Pines are well adapted to fire, containing inflammable deadwood that makes them burn easily. They also produce cones that will only germinate after being scorched, ensuring a new generation of trees is seeded after the fire has passed by and other vegetation has been destroyed. Scientists have debated for many years why some trees seem to thrive on wildfires. "One of the oddities about pine trees today is that they are one of the most fire adapted species on our planet," explained Dr Falcon-Lang. "These oldest pine fossils are preserved as charcoal, the product of fire, suggesting that the co-occurrence of fire and pines is something that's very ancient, that goes back to the very origin of these first pine trees." Dr Falcon-Lang plans to return to the quarry this summer to recover more specimens. He hopes to find fossils of flowering plants, which were evolving at the same time as the ancient pines.

6 March 2017 Last updated at 14:51 GMT The window was smashed before accelerant was poured inside and it was set alight at 03:30 GMT on Sunday at the Park Regis Hotel in Broad Street, Birmingham. Mayweather was appearing in the city, meeting fans as part of a tour. An eyewitness who filmed the damaged vehicle but did not wish to be named said: "He [Mayweather] was actually outside when the van was set on fire, then he ran back in. More on this story and others around Birmingham and the Black Country. "There was panic inside the whole hotel. Nobody was allowed out of the hotel for a couple of hours. They had the whole hotel on lockdown." There is no sound on the video.	A van used by retired world champion boxer Floyd Mayweather has been set on fire, police said.

The three-week trial on the 23.4m long 'up' escalator at Holborn station is taking place during peak hours. Transport for London said the move will "increase the capacity" and prevent "queuing at the bottom" as people stand on both sides of the escalator. More than 56 million passengers use the station every year. Usually passengers stand to the right, leaving the left side free for people to walk up or down the escalators. Holborn Tube station, one of the busiest on the network, is set to get a new entrance and an enlarged ticket hall in order to increase its capacity by 80% by 2022. Peter McNaught, operations director for the Central line, said: "In the meantime, as part of a three-week trial to reduce queues and keep people moving through the station, we are encouraging customers to stand on both sides of the 'up' escalators during busy periods. "We believe this will increase the capacity of the escalators as more people will be able to board, preventing queuing at the bottom of the escalator."	Commuters are being asked to stand rather than walk on the left side of escalators at a central London Tube station to see if it can cut queues.
He was the only person nominated after the previous leader, Jamie Adams, pulled out of the contest. Mr Simpson left the council's cabinet and Independent Plus Political Group (IPPG) in 2014 over disagreements about the way the group was being run. The IPPG has led the council since 1996 but lost 20 councillors in the 4 May elections. Mr Simpson won the backing of the Labour, Liberal Democrat, Conservative and Plaid Cymru members in his leadership bid.	Unaffiliated councillor David Simpson has been elected as the new leader of Pembrokeshire council.
Coffins representing two men and two women who resisted the Nazis in World War Two were carried through the French capital before being interred. The coffins contained only soil from the fighters' graves as their relatives did not want their bodies disturbed. French President Francois Hollande said the group "embodied the spirit of the Resistance". A ceremony was held at the Pantheon alongside the coffins of Germaine Tillion, Genevieve de Gaulle-Anthonioz, Pierre Brossolette and Jean Zay. Tillion, who died in 2008, and de Gaulle-Anthonioz, a niece of former French leader Charles de Gaulle who died in 2002, were caught and deported to the Ravensbruck concentration camp in Germany. Brossolette, a radio journalist who broadcast on the BBC during the war, committed suicide after being arrested and tortured in 1944. Zay, who was minister of education before the war, was killed in 1944, having tried to set up a government-in-exile in north Africa. "Faced with the occupation, with submission, they gave the same response," Mr Hollande said. "They said 'no', immediately, firmly, clearly." Mr Hollande drew parallels with those who marched in French cities on January 11 this year, days after terror attacks on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper and a kosher supermarket. The induction now sees three women interred at the Pantheon, after the scientist Marie Curie. There are now 74 men interred at the mausoleum, the first being the writer Victor Hugo.	France has honoured four members of the French Resistance with a ceremony at the Pantheon mausoleum in Paris.
Fire, police and coastguard teams were called to Butley Creek near Orford, Suffolk, on Wednesday by a member of the public who had seen the supine figure of a man lying in the water. The "body" turned out to be a work of art called A Thousand Tides, which has been at the site for more than a year. A Suffolk Police spokesman described the work as "quite realistic". Read more Suffolk stories here The sculpture, by artist Laurence Edwards, was designed to only be seen at low tide and was intended to sink eventually. However, Mr Edwards said it had "stayed on the surface longer than it should". He said: "I've always been a bit worried that a helicopter would spot it and want to rescue it. "To convince someone it's a real person is a great achievement, although I would like to apologise to the poor person who called it in." The sculpture was a parting gift to the area from Mr Edwards, who had a studio and foundry works nearby for 15 years until spring 2016 before moving to Halesworth. Mr Edwards' website says his work "attempts to do justice to the locality and its history, by peopling it with large figures that have survived the ravages of the water and the elements." Suffolk Police confirmed they attended Butley Creek, saying: "Police received a call from a member of the public reporting what they believed to be a body in the river. "The fire service and coastguard were also called to assist, but a short while later this was actually confirmed to be a sculpture." A Thousand Tides is reminiscent of Antony Gormley's Another Place installation on Crosby beach in Merseyside, which depicts 100 bronze figures looking out over the Irish Sea.	Three different 999 services had to be stood down after a "body in the water" turned out to be a bronze sculpture.
It is part of a wider disposal of problem debt on both sides of the Irish border. Most of the loans - 86% - that are being sold off are in the Republic of Ireland. The rest relate to business in Northern Ireland. While the face value is about £15m, the actual value is now likely to be considerably less. The process starts next week and should be completed by the end of the year. It is understood the loans being disposed of have been under special management for a significant time. The sale is not connected to the squeeze on agricultural incomes linked to the current downturn.	Ulster Bank is to sell off agricultural loans in Northern Ireland with a face value of about £15m.
The Spanish-language TV network had cancelled its contract to broadcast the Miss USA pageant which is co-owned by Mr Trump. Univision had said last week it would not air the pageant because of what it called insulting remarks about Mexican immigrants. Mr Trump is running for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Mr Trump has accused Univision of stifling his freedom of speech in order to boost the Democratic Party frontrunner, Hilary Clinton. While announcing his candidacy earlier this month, he had accused Mexico of sending rapists and other criminals to the United States. He also pledged to build a "great wall" on the US border with Mexico and insisted it would be paid for by Mexicans. He later insisted he was criticising US lawmakers, not Mexican people. US TV network NBC has also said it would not be airing the Miss USA and the Miss Universe pageants both owned by Mr Trump. Responding to the announcement, Mr Trump said he would consider suing NBC.	The US presidential candidate Donald Trump has filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit against Univision.

Mr Cameron missed the weekly prime minister's questions to fly to be with his father in hospital. Downing Street said his father died shortly after the PM arrived at the hospital in the South of France. He told ITV in March his father was a "huge hero figure for me" who had a great sense of optimism. It is understood the prime minister will remain in France overnight. Mr Cameron was told on Wednesday morning his father was seriously ill after suffering a stroke and heart complications. After talking to doctors at the hospital, the PM decided to fly to be with his father and mother Mary. Downing Street said French President Nicolas Sarkozy had arranged a helicopter to take Mr Cameron to the hospital so he could see his father. Sources told the Press Association he was "incredibly grateful" as he may not otherwise have been able to get there in time and was "relieved" to have been at his bedside. By Ross HawkinsPolitical correspondent, BBC News To David Cameron his father was a hero, a man who never complained about his disability and a key inspiration behind the 'Big Society' theme that characterised the Conservative election campaign. In a newspaper interview he reflected: "I've never really heard him whinge about anything." After the election Ian Cameron said he always thought David had the capability to be prime minister, but added unlike his son, he was not a politician. He spent his professional life as a stockbroker, and sat on parish and church councils. David Cameron said his father and mother - who worked as a magistrate -  "wore their public service so lightly". David Cameron said he almost gave up politics after his six-year-old son Ivan died last year. Last week the Camerons brought their new-born daughter Florence home to Downing Street. Ian Cameron did not see his grand-daughter before he died. Nick Robinson: Painful times Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who stood in for Mr Cameron at the first PMQs after the summer recess, sent his thoughts and condolences to Mr Cameron's family and said he was glad the PM was "able to be at his father's side at the end". Chancellor George Osborne told the BBC: "It's a very difficult day for David Cameron and his family. "I know David was very, very close to his father, and his father hasn't been well over recent years, but he's always been a really strong presence I know in David's life, and I'm sure he'll be missed by David and missed by all of us who knew him." BBC political correspondent Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Cameron had often spoken of the close bond between him and his parents, who lived in Peasemore, Berkshire. Ian Cameron, 77, was born with both legs deformed, and endured repeated operations in an attempt to straighten them and ease his pain. Despite his disability he forged a successful career as a stockbroker and is a former director of estate agent John D Wood. The prime minister said before the general election that his father was a "glass half-full" person with a "sense of optimism". He told ITV 1's Trevor McDonald: "My father is a huge hero figure for me, because he's an amazingly brave man.... "To have a disability in the 1930s and 1940s, a different age, was really tough, but  he never let it affect him in any way. " Giles Andreae, a friend of Mr Cameron's, told the BBC: "David adored his father and his mother. I think they both have a really seminal influence in the man he is now and in his politics actually." Mr Cameron's wife Samantha gave birth to their fourth child, Florence, last month. The couple's first child Ivan, who was born profoundly disabled and needed round the clock care, died in February 2009. Mr Cameron's biographer James Hanning told the BBC family was "hugely important" to the prime minister: "They are a very strong family but they have been through it." Labour leadership contender David Miliband said he was "very sorry" to hear the news: "My thoughts are with David and his family." A spokesman for Gordon Brown said the former prime minister had written to Mr Cameron to express his condolences.	Prime Minister David Cameron's father Ian has died after suffering a stroke and heart complications while on holiday in France.
"[President Barack] Obama must now start focusing on OUR COUNTRY, jobs, healthcare and all of our many problems," he tweeted. "Forget Syria and make America great again!" Two years ago Mr Trump built a winning presidential campaign around this very theme, sharply criticising Democrats and some fellow Republicans for what he viewed as their overly interventionist foreign policies. Just a week ago Secretary of State Rex Tillerson appeared to be following this new script when he downplayed calls for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's removal, saying his status "will be decided by the Syrian people". Then on Thursday night, two days after another chemical weapons attack, President Donald Trump ordered a guided missile strike on a Syrian government airfield. The move marks a dramatic turnaround from Mr Trump's prior rhetoric and the expectations of how he would conduct his foreign policy. In his remarks following the missile strike, the president explained that it was in the "vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons". He even called on "civilised nations" to end the "bloodshed and slaughter" of the Syrian civil war and insisted that "peace and harmony" will prevail. The man who was thought to be a neo-isolationist now, just months into his presidency, is projecting US military force abroad to enforce international norms and punish human rights abuses. What changed? It seems clear that the graphic images of dead and dying Syrian civilians - including "beautiful babies", in Mr Trump's words - had a dramatic effect on the president's disposition. With a few notable exceptions, the strike is being praised by Washington politicians on the left and on the right. In the coming days, however, some serious questions will be posed. If the president's foreign policy outlook can shift so dramatically in just a few days, if not hours, will allies and adversaries interpret this as a sign of flexibility or incoherence? A cruise missile strike is a low-risk form of military action, but it also is of limited effectiveness. A White House official described this as a warning shot across Mr Assad's bow. If the Syrian president continues to use chemical weapons or conduct conventional attacks that result in significant civilian casualties, will the US escalate its military intervention or back down and risk appearing weak? When Mr Obama contemplated using force against the Syrian government, he decided that he would need congressional authorisation to do so. Will Mr Trump now seek approval from the lawmakers, on both sides of the aisle, who were reluctant to give the Democratic president such approval? Thursday night was Mr Trump's first significant foreign policy challenge, and it appears to have dramatically changed his outlook, his rhetoric and his resulting actions. The candidate who constantly spoke of putting America first ended his brief remarks on Thursday night by calling for God's blessings not just for his nation but for the "entire world". This strike - and this change of attitude - may simply be a one-off event. Or, perhaps, an unlikely globalist has been born.	Four years ago, after the Syrian government launched a brutal chemical attack on its own civilians, Donald Trump warned anyone who would listen that the US should refrain from launching retaliatory military strikes.
The 26-year-old victim had been standing at a bus stop in Wallacewell Quadrant in Glasgow at about 23:45 on Friday when a car pulled up beside him. A young man who was a passenger in the car got out and chased him with a hammer into a nearby park. The car was then driven at him and hit him before two other men jumped out and attacked him with weapons. The attackers then got back into the vehicle - a small silver car - before driving back onto Wallacewell Road. One of the men is described as being in his early 20s with blond hair. He was wearing a red top. The other two men are described as being in their late teens to early 20s. Their victim is being treated at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow. Det Con William Corkindale of Shettleston CID said: "This was a horrendous attack which has left the victim seriously injured and it is imperative that we trace the people responsible. "I would appeal to anyone who was in the area around the time the incident took place, who may have witnessed what happened or saw anything suspicious, to come forward. "We understand that the front passenger window of the small silver car involved was smashed and so I would also ask anyone who noticed a car matching this description to get in touch."	A man has been left in a "serious but stable" condition in an attack being treated by police as attempted murder.
The Â£230m development consists of 11 wind turbines. Mr Trump claims they would spoil the sea views for golfers on his course at Menie. He responded: "We will put our future plans in Aberdeen on hold, as will many others, until this ridiculous proposal is defeated." Mr Trump said: "We will be bringing a lawsuit within the allocated period of time to stop what will definitely be the destruction of Aberdeen and Scotland itself. "This was a purely political decision. "We will spend whatever monies are necessary to see to it that these huge and unsightly industrial wind turbines are never constructed." He had previously threatened not to build a hotel at the resort if it went ahead. Ministers said they were committed to a "successful and sustainable" offshore wind sector. The European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre (EOWDC) project is a joint venture by utility company Vattenfall, engineering firm Technip and Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group (Areg). The project is aimed at providing enough energy for more than 49,000 homes. The Scottish government said the centre would allow offshore wind developers and supply chain companies to test "cutting edge" wind technology before its commercial deployment. Energy Minister Fergus Ewing said: "Offshore renewables represent a huge opportunity for Scotland; an opportunity to build up new industries and to deliver on our ambitious renewable energy and carbon reduction targets. "The proposed European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre will give the industry the ability to test and demonstrate new technologies in order to accelerate its growth. "It secures Aberdeen's place as the energy capital of Europe." He added: "The EOWDC is the first offshore wind farm to pass through the new approvals process for offshore wind development and as such is a test case for the industry. The diligence and expertise of officials in Marine Scotland, among the statutory consultees and other interests should give confidence to the offshore wind industry and its supply chain that planning matters should not be a barrier to investment in Scotland." EOWDC project spokesman Iain Todd said: "The Scottish government's most welcome approval for the EOWDC is extremely positive news for both Scotland and the UK's offshore wind industry as it helps position Scotland, the UK and Europe at the global vanguard of the sector. "The project partners will assess the consent and associated conditions as part of the planning and programming for the next phase of the scheme." Alex Salmond, the MSP for Aberdeenshire East, said: "I welcome this decision. "The north east of Scotland is a world energy capital and in order to continue to prosper we have to be at the forefront of all forms of energy research - marine renewables, as well as oil and gas." Dr Sam Gardner, senior climate change policy officer at WWF Scotland, said: "Giving the go-ahead to this offshore wind test centre is the right decision, demonstrating that no amount of bluster from US billionaires such as Donald Trump will hold Scotland back from becoming a cleaner, greener, job-creating nation." Robert Collier, chief executive of Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: "The north east is already established as a global hub for the oil and gas industry. "The development of the EOWDC will enable the region to extend its reach with regard to offshore wind, further enhancing our renewable energy expertise and drawing upon our strong engineering and technology skills base. "This is an important development for the region."	Consent for a wind farm off Aberdeen which is opposed by Donald Trump has been granted by the Scottish government, angering the US tycoon.
The Tower Blocks - Our Blocks project has been described as a "Domesday Book" of the UK's post-war reconstruction. It will include images of towers which have been demolished over the past 30 years, as well as those which are still standing. It has been created by social and architectural historians from Edinburgh College of Art. The project is to receive a Â£52,900 grant of Heritage Lottery funding. This money will go towards digitising the 3,500 photographs, as well as supporting local outreach initiatives which the team hope will encourage high-rise residents to tell their stories. Glasgow's Red Road flats and Gorbals housing schemes will be among the multi-storey housing projects on show in the publically accessible digital catalogue. Other well know high rises to feature in the archive include the Everton flats in Liverpool, Birmingham's Chelmsley Wood, Manchester's Hulme redevelopment, and London estates such as Broadwater Farm, Thamesmead and Roehampton. The project is due to be completed by late 2017. Prof Miles Glendinning, head of the Scottish Centre for Conservation Studies at the college of art, said: "We hope this project will help contribute to the ongoing shift in public attitudes towards the post-war Modernist housing heritage, which is fast turning from an object of dislike and alienation into a force for potential community empowerment. "Council tower blocks were once the most prominent and dramatic legacy of the post-1945 reconstruction drive, but mass demolitions over the past 35 years, still continuing today, have depleted this vast heritage, leaving it obscured or incomprehensible to the public at a time when popular interest in post-war Modernist heritage is sharply increasing." Colin McLean, head of the Heritage Lottery Fund in Scotland, said: "Without archives, vast segments of our nation's history would be missing. "As the high rise towers that have dominated many towns' and city's skylines begin to disappear, it is important for us to capture this heritage and give voice to the experiences of those who live in these flats and communities." Glasgow 2014 chiefs faced criticism when they planned to demolish the Red Road flats as part of last summer's Commonwealth Games opening ceremony. They eventually ditched the proposal to blow down five of the six remaining 1960s blocks live on television amid fears of a public protest. Critics said it was insensitive to former residents and to the asylum seekers who still occupied the sixth block. When they were built between 1964 and 1969, the Red Road flats were the highest in Europe at 292ft (89 metres).	Images of every tower block built in the UK are to be catalogued in a fully searchable digital archive.
The birds, which are native to southern Europe, set up nests by burrowing tunnels in the banks of Low Gelt Quarry, near Brampton. An RSPB viewpoint on the perimeter of the quarry has attracted more than 1,000 people in two weeks. The RSPB said all chicks had hatched and would fledge in the next few weeks. The pairs were discovered by a foreman, who noticed the colourful birds flying among the site's colony of nesting sand martins. They are expected to leave the nest in about four weeks. Two pairs successfully raised chicks on the Isle of Wight last year and previously in County Durham in 2002. An RSPB spokesman said they were "delighted" the birds had bred in the UK for a second consecutive summer. Bee-eaters can burrow up to 10ft (3m) and usually lay clutches of four to nine eggs.	Visitors have flocked to Cumbria to see two pairs of rare bee-eater birds which set up their home at a quarry.
Justice Secretary Michael Matheson has directed Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland to investigate the actions of undercover officers. A review is ongoing in England and Wales, but the UK government has refused to extend it to Scotland, leaving Mr Matheson "disappointed". Victims of police spying had called for a Scottish inquiry to be set up. Holyrood's parties had been united in calling for an extension to the Pitchford Inquiry, which was set up in England and Wales to investigate allegations of misconduct by undercover officers. There are allegations that undercover Metropolitan Police officers had fathered children and caused miscarriages of justice, with claims of this activity extending to Scotland. Mark Kennedy, one of five officers known to have had relationships with women while undercover, is alleged to have infiltrated environmental groups ahead of the G8 summit at Gleneagles in 2005. Labour MSP Neil Findlay wrote directly to the policing minister, Brandon Lewis, but was told that it was "not possible" to extend the probe north of the border for "a number of reasons". Mr Matheson said he was "firmly of the view" that extending Pitchford would be the "right thing to do", and said he was "disappointed" with the UK government's refusal. He said: "Given the operational extend of the units involved, the Scottish government believes that a single coherent inquiry is the most effective approach to provide a comprehensive investigation into these activities. "However, in light of the Home Office's decision I have today directed Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland to undertake a strategic review of undercover policing in Scotland." The justice secretary said this investigation would cover "the extent and scale of undercover policing in Scotland" dating back to 2000, as well as operations carried out by the Met Police units under investigation by Pitchford. He added: "This review will also give independent assurance on the operation, procedures and safeguards in place by Police Scotland in relation to undercover policing." The Scottish Liberal Democrats welcomed the news, with Liam McArthur describing the probe as "nothing less than required". But Mr Findlay said it was "minor progress", calling it "the police reviewing the police" rather than the public inquiry he had called for. Victims who are participating in the Pitchford Inquiry had hit out at the decision not to extend it to Scotland, calling on Holyrood to order its own probe. A group of 17 victims issued a joint statement after Mr Lewis refused to extend the inquiry saying they were "extremely frustrated", saying it "sets the inquiry up to fail before it even begins". One of the group, Merrick Cork, added: "It's outrageous that Theresa May thinks victims of police abuse deserve justice in England but not in Scotland. "The police admit English officers committed human rights abuses against citizens on Scottish soil. It's absurd to expect public trust in police when abuses of power are swept under the carpet, and it's a snub to Scotland to say it doesn't matter there." Mr Lewis defended the limited scope of the inquiry, saying it was "extensive and complex" already, and needed to "proceed swiftly" without further delays. He added: "The Home Office is confident the inquiry can both gain an understanding of historical failings and make recommendations to ensure unacceptable practices are not repeated without a need to consider every instance of undercover policing, wherever it was taken."	The Scottish government has ordered an independent review of undercover policing in Scotland.
Richard McAuley, 42, from Townhill Road in Portglenone pleaded guilty to the murder of Denise Dunlop, aged 32. The fatal stabbing occurred in the living room of Ms Dunlop's Centuripe Avenue home in Ballymena last June. The court heard that as a result of the attack, the couple's daughter suffered a "complex and traumatic experience". McAuley was told by the judge, Mr Justice Weir, that he had caused "enormous and permanent harm" to his daughter. The court heard that prior to the attack, on the evening of 14  June,  Ms Dunlop and McAuley had gone to her father's house. As they made their way back home in a taxi accompanied by Ms Dunlop's step-mother, the taxi stopped at an off-licence where alcohol was bought. When the taxi arrived back at Centuripe Avenue, Ms Dunlop's seven-year old daughter returned home from the babysitter's and they watched football on the TV. A row between the couple then broke out - possibly over an ice cream that was given to the girl - which resulted in what Mr Justice Weir described as "mutual pushing and pulling". As Ms Dunlop sat on the sofa, McAuley went to the kitchen where he armed himself with a knife. He returned to the living room, where he stabbed his partner three times in the upper body in front of their daughter and Ms Dunlop's step-mother. A wound to her chest, which passed through her left lung and heart, proved to be the fatal injury. Mr Justice Weir said the killing was "senseless" and told McAuley his actions had deprived a young girl of her mother. Saying the row was "fuelled by drink and drugs", the judge said a young woman had died in a row which was "almost unbelievable in its triviality". Since murdering Ms Dunlop, the court heard McAuley had made the case that he acted as he did due to provocation. However, the judge said that while he accepted the couple's 13-year relationship was on and off - largely due to McAuley's substance abuse - there was no history of violence between the couple, and there was "no justification" for McAuley's actions. Mr Justice Weir told McAuley: "You are a powerfully built man of six feet one, while the deceased was a foot shorter. There was no excuse for bringing a knife into this silly domestic dispute. "The deceased was very drunk, and the prescription drugs she had taken would have made her intoxication worse. She was no threat to you." The judge also told McAuley he did not believe his claims that he did not intent to kill Ms Dunlop, and that the knife attack was carried out in front of their daughter and Mrs Dunlop "without a thought for the consequences for them." The court heard McAuley has 44 previous convictions.	A County Antrim man who stabbed his partner to death in front of their seven-year-old daughter has been given a minimum 12-year sentence.
Gwent Police was called to the incident near Raglan Services at about 11:30 BST on Sunday. The ambulance service said a patient had been taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary. The road was closed in both directions between Monmouth and Raglan for about four hours but police said traffic was now moving freely.	A person has been taken to hospital by air ambulance following a serious crash on a major road in Monmouthshire.
The 58-year-old school principal from Dublin won 144 out of a possible 278 votes and was 98 ahead of his nearest rivals Sean Walsh and Frank Burke. Horan will take over from current president Aogan O Fearghail in 2018. "Aogan is the president for the next 12 months so I'll support him and learn from him as best I can," said Horan at Croke Park. The other candidates for the post were Martin Skelly with 22 votes while 20 went to Robert Frost. This weekend's annual congress will be dominated by new championship proposals in football and hurling. The plans put forward by GAA director general Paraic Duffy include completing the All-Ireland Senior Championships by the end of August. Also included is a new round-robin format for the All-Ireland SFC quarter-finals, which would mean more games. This proposal has proved particularly controversial in recent weeks. Both the Gaelic Players' Association and recently formed Club Players' Association have come out against Duffy's plans, although not necessarily for the same reasons. Ostensibly, the main reason for these mooted changes is to try and ensure more regular games for club players but there is a certain  amount of bafflement as to how this can be squared with the motion to have a round-robin stage in the All-Ireland Football quarter-finals. The new club players' body has been angered after the GAA's top brass refused to grant it a speaking platform at the Croke Park gathering. However, that may change at further annual gatherings of GAA delegates if a motion for the club players' body to be officially recognised is passed in Dublin. All the indications are that the votes on both the so-called new 'Super Eight football round' and the proposal to bring forward the All-Ireland finals will be exceptionally close, with a two-thirds' majority required for the format changes to be tried for a three-year period. To make matters even complicated, congress will also hear a number of motions calls from the two-thirds majority to be scrapped, with one call suggestion a simple majority and another calling for the figure to be lowered to 60%. Inevitably, those motions will require a two-thirds majority to be passed. Going into the weekend, Croke Park's desire for replays to be scrapped - in favour of extra-time - in all championship games bar provincial and All-Ireland finals looks likely to be comfortably passed. At last year's congress, motions to move All-Ireland Finals to earlier in the year and scrap replays were both defeated, although the finals proposal fell narrowly short after getting support from 60.8% of delegates.	John Horan easily won the vote at Congress on Friday night to become the GAA president-elect.
The government is currently negotiating with the Lib Dems and Greens to strike a deal to get its budget plans passed. Green co-convener Patrick Harvie has asked for concessions over tax, while Lib Dem Willie Rennie has targeted up to £400m of additional spending. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay has said he is "positive" about winning support. With the SNP a minority government, they will need at least one opposition party to help the budget pass, either by voting for it or by abstaining. Mr Mackay has indicated a budget deal with the Conservatives or Labour is unlikely, but said there was "room for manoeuvre" in talks with the Lib Dems and Greens. And while he has said no matters are "absolutely closed", he wants to "adhere as close to the [SNP] manifesto as possible" on tax, making a deal with the Lib Dems the more likely. The Lib Dems said they wanted "substantial changes" made, which would "set Scotland on a stronger, more liberal path". These focus on the party's manifesto pledges around education and mental health. Specific measures include: Mr Rennie said: "Liberal Democrats will not agree to the draft budget as it stands and will need these substantial changes. If we don't get what the country needs then we will walk away. "Our plan invests for a step change in mental health and a transformation in education that will help in the road to a liberal Scotland. A properly funded pupil premium and more money for colleges will create that opportunity and boost jobs and the economy. "New investment in mental health services will boost this Cinderella service and make the whole NHS more sustainable in the future. We have also included support for alcohol and drug services, a higher budget for the police and lower cost transport for the Northern Isles. "I have had a number of meetings and discussions with the finance secretary so far and I am looking forward to receiving his response to our plan." Mr Mackay has defended his tax and spending plans in two meetings of the finance committee, where he also took questions from the public over social media. The committee will submit its report on the budget on Friday 27 January, with the first chamber debate on the budget the following week. The final vote on the budget will follow a separate vote on Mr Mackay's tax proposals, in the week beginning 20 February. This is a decent snapshot of what the final budget deal is likely to look like. Willie Rennie probably won't get absolutely everything he is asking for - one would suspect Derek Mackay is too good a negotiator for that - but this is a far more palatable list of demands for the finance secretary than that put forward by the Greens, who want to see some movement over tax. While he says nothing is off the table, Mr Mackay isn't going to budge on tax. He sees his current proposals as well-balanced, and endorsed by the electorate last May. And with a deal with Labour or the Tories more or less dismissed in advance on political grounds, that leaves Mr Rennie as the clear favourite. He may well have beefed up his demands accordingly - minus any red lines, of course, over tax. There are plenty of talks still to come, but there is also plenty common ground here. Expect a SNP/Lib Dem coalition to usher an amended budget through come the end of February.	The Liberal Democrats have set out funding for education, mental health and transport links as their demands for backing the Scottish budget.
Adrian Brown, 38, experienced a "severe psychotic episode" when he stabbed Muhammed Ali on a London Overground train on 12 December 2016. Judge Deborah Taylor QC ordered that Brown should be detained indefinitely. She added he would only be released on the order of a judge or the government. Brown, of Brockley Rise, south-east London, appeared via video link from Broadmoor Hospital during the hearing. A jury found Brown not guilty following a two-day trial at Southwark Crown Court. He was also found not guilty, by reason of insanity, of possession of an offensive weapon and of assault by beating of Mr Ali. The trial heard Brown had been delusional in his belief he would "save humanity" and exorcise a Muslim demon haunting him by stabbing his victim. The court was told he was heard by other passengers to say "Where are all the Muslims? I am going to kill all the Muslims", before holding a knife to the throat of another woman, who was unhurt. Brown accepted carrying out the attack but pleaded not guilty to a charge of attempted murder on the grounds of insanity. Mr Ali had been travelling home with his wife when the assault took place between Honor Oak Park and Forest Hill, south London. He told court that the attack had left him too frightened to leave his house. "I struggle to sleep at the time because every time I shut my eyes I have flashbacks to the whole thing", he said. "I can only assume it was me because my wife was wearing a headscarf." Detaining Brown indefinitely under section 37 of the Mental Health Act, Judge Taylor said: "You have a long history of psychotic illness and on that day you were suffering and you continue to suffer from paranoid schizophrenia. "There's no doubt that if it had not been for the prompt intervention of an off-duty police officer and two medical practitioners that he he may well have died such were the severity of his injuries and the loss of blood."	A man with schizophrenia who repeatedly stabbed a train passenger after yelling "I want to kill all the Muslims" has been found not guilty of attempted murder by reason of insanity.
The Bournemouth striker, who has been included in a 27-man final squad, has yet to receive official clearance from Fifa to play for the country of his parents. The 23-year-old has represented England at youth level since 2005, having captained the Under-12s, won the Victory Shield with the U16s, and turned out for the U17s, U19s and U21s. Afobe is expected to join up with his prospective teammates next week in Kinshasa, but Fifa is yet to approve his application to switch nationality under world football's governing body regulations. According to the rules, players who have represented one country at junior level can play for another at senior level if they meet the qualifying stipulations. He holds dual nationality and has not played for England's senior side, making him eligible for the Leopards - once an application has been made to Fifa and approved. Afobe, who moved to Bournemouth from Wolves for £10m in January, has scored four goals in 10 appearances for the Cherries so far this season. The former Arsenal striker scored 23 goals in two seasons with Wolves. Meanwhile, the DR Congo squad will officially commence their preparations at Béatrice de la Gombe hotel in the capital on 20 March. They are currently third in Group B after a home win over Madagascar and a shock 2-0 defeat at Central African Republic in September. CHAN winner Florent Ibenge, who also guided DR Congo to third place at last year's Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea, is desperate for positive results against group leaders Angola. Only group winners are guaranteed automatic qualification to the 2017 tournament in Gabon. The Leopards have also progressed to the final round of qualifying for the 2018 World Cup.	Ex-England youth international Benik Afobe will not play for DR Congo in next weekend's 2017 Africa Cup of Nations clash with Angola.
In a strongly worded letter to all teachers, Gavin Boyd also said they got better pay than their counterparts in England and Wales. Teaching unions are refusing to co-operate with school inspections in a dispute over pay and workload. Some are also taking occasional strike action. The National Association of Schoolmasters and Women Teachers (NASUWT) has reacted angrily to Mr Boyd's letter, accusing him of "fake news". Mr Boyd is chief executive of the Education Authority and represents the teaching employers in negotiations over the current pay dispute. He wrote that the industrial action was "seriously affecting the education of children and young people" and "the effective operation of schools". He also said teachers had been "confused by misinformation" on a number of issues. "The average teacher's pay in Northern Ireland is just over Â£40,000 per annum," he added. "This compares very favourably with other graduate professions locally and is actually higher than the average teacher's pay in England and Wales." He said that teaching unions had rejected an overall offer of 2.5% on pay in 2015-16. "There have been no reductions in teacher's pay," he said. Mr Boyd conceded that national insurance and pension contributions had risen, but said these were "part of a wider government strategy to ensure public sector pensions remain affordable and sustainable". "Public sector pensions remain attractive and in general offer much better terms than those available in the private sector." However, the NASUWT's general secretary Chris Keates said his letter would infuriate teachers. "Teachers will not be persuaded or intimidated by the fake news presented in the letter," she said. "The value of teachers' pay has fallen by around 20% since 2010. "The employers should start to devote more of their time to addressing the genuine concerns of teachers rather than peddling misinformation." The letter will not help to resolve disputes between teachers and their employers, said Heather Watson, the principal of Phoenix Integrated Primary School in Cookstown, County Tyrone. She was "shocked, confused and disappointed" when she received the letter. "It hasn't done anything to reassure teachers that they are respected and valued," said Ms Watson. "I understand that there are two sides to this, but I really want the two sides to get their act together and address the issues." Jim Clarke, the chief executive of the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, which represents teachers' employers, said the information in the letter was "factually accurate". "It might not necessarily agree with everyone's perspective but all we can do is present the facts as they are," he added. In a related development, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation (INTO) has accused the Department of Education of "attempts at bullying" by writing to a Catholic archbishop about the ongoing industrial action. In a letter to members, INTO said that the Department of Education's permanent secretary Derek Baker had written to Archbishop Eamon Martin. They said Mr Baker had requested that Archbishop Martin ensures that school governors co-operate with school inspections. "Attempts at bullying, such as this, should be rejected as an unsubtle attempt to bring the action to an end," they wrote. However, in a statement to the BBC, the department responded by describing the claim as "utter nonsense". "The letter focuses exclusively on the statutory duty placed on governors in respect of safeguarding and promoting the welfare of pupils and seeks their cooperation with the ETI specifically in respect of child protection and safeguarding," they said. "The suggestion that the department's letter amounts to bullying is utter nonsense".	Northern Ireland's top education official has accused teachers of harming children's education by taking industrial action.
The move would reverse a long-held policy of not naming alleged war criminals in the Syrian conflict. Investigators said on Friday there had been an "exponential rise" in atrocities committed in Syria. UN figures show that more than 220,000 people have been killed during Syria's four-year civil conflict. The investigators - from the UN's Commission for Inquiry on Syria - said they had prepared five lists of names including "a variety of perpetrators from different groups". The Commission refused to say how many suspects were named, but diplomatic sources told the BBC there were approximately 200. The Syrian government has carried out innumerable air strikes on rebel-held territory throughout the conflict, and has been accused by human rights organisations of killing thousands of innocent civilians in the process. The UN's High Commissioner for Refugees says more than nine million Syrians have been displaced as a result of continuing fighting. Speaking after a briefing of the UN Security Council on Friday, a spokesperson for the Commission said that they were "weighing the pros and cons" of publishing the lists of suspects. The BBC understands that if they decide to publish the lists it will coincide with the UN Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva on 17 March. In a report published on Friday, the Commission stressed that both the Syrian regime and the main Islamist militant groups active in Syria - Islamic State (IS) and al-Nusra Front - had committed atrocities, as well as other smaller factions. The report warned that despite the Commission's "long-standing position" not to name suspects, maintaining that policy would "reinforce the impunity" of alleged war criminals. Speaking on Friday, investigators said that they had increasingly been sharing information with countries to enable them to prosecute their own citizens for crimes committed in Syria. They revealed that four of the lists of names of alleged war criminals had been passed to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and a fifth would be handed over in March. The five lists, compiled since the Commission began investigating in 2011, are understood to contain approximately 30 to 40 names each. The death toll for 2014 from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights is just the latest grim statistic from years of war. Syria's refugee crisis Conflict in numbers Noting the rise in atrocities over the four-year conflict, the Commission's report said the scale of war crimes in Syria "raises questions about the inadequacy of the response of the international community". A spokeswoman for the Commission said that the UN Security Council "was not acting" despite damning evidence of human rights abuses. "We expect really after four years that something must be done," she said.	United Nations investigators are considering revealing the names of an estimated 200 individuals suspected of committing war crimes in Syria.
For the six months to June, net profit jumped to a record $1.1bn (Â£660m) from $873m one year ago. Revenue rose by 24% to a record $3.5bn, due to higher sales volumes. The company also benefitted from a new pricing regime at its Pluto LNG project off the Western Australian coast. The price for LNG from Woodside's Pluto facility increased by 36%, and this rise was reflected in its customer contracts during the six months to June. Woodside - Australia's biggest oil and gas producer - operates six out of the seven LNG "processing trains"- also known as purification facilities, that are available in Australia. In a statement released with the earnings, chief executive Peter Coleman said: "Our record production is a testament to our assets' ongoing reliability. Our half-year profit was up 27 per cent on the same period as last year, reflecting our record production, higher realised prices and increased sales volumes." The company did not offer any guidance for the rest of the year. But it did reaffirm its recently raised production target of 89 to 94 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe). Mr Coleman said the firm's international exploration strategy was also taking shape, with new acreage in Myanmar as well as entries into Morocco, Tanzania and Gabon. Woodside's international portfolio includes interests in Ireland, New Zealand, Canada and Timor-Leste.	Australia's Woodside Petroleum has seen a 27% jump in first half profit, mainly driven by higher prices for its key product - liquefied natural gas (LNG).
Naz Shah has apologised for sharing the graphic showing Israel's outline superimposed onto a map of the US with the comment "problem solved". It was shared in 2014, before she became Bradford West MP. The Board of Deputies said the post, highlighted by the Guido Fawkes political website, was "appalling". The graphic said relocating Israel would be a "solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict", and that it would allow Palestinians to "get their life and their land back". In a statement, Ms Shah said: "This post from two years ago was made before I was an MP, does not reflect my views and I apologise for any offence it has caused." Labour confirmed she had stepped down as Parliamentary Private Secretary - an unpaid backbench assistant - to shadow chancellor John McDonnell. In a second statement, the MP said: "I made these posts at the height of the Gaza conflict in 2014, when emotions were running high around the Middle East conflict. "But that is no excuse for the offence I have given, for which I unreservedly apologise." She said she would be expanding her "existing engagement and dialogue with Jewish community organisations and will be stepping up my efforts to combat all forms of racism, including anti-Semitism". The Board of Deputies of British Jews said the comments were "simply appalling", calling for an urgent meeting "for clarification of her views on Israel and the UK Jewish community".	A Labour MP has stepped down as an aide to the shadow chancellor over a Facebook post suggesting Israel should be moved to the United States.
The couple, who have been dating since 2011, wed in front of about 10 people in Mazan, Provence - close to where the bride's family has a holiday home. Mayor Aime Navello told the Associated Press he married them at the town hall. The short service was followed by a reception for family and friends, reported to have included Righton's bandmates and actress Sienna Miller. Knightley, 28, announced her engagement to Righton, 29, last year. "Keira was a charming bride, very modest and simple in her attitude, as was James," Mr Navello told the Daily Mail. "I got the impression that it was a very moving experience for both of them." The actress, who was Oscar-nominated for her performance in 2005's Pride and Prejudice, is the daughter of playwright Sharman Macdonald and actor Will Knightley. She rose to fame in the British hit Bend it like Beckham, becoming an international star in films including Love Actually and the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. 'More interesting' Knightley also won critical acclaim for her performances in films such as Atonement, A Dangerous Method and, most recently, Anna Karenina. Later this year, she will be seen in Jack Ryan - a prequel to previous Tom Clancy adaptations - playing Cathy Ryan opposite Chris Pine. Singer and keyboard player Righton has performed with indie rock band the Klaxons since 2005. The group won a Mercury Music Prize in 2007 for their debut album Myths Of The Near Future. In an interview last month, Knightley said she did not want an extravagant wedding day. "We're not 'big wedding' types. I don't need to have all that. I'm just trying to enjoy the engagement bit. "My parents are together after 40 years. The fights are there but they love each other. "It's not like the first three months, the first two years... whatever it is, but I think it gets more interesting, or I hope so."	Actress Keira Knightley has married Klaxons star James Righton in the south of France.
Bertrand Traore, playing as a central striker, gave the Blues the lead when he took Nemanja Matic's pass, turned and fired home from 20 yards out. The Potters deservedly levelled when Xherdan Shaqiri's cross was punched by Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois to Diouf, who headed into an empty net. Bojan almost won it for the Potters in injury time but Courtois denied him. Stoke remain seventh in the table, with Chelsea 10th - three points behind them. The Blues named a team with Wednesday's Champions League game against Paris St-Germain in mind. Striker Diego Costa, who had a minor tendon injury, was not risked, while midfielder Cesc Fabregas was left on the bench. Burkina Faso forward Traore started centrally, with recognised strikers Loic Remy and Alexandre Pato on the bench, and his goal was the one real moment of quality in the game. He found space outside the box before firing a great shot past Jack Butland - his fourth goal in five games. However, he had a mixed game, failing to control the ball in the box on a couple of occasions and being caught offside needlessly. He was replaced after 68 minutes by Remy, who made little impact. Chelsea could have had a penalty when Marc Muniesa leaned on Oscar in the box but there were only muted appeals for a spot-kick. The Potters had won their previous three Premier League games and started the day five points off the Champions League places. Mark Hughes named an attacking line-up at the home of the soon-to-be dethroned champions, with Ibrahim Afellay, Shaqiri and Marko Arnautovic starting behind Diouf. When Bojan replaced Glenn Whelan, they had five forwards on the pitch. And just when it looked like their luck might be out - Courtois had done well to deny Shaqiri and Arnautovic - they got their reward. With Joselu waiting on the touchline to replace Diouf, the Senegal striker headed home after Courtois failed to adequately deal with Shaqiri's cross. That was his last touch. Hughes told BBC Sport: "That's the bit of luck you need. He put a great shift in. He was looking a bit tired so I thought I'd freshen it up. Luckily he scored just before I brought him off." Stoke boss Mark Hughes told BBC Sport: "We're grateful to equalise but we deserved more from the game. It was an excellent away performance - we took the game to Chelsea. We were encouraged by the team they picked. Media playback is not supported on this device "I was a bit surprised with their team. I thought they had a chance to get in the Champions League. "We're really pleased with the performance. Their goal came out of the blue, it was a great bit of individual skill. I felt we were a strong team and made things happen." Chelsea interim boss Guus Hiddink told BBC Sport: "Stoke play well and creatively and they pushed us back. The first goal we got after a sloppy start, it was a beautiful goal. "We should have got a penalty for a foul on Oscar. Any referee would have given a free-kick if it was outside the box. That was a key point. Stoke got some encouragement after that. Media playback is not supported on this device "We have rested one or two players but it's good to see the players who came in, especially the young ones, like Traore and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, do well. "Everyone knows in December we were one point off the relegation zone. There was a little bit of panic. Through a lot of draws at the beginning, we moved away and then we had to make the next step with victories, which we did." Chelsea's next two games will have more of an impact on their chances of winning a trophy than the Stoke fixture. On Wednesday, they try to overhaul a 2-1 first-leg deficit against PSG in the Champions League last 16, while next Saturday they go to Everton in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Stoke's next game is at home to Southampton next Saturday. Match ends, Chelsea 1, Stoke City 1. Second Half ends, Chelsea 1, Stoke City 1. Attempt missed.

Mr Tohti is an economics scholar who has criticised Beijing's policies towards the Uighur minority. He has been detained since January, after he condemned the government's response to a suicide car attack in Tiananmen Square. The United Nations, the EU and US have all called for Mr Tohti's release. He denies the charges against him. Mr Tohti, 44, is being tried at the Intermediate People's Court in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang. Prosecutors presented evidence alleging that Mr Tohti advocated that Xinjiang should be made independent. Their evidence included testimony from his former students. Mr Tohti was teaching at Beijing's Minzu University. Mr Tohti has rejected the evidence, and his lawyers say that his students' testimony were made under duress. One of his lawyers, Li Fangping, told Reuters news agency: "Most of the students said Professor Tohti had separatist goals or intentions... We believe they weren't trustworthy statements, that they were made under pressure." Seven of his students, said to have been working on an Uighur website which Mr Tohti managed, were arrested shortly after he was detained. Guzaili Nu'er, Tohti's wife, attended the trial with several of his brothers and appeared distraught, according to AFP news agency. "He has never opposed the country or any ethnic group," she was quoted as saying. "He has never done anything like that." Human Rights Watch, in a statement, said Mr Tohti had "consistently, courageously and unambiguously advocated peacefully for greater understanding and dialogue between various communities, and with the state". "If this is Beijing's definition of 'separatist' activities, it's hard to see tensions in Xinjiang and between the communities decreasing," said its China director, Sophie Richardson. Reports said the court building and surrounding streets were sealed off, with dozens of police officers standing guard, some in riot gear. Foreign journalists were not allowed inside and while some courts release details of proceedings via official microblog accounts, the Urumqi court has stayed silent. The Associated Press reported that several Western diplomats were prevented from entering and witnessing the trial. Police blocked views of the court building with tall panels promoting an upcoming trade event in Xinjiang. The trial is set to continue on Thursday. Xinjiang, which borders Central Asia, is home to the Muslim Uighur minority group. In recent years the region has seen rising tensions between Uighurs and Han Chinese migrants. Violence has increased in recent months, with deadly attacks on civilians in Urumqi and the southern city of Kunming. Last year, three Uighurs drove a car into pedestrians in Tiananmen Square, killing two people and themselves. China blames these attacks on Uighur separatists inspired by overseas terror groups. But Uighur activists say increasingly repressive Chinese rule is stoking tensions and fuelling violence. The most recent violence took place in July in Yarkant, killing 96 people. State media say police shot 59 attackers after an armed group stormed government offices, killing 37 civilians. Activists say police opened fire on people protesting against a Ramadan crackdown on Muslims. Critics say that the prosecution of Mr Tohti risks silencing moderate voices and will make the situation in Xinjiang worse rather than better, reports the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing.	Prominent Uighur academic Ilham Tohti has gone on trial for separatism in China's far western region of Xinjiang.
Stac Lee rises to 172m (564ft) above the North Atlantic and Stac an Armin to 196m (643ft). St Kildans harvested gannets and great auks from the cliffs of Stac an Armin. St Kilda's last 36 residents left the islands in the 1930s. At the weekend, Assynt Mountain Rescue Team members Bob Kerr, of Portskerra, and Tim Hamlet, of Achiltibuie, climbed to the summits of both sea stacks. The pair, who were among 12 climbers working together, managed to make their climbs during a spell of fine autumn weather. Mr Kerr said the dry conditions made negotiating droppings left by thousands of seabirds on Stac Lee a little easier. He said: "The ascent up and along the exposed ledges and the summit slope involved stepping on and moving up through abandoned gannet nests. "Thankfully there had been a period of relatively dry warm weather in the days before this trip and this resulted in the guano in the nesting areas being fairly dry and stable. "We would not enjoy ascending these slopes if the guano had been wet as it would have been excessively slippery." Once on the top of Stac an Armin, the two climbers were able to take in clear views of St Kilda and the Western Isles. Mr Kerr said: "The views across the entire St Kilda archipelago were awe inspiring as Boreary, Stac Lee, Stac Levenish, An Dun, Hirta and Soay could all be seen from the one spot. "The hills of Harris were also visible on the far horizon."	The remote archipelago of St Kilda is home to the UK's highest sea stacks.
George Verrier was treated by officers who were called to an altercation involving about 20 people in Bromley in the early hours of Sunday. He did not want to be taken to hospital, said police, but was found unconscious several hours later in nearby Ferndale. He died in hospital. A 17-year-old arrested on suspicion of murder has been released on bail. The Met said it had voluntarily referred the actions of officers who went to the scene to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) for assessment. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: "At this early stage it appears the victim suffered a head injury as a result of the altercation. "Inquiries continue to establish the full circumstances of the incident." George, a trainee electrician, was injured in Southborough Road at about 00:45 BST, while on his way home from the party in adjacent Blenheim Road. Police were called at about 09:30 BST to a home in Ferndale - about a mile away - after he fell unconscious. He was taken by air ambulance to hospital where he died at about 18:00 BST. He had been due to have his first driving lesson on Tuesday. Cornelius Moran, whose 16-year-old daughter was having the party, said: "He was a good friend of my daughter's. A lovely boy from what she tells me. "My thoughts are with the family." A woman who lives near the party venue, but did not wish to be named, said: "It looked like a very well-organised party - it was noisy, that's all. "The family who had the party are such a nice family." Another neighbour said some partygoers had been turned away from the house. He said: "We were very much aware of the noise. That stopped at about 12.30am when the music stopped. "My wife was looking out of the window and she could see three large adults leading a group of youngsters up the road, turning them away from the party."	A 17-year-old boy has died of head injuries following a fight after a party in south-east London.
Michael Tovey, 27, formerly of Lakes Road, Erdington, Birmingham is accused of using two drones to fly contraband into HMP Birmingham last year. In the first charges of their type brought by West Midlands Police, Mr Tovey faces 13 counts of conveying banned items into a prison. He is set to appear at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on 7 June. Read more news for Birmingham and the Black Country Mr Tovey is accused of using two drones to drop contraband into the prison's exercise yard on 29 October and 6 November. He attempted to drop a consignment near N and P wings containing four phones, SIM cards, Black Mamba, steroids and cannabis, it is alleged. It is claimed he was also responsible for a drone that crashed into the same yard eight days later, carrying two phones and further quantities of the same banned drugs.	A man has been charged with using drones to smuggle cannabis, steroids and mobile phones into prison.
Cpl James Dunsby's body appeared to be "shutting down" on the Brecon Beacons in July 2013. The 31-year-old's temperature was 40.4C (104.7F) - well above a normal 37C. He was one of three reservists to die from overheating on the 16-mile (26km) march on a "boiling hot" day. Cpl Dunsby, from Trowbridge, Wiltshire, died at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital 17 days later. L/Cpl Craig Roberts, from Penrhyn Bay, Conwy county, died at the scene and L/Cpl Edward Maher died about three hours later at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil. The hearing has previously been told the exercise took place on one of the hottest days of the year, with temperatures expected to hit 27C (80.6F). In a statement on the seventh day of the hearing, Welsh Ambulance clinical team leader Damon James said he did not think L/Cpl Dunsby would survive. He said he was initially told on arrival there were three people "on the hill" in cardiac arrest. Mr James added he was approached by an Army officer who told him he was in charge. Mr James said: "He told me the male (Cpl Dunsby) had been on a four-day exercise and was half-an-hour from the finish. "He said the male had collapsed about 100 yards up the track. He said they had carried plenty of water but were pushing themselves to the limit." The hearing in the Solihull, West Midlands, was also told an unnamed walker was earlier asked by an Army officer to fan down Cpl Dunsby, hold his head and watch his breathing while four other soldiers carried him on a stretcher from the hillside. The inquest continues.	A paramedic with 23 years experience said a heat-stricken Army reservist who collapsed on an SAS test march had the highest temperature he had seen, an inquest has heard.
The final stretch of the $3.8bn (Â£3bn) pipeline is being built under a North Dakota reservoir. The Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes have filed a lawsuit against the pipeline, saying it endangers their drinking water. They also say the pipeline will damage sacred burial sites. The pipeline, when complete, is expected to transport about 470,000 barrels of crude oil a day from North Dakota to a terminal in Illinois, where it can be shipped to refineries. The developer, Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) has completed most of the pipeline, and began work on the final section after the army gave it permission to proceed on Wednesday. The Standing Rock and Cheyenne River tribes asked for a temporary injunction against construction, pending a lawsuit against the pipeline. They argued that the pipeline would hurt their water supply, and prevent them from practicing religious ceremonies at the lake. However, developer ETP and the army argued against an emergency injunction, saying there was time for the lawsuit to be heard before oil began to flow through the pipeline. Construction on the pipeline had stalled for months due to opposition from protesters. Thousands of predominantly Native American protesters have demonstrated against the pipeline's construction and set up camps along the final stretch. Nearly 700 people have been arrested since protests first began last year, according to law enforcement officials. The Obama administration announced in September that it would not allow the project to proceed, but Donald Trump overturned the decision in one of his first acts as US president.	A US judge has rejected a request from two Native American tribes to halt construction on the controversial Dakota Access oil pipeline.
The 22-year-old was born in Edinburgh but has not been involved in the Scotland set-up before now. Jones plays for Cape Town-based Stormers in Super Rugby and his preferred position is centre. He comes into Vern Cotter's 27-man squad after Glasgow Warriors fly-half Finn Russell pulled out after suffering a head injury. Jones said: "I'm delighted to get this opportunity to play for Scotland. It's a dream come true. "I didn't go out to South Africa with the intention of becoming a professional rugby player, but, as my career progressed, it become more of a realistic goal to play for Scotland. "The call came as a bit of a surprise, but I'm thrilled and can't wait to get to Edinburgh next month and play my part in an exciting squad." The Scotland newcomer was educated in Somerset, but his rugby career took off on a gap-year trip to South Africa in 2012. He stayed on and helped the University of Cape Town win the Varsity Cup in 2014, scoring in the final, before being called up for Western Province Under-21s. Jones progressed to the senior team before being called up by the Stormers, for whom he has made 21 appearances. Scotland play two Tests against Japan on 18 and 25 June, with BBC Scotland providing live television, online and radio coverage.	Scotland have called up South Africa-based back Huw Jones for their June tour of Japan.
The Australian singer, 48, and English actor Joshua Sasse, 28, announced their engagement earlier this year. The couple have been vocal supporters of the "Say I Do Down Under" marriage equality campaign. The government has proposed holding a public vote on same-sex marriage in February 2017. Mr Sasse, who helped launch the "yes" campaign at the weekend, said the pair would like a wedding in Melbourne, "but we will not get married until this law has passed in Australia". "When I found out that gay marriage was illegal in Australia, I was astounded," he told Australia's Seven Network. "I simply can't fathom on any level, whether it's moral or religious or anything, that I have the right to get married and to marry the person that I love and that somebody else doesn't because of their sexual orientation."	Kylie Minogue's British fiance has said the couple won't get married until same-sex marriage becomes legal in Australia.
Pre-tax profit fell 49.7% to Â£27.7m in the first half of the year ending 30th June, The firm said its focus for the period had been operational improvements, which meant its "financial performance would inevitably lag behind". Ladbrokes boss Richard Glynn said it was now "well positioned for growth". "We have made substantial progress. We now have the products, the platforms, the people and the brand in place to deliver," he added. Ladbrokes formed a tie-up with software developer Playtech last year and as a result switched its gaming products to a new system. The firm admitted the switch over had caused more disruption than expected, but said it was now complete. Ladbrokes said it had also completed the replacement of 9,000 of its gaming machines with more sophisticated models. It also closed 46 of its "under performing" shops in the first half, nearing its target of 50 for the year. It said further shop closures beyond this were "inevitable", but it was too early to specify the number. The firm said its performance in the UK was hit by "industry-wide customer friendly results" in both the January football and horse racing in June. And it said its adherence to the The Association of British Bookmakers (ABB) voluntary industry code of conduct had also had "a clear impact on revenues". The code, which enables players to set spend and time limits on gaming machines, aims to promote responsible gambling. However, it said its World Cup performance had been "strong" with bets on mobiles up 1,100%. "The board remains confident of the outlook for the business and in delivering a result in line with its expectations for the current year," it added. Shares in Ladbrokes rose 3% in early trading. Peel Hunt analyst Nick Batram said the fall in profit was in line with expectations. "The results are unquestionably poor but they are in line with forecasts. It's also a positive narrative from Ladbrokes in that it has focused on all the things it is implementing to put it right," he added.	Bookmaker Ladbrokes has reported a sharp fall in profit, despite saying it had had a "good World Cup" performance.
Payments have been stopped to the West London Vocational Training College and its students in the Welsh capital. Education Minister Huw Lewis said there were concerns over "unusual student recruitment trends". The college said as far as it is concerned, all of its students are genuine. The Cardiff branch runs various IT and business courses and has been designated as suitable to offer HND business courses, which attract tuition fees of Â£6,000 per student, funded by the Welsh government. Students on those courses can also apply for Student Finance Wales loans and grants. Week In Week Out has been investigating offers made by a local agent recruiting for the college. Some students have been told by him they can use faked documents to access those loans and grants and they do not have to attend regularly to get the cash. He also said if they do not go on to earn more than Â£21,000, they will not have to repay the money - which is true. The college has denied any knowledge of that scam. In a statement to AMs on Friday, Mr Lewis said: "Allegations have since come to light to suggest that one or more individuals within the college may have colluded with prospective students deliberately to defraud the student finance system by falsifying academic records and records of attendance at the college. "I would expect any allegations of criminal activity to be referred to the police so that they may be investigated fully." Pearson UK - which validates colleges - carried out a review of the Cardiff campus, visiting the site on 21 October. The education minister said that "no substantive concerns came to light at that time".	Payments to a college's Cardiff campus have been suspended after a BBC Wales' Week in Week Out investigation into fraud allegations.
In Dublin, a military ceremonial event was held at the War Memorial Gardens at Islandbridge. A military service was also held at the Mall in Cork. Irish President Michael D Higgins travelled to Thiepval in France to pay tribute to the Irishmen who died while serving in the British, Commonwealth or US armies. He was accompanied by the the Irish minister for arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht, Heather Humphreys. The village of Thiepval in France is close to where the 36th Ulster Division began their attack on German lines on 1 July 1916 and is now the site of the Ulster Memorial Tower, a 70ft (21m) monument which commemorates their sacrifice. Men from all over the island of Ireland fought at the Somme, and the service in France will also be attended by representatives from the British and French governments also. Many people from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, including relatives of Somme veterans, have travelled to Thiepval for the commemoration event. The ceremony in Dublin began at 07:28 local time - the time the battle started 100 years ago. It was attended by members of the Irish Defence Forces and the Royal British Legion.	The centenary of the Battle of the Somme has been marked with ceremonies in the Republic of Ireland.
Newport's win over Accrington sees the Exiles leapfrog Pools, putting them two points in front with two games remaining. Victory for Barnet, under caretaker boss Rossi Eames, was only their second win in 13 games. But they controlled the match throughout against a side lacking in confidence, belief and ability. John Akinde was denied an opener after 12 minutes when his angled header was tipped over for a corner. From the set-piece Michael Nelson, the Barnet skipper, fired a shot against a post, while Jack Taylor's goal-bound shot was deflected wide. Nathan Thomas got Pools' first shot on target after 64 minutes, failing to test goalkeeper Josh Vickers. And the Bees went ahead in the 66th minute when Akinde turned and powerfully fired an angled drive past goalkeeper Joe Fryer. Simeon Akinola made it two five minutes later, the Bees racing away down the left side and Jamal Campbell-Ryce setting up the substitute. Akinde also missed a penalty, Fryer saving his weak spot kick with nine minutes remaining. Match report supplied by the Press Association. Match ends, Hartlepool United 0, Barnet 2.

The reaction to Taylor's death on Thursday at the age of 72, and the affection expressed for him, was the true measure of his standing inside and outside football. Born in Worksop in Nottinghamshire, Taylor was the son of a journalist and rose to prominence in the game as a manager after retiring as a player with Lincoln City in 1972. He became manager and coach at the club, winning the Fourth Division title with them before moving to Watford in 1977. It was here, in tandem with his chairman Sir Elton John, that he produced arguably his finest work, taking the club from the Fourth Division to the top flight in the space of five exhilarating years. Media playback is not supported on this device Taylor nurtured Watford legends such as Luther Blissett and John Barnes, remarkably finishing second behind Liverpool in their first season at that elite level and reaching the FA Cup final in 1984, where they lost 2-0 to Everton. Not so long ago he joked with me, with his usual broad smile: "You know I have never watched any of that game from that day to this - but I don't need to see it again to know that second goal from Andy Gray was a bloody foul on our goalkeeper Steve Sherwood." Taylor's unlikely partnership with the flamboyant rock star worked against the odds, the manager's down-to-earth approach dovetailing with his chairman's lavish lifestyle. They remained friends for life, as demonstrated by Sir Elton's heartfelt tribute. On trips abroad when he worked as a BBC Sport pundit, Taylor would gladly tell stories of that partnership, always with a laugh and underlining the genuine affection they shared. Taylor's brilliance inevitably attracted attention from elsewhere and, perhaps feeling he had achieved all he could at Vicarage Road, he left for Aston Villa in May 1987. Villa were in reduced circumstances having been relegated to the second flight. Taylor soon put that right by winning promotion in his first season - and, not content with that, rebuilt the club with such success and shrewd management that he took them to second place behind Liverpool in 1990. Taylor's methods were tried and trusted and yet he often received criticism for what his detractors perceived as "long ball" football. He, with much justification, pointed out his willingness to use wingers and flair players such as Barnes and the young Mo Johnston, whom he brought to England from Partick Thistle. England inevitably looked in Taylor's direction after Sir Bobby Robson left following the 1990 World Cup in Italy, where his side lost to West Germany on penalties in the semi-final. Media playback is not supported on this device This was, without doubt, the darkest and most frustrating period of Taylor's career and is one of the reasons his other work has been so criminally underrated over the years. Taylor took over at a tough time after the loss of England mainstays such as goalkeeper Peter Shilton and past captains such as Terry Butcher and Bryan Robson. He gave players like Alan Shearer and Martin Keown their first England caps - but he drew criticism for selecting players many simply felt were not international class, such as Carlton Palmer. England reached Euro 92 in Sweden under Taylor but produced a series of disappointing performances, going out at the group stage after losing 2-1 to Sweden in Stockholm. Taylor courted controversy and criticism in that decisive game by substituting England captain and main marksman Gary Lineker for Arsenal striker Alan Smith with a goal still needed - it never arrived and Lineker never played for England again. The manager was vilified and lampooned as a "turnip" in the Sun newspaper. The campaign to qualify for the World Cup in the United States in 1994 also ended in failure, and was brutally chronicled in the fly-on-the-wall documentary 'The Impossible Job', which gave an intimate insight into the pressures Taylor was under. Those struggles were illustrated starkly in the game that effectively sealed his fate, the 2-0 loss to the Netherlands in Rotterdam. He may have operated at the highest level but he never talked down to supporters and was always interested in how they viewed the game The tortured Taylor is seen on the sidelines pleading with officials after Ronald Koeman somehow escaped a red card for a foul on England's David Platt, only to be reprieved and score the brilliant free-kick that sent the Dutch on the way to victory. He resigned the following month and stayed out of the game until returning at Wolves in March 1994. During his spell in charge he took them into the second-tier play-offs in 1994-95, where they lost to Bolton Wanderers. Taylor left in November 1995 before returning to revisit old glories. Sir Elton John was back at the helm at Watford so it was no surprise when he turned to Taylor to come back to Vicarage Road as general manager in February 1996. It was once more the perfect fit and he was back as manager a year later, winning the third-tier title in 1998 before putting Watford in the Premier League at the end of the following season after a play-off final victory over Bolton. Media playback is not supported on this device Watford, despite an early win at Liverpool, were relegated and the following season Taylor decided to retire - only to change his mind and make a comeback at Villa in February 2002. He retired for a second and final time after they struggled the following season. It was the end of one chapter and the start of another as Taylor became a respected pundit on BBC Radio 5 live, a role he performed with total assurance and perception. Taylor was part of the radio team that covered England. It was a sign of the esteem in which he was held by fans as well as players that whenever he encountered supporters abroad, he was treated with complete respect. There was barely a reference from England followers to any of his struggles in charge of the national team. To them, Taylor was a true gentleman, to be given his due not just for his work but for his warm personality and willingness to discuss football matters with anyone he met. He may have operated at the highest level but he never talked down to supporters and was always interested in how they viewed the game. As a BBC Sport colleague, Taylor was unfailingly co-operative and the consummate professional, willing to take a call at any time, even when he was meant to be spending time with his beloved wife Rita. And as well as a fount of knowledge and a man with strong opinions, Taylor was also an endless source of entertainment and stories, just as happy to poke fun at himself as everyone else. Graham Taylor was a top-class manager at club level and a true gentleman inside and outside of football. He will be greatly missed and perhaps now his work in management, viewed through the prism of this sad news, will finally get the credit it fully deserves.	Graham Taylor will be remembered by many for his unfulfilling spell in charge of England - but by plenty more as an outstanding club manager at Watford and Aston Villa and one of the nicest, most genuine men in the game.
A group of about 400 people, made up of the 15-year-old's friends, relatives and neighbours, took part in the Wear Pink for Paige walk on Saturday. The walkers stopped at the spot in Clydebank where Paige's body was found and a single balloon was released. John Leathem, 31, has appeared in court charged with murdering Paige. He was fully committed for trial at Dumbarton Sheriff Court on Friday. He made no plea or declaration and was returned to custody. Paige's body was found in a wooded area just off Great Western Road in Clydebank at lunchtime on 21 March. The teenager was last seen near a deli in the town before setting off for her part-time hairdressing job. Hundreds of people gathered for a memorial event a Clydebank park on Saturday 26 March. The Titan Crane in Clydebank was also illuminated pink in memory of the teenager.	Hundreds of people have paid their respects to schoolgirl Paige Doherty by walking through the streets of her home town wearing pink.
Residents and an official said the victims were travelling in a pick-up truck that was targeted in the Hiran district of Hajja province. They had been heading to a local market, according to the residents. There was no immediate comment from the coalition, which is fighting the Houthi rebel movement in a bid to restore the internationally recognised government. The coalition says it does not target civilians, but the UN says air strikes have caused the majority of the more than 4,125 civilian deaths recorded since the conflict in Yemen escalated in March 2015. Wednesday's incident comes two days after a 48-hour cessation of hostilities ended. Both sides accused each other of repeated violations of the truce, which brought a brief respite from air strikes for residents of the rebel-controlled capital, Sanaa. Fighting continued in and around the south-western city of Taiz throughout the weekend, however, and on Tuesday clashes there reportedly left 11 people dead. Military officials said pro-government forces had repelled an attack on Taiz's western outskirts by Houthis and allied security personnel loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The International Committee of the Red Cross expressed alarm on Tuesday at the situation in Taiz, where some 300,000 people have been under siege by rebel forces for more than a year. "Sniper fire and indiscriminate shelling has trapped civilians. Dead bodies are in the streets and people are unable to attend to their most basic needs. The situation is desperate," said the ICRC's head of delegation in Yemen, Alexandre Faite. Mr Faite added that the main hospitals in Taiz had reported receiving an average of 200 wounded in three days. Many patients were suffering from blast injuries and had to have limbs amputated.	Twelve civilians are reported to have been killed in a Saudi-led coalition air strike in north-western Yemen.
The 8ft guitar statue has been erected in East Park, where he worked as an attendant before gaining musical fame working with David Bowie in the 1970s. Ronson led Bowie's backing band, Spiders From Mars. He died in 1993, aged 46, after developing liver cancer. His sister Maggie Ronson said: "He absolutely loved his gardening job so this couldn't be more perfect. "We're very, very happy and I'm sure he'd be very proud." More on this and other stories from East Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire Councillor Mary Glew, who unveiled the sculpture at a ceremony, said it was "a fitting tribute" to the musician who "left an enduring legacy to the world of contemporary music". The sculpture was designed by 18-year-old Hull College student Janis Skodins, whose artwork was chosen in a competition. It has been installed in the Michael Ronson Garden of Reflection, near the park's pavilion. The sculpture is among 100 plaques and memorials honouring notable people across Hull for its City of Culture celebrations. Fellow musician Trevor Bolder is also due to be honoured. As well as working with Bowie, Ronson recorded several solo albums, the most successful of which was Slaughter on 10th Avenue, which reached number nine in the UK album chart. He also played on, produced or arranged songs for artists including Lou Reed, Bob Dylan, and Morrissey.	A sculpture honouring Spiders From Mars guitarist Mick Ronson has been unveiled in his home town of Hull.
Yorkshire, Lancashire and Derbyshire have been worst affected, after 2-5cm fell overnight, with 10cm reported on higher ground. Passengers waiting to depart Manchester Airport have reported being stuck on the runway for hours due to a lack of de-icers. Leeds Bradford Airport suspended all morning flights but has since reopened. Manchester Airport reported "minor delays to departing aircraft" -  but passengers told the BBC they had been stuck on board outbound flights. Shirley Hale said her Jet2 flight to Tenerife had been waiting to depart for over four hours. "We have been told that there are not enough de-icers at the airport," she said. The airport apologised and said de-icing was the responsibility of airlines and their ground teams. More than 100 schools were closed across East Lancashire and Oldham, with 80 shut in West Yorkshire. BBC Weather said Buxton in Derbyshire saw up to 17cm of snow, the deepest measured on Friday. The avalanche risk in the Peak District was currently extremely high, Buxton Mountain Rescue Team said. Parts of Staffordshire have been affected, with several centimetres of snow reported in Flash, England's highest village. Commuters have been urged to allow extra journey time, and the Met Office has issued snow and ice warnings. More on the snow and other stories in West Yorkshire Weather updates for Lancashire and Greater Manchester BBC Weather presenter Kay Crewdson said conditions were due to slowly improve into Saturday. Molly Greenwood reported 10cm of snow in the Huddersfield area. "Don't think I'm going anywhere," she said. Zulfi Hussain said the snow was causing "traffic chaos" in Woodhall Road, Calverley, near Leeds. Elliott Hudson, another West Yorkshire resident, said: "Looks like I have woken up in Narnia." West Yorkshire's Liversedge FC, who have had to cancel every home game for the last four months due to bad weather, tweeted a picture of snow with the caption: "It's not looking good for Liversedge FC's home game with Worksop Town tomorrow." The A628 Woodhead, A57 Snake Pass and A537 Cat and Fiddle roads are all affected, with delays reported on the M65 motorway. Highways England said the A57 eastbound in Great Manchester is closed between M67/A560 and B6174  due to severe weather conditions. It said teams were working to clear the road. Tony Hallwood, from Leeds Bradford Airport, said it reopened at about 09:00 GMT after crews used ploughs to clear snow from the runway. He said: "We are asking passengers to make their way to the airport as early as they can given the difficult conditions." Bus operators are also reporting delays to all services across West Yorkshire. Oldham Council has said 48 schools had closed this morning as a result of the snow and severe weather. Drivers are also being asked to take extra care after snow fell overnight in some parts of Northern Ireland. A Met Office yellow warning for ice and snow in northern England and Wales ended at 15:00.	Heavy snowfall has caused travel disruption in parts of northern England.
The screenplay has been written by Eric Roth - who won an Oscar for Forrest Gump. Leakey is former head of the Kenya Wildlife Service and was key to stemming the trade in illegal ivory. "I've felt a deep connection to Africa and its culture for much of my life," said Jolie. Leakey's extreme measures to tackle poachers, including sending helicopter gunships into the national park, have helped Kenya's elephant and rhino populations recover from the brink of disaster. He made international headlines in 1989, when a stockpile of 12 tonnes of ivory was burned in Nairobi National Park. Jolie said Africa is about "a man drawn into the violent conflict with elephant poachers, who emerged with a deeper understanding of man's footprint and a profound sense of responsibility for the world around him". Producer David Ellison - whose company Skydance co-produced films including True Grit and Jack Reacher - called Leakey "inspirational," adding, "Africa is a story that deserves to be told". Jolie's next movie, Unbroken, starring British actor Jack O'Connell is due in cinemas later this year. She is currently directing and starring opposite her husband Brad Pitt in the film By The Sea, based on her own screenplay.	Angelina Jolie has signed up to direct Africa, a film about celebrated conservationist Richard Leakey's battles with ivory poachers.
The caves have been digitally reproduced as part of the city's first Festival of Caves. The tour will take in Mortimer's Hole under Nottingham Castle and King David's Dungeon - caves some people would not be able to access. The city has more than 500 man-made sandstone caves which have been used for dwellings and jail cells. Nottingham City councillor, Dave Trimble, said: "There are plenty of local people who don't know about the hidden world beneath their feet." He said the new virtual reality tour would allow visitors who were unable to descend the steep steps into the caves to experience them. Andrew Whitney of Hot Knife Digital Media, which developed the tour, said: "We've taken very accurate data to digitally reproduce the caves in a gaming environment. "We're excited to bring the caves into the 21st Century using the latest gaming and virtual reality technology, increasing the accessibility of these sites to everyone." A series of caves has been found in the past six years due to funded projects such the Nottingham Caves Survey, which mapped and laser-scanned many of them. The festival runs until 23 October.	Nottingham's network of caves has been turned into a virtual reality tour, to open them up to a wider audience.
Media playback is not supported on this device Malan targeted South Africa's seamers, striking 12 fours and two sixes in a 44-ball knock as England posted 181-8. Chris Jordan took 3-31 and Tom Curran - in only his second game - 2-22 to restrict the Proteas in their chase. AB de Villiers made 39 and Mangaliso Mosehle 36 off 22 balls but South Africa could manage only 162-7. England, returning to the venue of their Champions Trophy semi-final defeat by Pakistan, put in a professional performance to wrap up the series. Middlesex left-hander Malan, 29, made the highest score by an England player on T20 debut, beating Paul Collingwood's 46 in England's maiden match in this format in 2005. England, whose next white-ball series is not until September against West Indies, begin a four-Test series against South Africa on 6 July. It was a polished performance from England's bowlers, using the short ball to discomfort South Africa, and they were backed up by some strong fielding. Hampshire leg-spinner Mason Crane, who played in the opening T20 at Southampton, was put under pressure as de Villiers struck him for consecutive sixes. However, the 20-year-old showed admirable confidence as he continued to toss the ball up and was rewarded when he drew an error out of the tourists' skipper, who slapped the ball to Alex Hales on the deep square leg boundary. Crane rounded off his spell with a superb over, conceding only two runs as England turned the screw. The Proteas were lacklustre. Of the top six, only De Villiers and opener JJ Smuts (29) reached double figures and it took some big hitting from wicketkeeper Mosehle to push their total up. England's seamers were excellent, with Curran in particular showing a maturity at the end of the innings as he bowled full and straight. The result means the visitors have won only two of their six limited-overs matches on this tour. England captain Eoin Morgan chose to rest himself for the match, a decision that initially drew criticism given this was a must-win game for England, but big-hitting Malan adapted quickly to international cricket. Arriving at the crease after Jason Roy fell for eight, Malan left his first delivery but pulled the second ferociously into the stands for six. On a pitch tinged with green, he took on the short ball against the seamers. He did not let up against a change of pace, nonchalantly flicking leg-spinner Imran Tahir over his shoulder to bring up his half-century from 31 deliveries. Malan and Hales, who was struggling to run after edging the ball on to his knee, put on 105 in 10.3 overs. When Malan finally fell, caught at long-on off Tahir, stand-in captain Jos Buttler struck two flat sixes to push England above 180. Media playback is not supported on this device The manner in which England went about such a calm and assured victory will be more heartening giving the changes they made to their side. As well as Morgan being rested, England gave Crane another opportunity, as well as Curran. For South Africa, it was a disappointing return, given how strong they were in the closing stages at Taunton. They were sloppy in the field to begin with. Andile Phehlukwayo's drop to reprieve Hales on 13 was so surprising the batsman had turned to walk back to the pavilion. South Africa will take some comfort in the performance of right-armer Paterson, who was twice on a hat-trick in the final overs thanks to his mixture of yorkers and slower balls. However, it was England who controlled the majority of the game. England stand-in captain Jos Buttler: "Dawid Malan was fantastic on debut. It is not easy to come in and show that much composure under pressure. On debut it was a fantastic effort. "Mason Crane, for a 20-year-old, has got great character. He was bowling at one of the best players that have ever played the game on a ground with a short boundary. "It was very tough on him but all credit for having the bravery and guts to keep going and get the wicket. I am sure he will remember it for a long time. "We have found some really great players. You find out a lot about players - international cricket is different and those guys have stepped up. Tom Curran was brilliant for his two games. "Taunton is not an easy place to make your debut and he took three wickets and two today. He looks a real find." South Africa captain AB de Villiers: "We were outplayed in both of these series. Well done to England and Eoin Morgan in the majority of the games, and Jos Buttler today, for leading them. "England put in an all-round better performance today. We were not far off but it was disappointing. "England do have some really good youngsters. They have good depth and all round are a really good team. "They seem to be going through a good patch and have a lot of talent. They have a bright five to 10 years ahead of them." On Mason Crane: "I was always going to go after him. Well done to him for sticking to his guns." Dawid Malan, who was named man of the match: "It is a fantastic experience to play for your country and to contribute in a win like that on debut is fantastic. "I thought this day might never come. I had a chat with Adam Voges, who played later for Australia. "I asked what he did and how he kept motivated when you keep getting overlooked for younger and younger players. He gave me some advice and fortunately I had a good Lions series and got picked when players were rested."	Dawid Malan hit an aggressive 78 on debut to help England beat South Africa by 19 runs and complete a Twenty20 series victory in Cardiff.
Finance ministers have endorsed the move, which is to be completed by the end of the summer. The European Commission says nations on the tax blacklist should be sanctioned if appeals for change go unheeded. The leak of millions of files from Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca revealed how the rich and powerful use tax havens to hide their wealth. Full coverage: Panama Papers Plans for a single EU list of "non-cooperative jurisdictions" have been blocked in the past by conflicting national interests. Currently the 28 EU states have different national lists of tax havens and can decide individually whether to impose restrictive measures. Negotiations on the new common list are expected to be complex and the number of jurisdictions to be included remains unclear. Ministers have also agreed to exchange information on the beneficial owners of companies and the EU is planning a crackdown on banks and tax advisers who help clients hide money offshore.	EU nations have agreed to draw up a blacklist of tax havens in the wake of the Panama Papers leaks.
The new deal will see the 20-year-old striker stay at the club until 2019. Mead has netted 11 times in WSL 1 so far this season, including a hat-trick against leaders Chelsea, to help put her side in contention for the title. Despite being tipped for a first senior England call-up, she was not included in the squad to face Estonia in a Euro 2017 qualifier on 21 September. Sunderland have reportedly turned down a bid from Arsenal Ladies for Mead. "We're delighted that Beth has signed a new deal - she is one of the best young players in the country," Sunderland manager Carlton Fairweather told the club website. "Naturally, with a player like Beth, there has been interest from other top-flight clubs. So for us to secure this signing shows exactly where we want this club to be."	Beth Mead, the leading scorer in Women's Super League One, has signed a new four-year contract with Sunderland.
Her job brought her into close contact with Goebbels - one of the worst war criminals of the 20th century. She was one of the last surviving members of staff from the Nazi hierarchy, who only spoke about her experience later in life. In a recent documentary, she said she had known nothing of the murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust. In "A German Life", which was released last year, she said she felt no guilt - "unless you end up blaming the entire German population". Born in January 1911, Ms Pomsel worked as a writer for a Jewish insurance broker for a number of years during her late teenage years, before taking a similar job with a right-wing writer. Although she claimed that she had always been apolitical, she joined the Nazi party when they took power in 1933, in order to take a government job with German national radio. Her skill as a typist, she said, brought her to the role of Joseph Goebbels' secretary in 1942, during the war, when he was minister of "public enlightenment and propaganda". She described Goebbels as "a good looking man ... a bit short", who was always well-groomed and well-dressed - but arrogant. She said she was simply a secretary and knew little of the Nazi's brutal actions during the Holocaust. "The people who today say they would have done more for those poor, persecuted Jewsâ€¦ I really believe that they sincerely mean it," she said in interviews for A German Life. "But they wouldn't have done it either." But she always maintained that she did not share in the blame for the actions of her superiors. "I wouldn't see myself as being guilty," she said. "Unless you end up blaming the entire German population for ultimately enabling that government to take control. That was all of us. Including me." Her Jewish friend, Eva Lowenthal, disappeared in November 1943. Sixty years later, Ms Pomsel discovered she had died in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Ms Pomsel was captured by Soviet troops at the end of World War Two - and spent the following five years in detention camps, before rejoining German broadcasting in 1950, where she worked for the next 20 years. She would not speak openly about her time serving the senior Nazi official until a 2011 newspaper interview, and more extensively in the 2016 documentary. She passed away in Munich a few weeks after her 106th birthday.	Brunhilde Pomsel, the former secretary to Nazi Germany's propaganda boss Joseph Goebbels, has died aged 106.
The analysis of applications also shows big differences within the UK, with Northern Ireland youngsters the most likely to aspire to university. Within England, teenagers in London are the most likely to seek places. There are "eye-catching regional variations in demand", says Ucas chief Mary Curnock Cook. The big picture shows an across-the-board, long-term rise in young people seeking places on undergraduate courses, which seems to be recovering from a dip following the increase in tuition fees. But the figures from Ucas, based on 20 million applications between 2004 and 2013, show sharp differences behind the overall upward trend. About half of young people now apply for university places - in England this rose from 36% to 44% between 2006 and 2010. But whether a young person applies to university is heavily influenced by a number of factors, including social background, gender, ethnicity and where they live. There has been a big increase in applications from ethnic minority youngsters in England, particularly black teenagers, rising from 20% to 34% between 2006 and 2013. Chinese teenagers are the most likely to apply, followed by other Asian youngsters, with white teenagers the least likely to apply, with 29% seeking places. "Our new analysis of demand by ethnic group shows that white pupils at English schools now have the lowest application rate of any ethnic group. There has been significant growth in demand from black pupils," says Ms Curnock Cook, the Ucas chief executive. Nicola Dandridge, head of Universities UK, said the figures raised questions about "why young white men from disadvantaged backgrounds are increasingly unlikely to apply to university". "It is critical that universities continue their outreach work to ensure that anyone who has the ability and potential to benefit from a university education should have the opportunity to do so," she said. These figures show the proportion of young people in these ethnic groups who are applying - rather than the absolute numbers. Most applicants will still be white students, because it's a much larger group. For instance, Ucas says the Chinese figure is based on about 2,000 youngsters, compared with about 500,000 white youngsters. More youngsters from the poorest income groups are applying, but there are still significant gaps in terms of social background. Teenagers from the richest areas are more than four times as likely to apply to the most selective universities than youngsters from the poorest areas. Youngsters who were on free school meals are only half as likely to apply to university compared with the rest of their cohort. There are big geographical divides. In England, 42% of 18-year-olds in London apply to university, compared with 31% in the north east. London state schools have been commended for having the best results in England. Across the UK, Northern Ireland has a significantly higher level of applications than elsewhere, with 48% of 18-year-olds applying, compared with 31% in Wales. Gender remains one of the biggest factors in application rates, with females remaining substantially more likely to apply. In 2012 in England, 49% of women applied compared with 38% of men. All of these factors overlap, so that a woman from Northern Ireland is much more likely to seek a university place than a man from Wales and a white youngster from the north east of England is less likely to apply than a black teenager in London. Les Ebdon, director of the Office of Fair Access, welcomed the fact that the gap in applications between richest and poorest was narrowing. But Universities UK warned that the figures did not show applications from mature and part-time students, which have been hit by the increase in tuition fees. "Numbers of mature and part-time students have decreased considerably since 2010 and any further drop may have significant implications for potential students and the country as a whole," said Universities UK chief, Nicola Dandridge. A Department for Business, Innovation and Skills spokeswoman said: "These figures confirm that the desire to study at university remains strong, with application rates for 18-year-olds at near record levels. "Some challenges remain but no one should be put off going to university for financial reasons. Our reforms mean students do not have to pay fees upfront, there is more financial support for those from poorer families and everyone faces lower loan repayments once they are in well-paid jobs."	Black and Asian teenagers are more likely to apply to university than white youngsters in England, according to the Ucas admissions service.
The Hatters, a top-flight side 22 years ago, are 14 points clear at the top of the Conference Premier, a league they have been in since 2009 after 89 years in the Football League. Sweet told Late Kick Off East: "If you compare us to clubs that have been at a low level but are now in the Premier League and Championship - there are no boundaries for what we can achieve." Late Kick Off East will be assessing the impact of dropping out of the Football League and the difficulty of getting back up. The team will take a close look at Luton and Cambridge United, as well as the difficulties facing Northampton Town should they fail in their bid to survive in League Two. Watch Late Kick Off in the East of England on BBC One on Monday, 10 March at 23:20 GMT or on the iPlayer for seven days after Championship clubs Yeovil and Doncaster were playing non-league football as recently as 2002-03, while Premier League sides Swansea and Hull have played in League Two in the past decade. The Hatters have been a prime example of how difficult it is to come straight back up after dropping into the Conference. Their Football League status ended five seasons ago, brought on by a 30-point deduction for paying agents through a third party and failing to come out of administration. It was a third relegation in as many seasons for the stricken club. A consortium, fronted by TV presenter Nick Owen, who is now Hatters chairman, and with Sweet on board, took over the club in 2008 and have eradicated the mismanagement that exacerbated the team's swift decline. But while progress has been made in off-field affairs, four managers have tried and failed to win that elusive promotion. The Hatters are playing down the near-inevitability of succeeding this time around, but boss John Still would have to surrender a 14-point lead at the top of the table if the Bedfordshire club are not to go up automatically. "It means an awful lot more than just one league to us," said Sweet. "We feel it is the beginning of a resurgence. "We've done everything we possibly can, all the preparation is there, we just want to keep winning matches and for that green light to go. We think we can actually spin on a bit. "League Two is not the destiny of course, without appearing to be arrogant. "We took over the club in 2008 with the vision that we had 12 years to put it back into a position where we would be comfortable, where we feel our natural position in the pyramid would be. "That's not League Two - and that's no disrespect to League Two. We've served our time and I just think when we get back into League Two it will give us a bit more of an ambition." Late Kick Off will be on every Monday until the end of the season, covering the teams in your region.

23 September 2016 Last updated at 14:12 BST This was the third night of protests in the city, and the second with the National Guard on the streets, following the killing of Keith Lamont Scott on Tuesday.	Demonstrators and police have hugged and shaken hands with members of the National Guard during a night of protest in Charlotte, North Carolina.
For weeks he has come under pressure to step down as investigations continue into allegations that his wife was paid large sums of public money for a job she did not do. But having won a battle with his centre-right party, what now are Mr Fillon's chances in the fight for the Elysee Palace? He will have his work cut out if he is to claw back the lead he once held in France's presidential race. The latest opinion poll on Tuesday placed him third, on 19%, several points behind centrist Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front. Mr Fillon has stuck fast to his hard-core base for the past six weeks, as an investigation into his wife's employment whipped up a storm around his campaign. As centrist supporters deserted him in droves, he barely blinked. When his campaign manager and senior spokesman quit, Mr Fillon brushed it aside. When dozens of MPs deserted him, he retorted that he would do without them all. When polls suggested that he would struggle to reach the second round run-off, Mr Fillon ploughed on, determined to show that he retained the support of his most loyal followers. In that sense, his management of the scandal seems to have been a success. Tens of thousands of people turned out in the rain to rally around him on Sunday. But his handling of the allegations against him, and the media attention surrounding them, have also marked a sharp change in tone for France's most establishment presidential candidate, with new tactics borrowed from the populist playbook. Sunday's rally was initially described by Mr Fillon as a protest against political interference in the judiciary. He has complained of an "institutional coup d'etat", suggesting that the Socialist government is behind the allegations currently being investigated. At press conferences recently he has presented himself as the victim a "political assassination", of a "lynching" by the media, and he has accused investigators of leaking only one side of the evidence in his case. Mr Fillon has said he will leave it up to the voters to judge him, not a "biased [judicial] process". But attacking the nation's institutions while running for office has not gone down well with some party colleagues. Former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, on French radio, called it "dangerous" and "irresponsible". The man Mr Fillon beat to become Republican candidate, Alain Juppe, accused him of leading the campaign into an impasse. "He had a wide open road before him," he said. "What a waste." There was a sceptical response, too, to the claim by Mr Fillon's team that Sunday's rally had drawn 200,000 people to the Trocadero in Paris. Several journalists remarked that the plaza only held around 35,000 people when full. The claim of 200,000 is still prominently featured on Mr Fillon's campaign website. There is now talk of a "Trumpisation" of the centre-right candidate, with several commentators and news outlets comparing him to the US president. It is a very different side of a politician many saw as calm, unruffled and rather phlegmatic; "impervious to demagoguery and exaggeration", as Le Monde put it. But will the same tactics work to win back the broader votes he needs in the election itself? Mr Fillon might claim legitimacy from the people, but he is still a risk for his party. He is due to appear before a judge on 15 March and says he expects to be placed under formal investigation. Attacking the media, government and judiciary might work with his most loyal supporters, but it has driven many other voters away. If this is the new face of Francois Fillon, some might wonder what that says about the future of French politics itself.	French presidential candidate Francois Fillon has avoided an abrupt end to his campaign by securing the support of his divided Republican Party.
Mr Walsh, on a visit to Ulster University in Belfast, said: "Without question, it will be an advantage." He would prefer that the UK abolishes Air Passenger Duty (APD). But, in its absence, he said carriers within his International Airlines Group (IAG) would "certainly look at what is on offer" from Stormont. Economy Minister Jonathan Bell has promised a decision on an air route development fund by the end of next month. Potentially, it could be a Â£4m incentive package to help fund important business and tourism connections. The Northern Ireland Executive could, on its own, scrap all APD, but it would cost it at least Â£55m to repay the Treasury in lost tax revenue. Mr Walsh - a long-standing critic of APD - said it was "unfair to ask Stormont to make up the gap", adding "the chancellor should pay for it." He also expressed potential interest in Bombardier's new C-Series aircraft, which has struggled for orders and put the company under huge financial strain. He said the smaller version - the CS100 - "is possibly an option" for his airlines operating at London City Airport. "People will watch its introduction into service (later this year)," he said. "If it can demonstrate it is not just a good aircraft on paper then it will get more interest."	A Stormont fund to attract new air routes has the backing of Willie Walsh, the boss of British Airways and Aer Lingus.
Born at Alltnacaillich, Strathmore in 1714, Rob Donn could not read or write and dictated his poetry from memory in later life. A wall hanging depicting scenes from his life and work is to be created in a project led by Strathnaver Museum and Mackay Country Community Trust. People living in and around Strathnaver are to be invited to help make the piece of craftwork. Donn's poetry continues to be celebrated and studied today. Some of his work has turned into music and performed at Glasgow's Celtic Connections Festival. Strathnaver Museum has been awarded Â£5,400 from the Heritage Lottery Fund's Stories, Stones and Bones programme towards the project.	A Gaelic bard is to be remembered in needlework.
Christian, 33, captained the side during this year's tournament and will be one of their two overseas players for the competition in 2017. He averaged 41, with a strike-rate of 159.51, as Notts Outlaws won nine matches in a row in 2016. "Dan is an explosive player who hits the ball miles and played really well for us," said head coach Peter Moores. "He's also been around the T20 scene and around cricket for a long time. He brings all that experience to us, as well as a real calmness under pressure." Christian has played 174 Twenty20 matches during his career, scoring 2,549 runs and taking 130 wickets. He made three half-centuries for Notts last summer and equalled Alex Hales' record for the county's fastest half-century in T20 cricket by reaching fifty off 16 balls against Leicestershire. "Anybody who has met Dan will know he's a brilliant team-man. He gives everything and expects the same from his team-mates," Moores added. "He likes to get on the front foot, to be aggressive and to play attacking cricket, which is exactly what we want in that form of the game."	Australia all-rounder Dan Christian will return to Nottinghamshire for next summer's T20 Blast.
Rakhmat Akilov reportedly ran from the scene still covered in blood and glass, and was arrested hours later in a northern suburb of Stockholm. He has yet to be identified by police, who have only said that the man in custody is a 39-year-old Uzbek national. Even so, a picture of the man allegedly behind the attack has started to emerge: someone who had failed in his bid to get residency, lost his job and was hiding from police who wanted to deport him. Bumping into a former colleague earlier this year, he revealed he was spending his days "sleeping and smoking". According to reports, he had left a wife and four children behind in Uzbekistan in order to earn money to send home. He had applied for residency in 2014, but had been informed in December 2016 that "he had four weeks to leave the country", police official Jonas Hysing said. He did not leave and, in February, was officially put on a wanted list. A few months earlier, it is claimed he had lost his job after falling asleep at work. He had been working in construction, and was employed by Pierre Svensson for several weeks late last year, helping on an asbestos removal project. Mr Akilov was, he said, "a reserved person". "He didn't stick out. He did his job. You can't say he was very sociable, we just told him what to do and he did it. He didn't speak much Swedish," he told news agency AFP. Mr Akilov was also described as not being particularly religious. One has suggested he "partied and drank", which goes against strict Islamic doctrine. "He never talked about politics or religion," one friend told Swedish daily Aftonbladet. "He didn't pray five times a day from what I know." A co-worker agreed, telling news agency Reuters: "He was like any normal guy." Online, it seems, it was a different story. His Facebook page - which has since been taken down - is linked to a number of extremists through friends and featured at least two propaganda videos linked to IS, one reportedly showing the aftermath of the Boston bombing. He also liked a page called "Friends of Libya and Syria", which says it aims to expose "terrorism of the imperialistic financial capitals" of the US, British and Arab "dictatorships". However, he was also a fan of pages dedicated to Playboy magazine and Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova. Despite all this, Mr Akilov was not considered a threat by Swedish security services, who dismissed him as a "marginal character", apparently on the fringes of larger extremist movements.	The main suspect of ploughing a truck into a department store in central Stockholm, killing four people, had been denied residency in Sweden and had expressed sympathy for so-called Islamic State (IS), police and reports said.

A chronology of key events:
The oil giant said the majority of the staff and contractor posts would go this year, with the rest expected to be lost by the end of next year. The job losses amount to about a fifth of BP's North Sea workforce. BP said it was taking the step in the face of "toughening market conditions" but added that it remained committed to the North Sea. The cuts are among 4,000 posts BP plans to shed from its global oil exploration and drilling business. The announcement comes a day after oil firm Petrofac said up to 160 UK jobs could go under a restructuring plan. Mark Thomas, regional president for BP North Sea, said: "We are committed to the North Sea and see a long-term future for our business here. "For example, in 2016, we are continuing to invest around $2bn of capital into North Sea projects and a further $2bn in running our North Sea operations. "This will sustain many hundreds of jobs both in BP North Sea and our supply chain going forward. "However, in toughening market conditions and given the well-documented challenges of operating in this maturing region, we need to take specific steps to ensure our business remains competitive and robust. "An inevitable outcome of this will be an impact on headcount and we expect a reduction of around 600 staff and agency contractor roles by the end of 2017, with the majority of these taking place this year. "We are speaking to our staff and agency contractor management and will work with those affected over the coming months." The UK government's Scottish Secretary, David Mundell, is expected to hold talks soon with the Scottish government's energy minister, Fergus Ewing, over the announcement. Mr Mundell said: "The UK government will work with the Scottish government to ensure help is provided to those affected, including through the Job Centre Plus network. "The UK government recognises the huge importance of the North Sea, to Scotland and the whole of the UK." First Minister job Nicola Sturgeon described the job losses in the North Sea as a "crisis" for those affected but insisted that the sector had a "strong future ahead". She said: "I think it is important to note and to welcome BP's continued commitment to the North Sea. "BP has reiterated today its investment plans, both in capital investment and operational investment in the North Sea this year and has said that it sees a long-term future for its business." She said she would ensure the taskforce, which was set up last year and is chaired by Lena Wilson from Scottish Enterprise, was doing everything it could for individuals facing the prospect of redundancy and the industry as a whole. Lewis Macdonald, Scottish Labour MSP for the North East of Scotland, said the job cuts were "another huge blow" for Scotland's oil industry. He added: "With so many jobs being lost in the north east, and no sign of a recovery any time soon, it is time to reconvene the oil summit held just under a year ago and for the SNP government to spell out what their strategy is for dealing with this major crisis." Scottish Liberal Democrat MSP for North East Scotland, Alison McInnes, said "real support" was needed from the UK government if the North Sea oil and gas industry were to overcome the challenges it faced. Maggie Chapman, Scottish Greens spokeswoman on social justice, said the "need for a plan to transition the Scottish economy away from dependence on fossil fuels" had become "ever more important". John Boland, from trade union Unite, said: "This morning's announcement shows the crisis which has gripped our oil and gas sector for over a year now is far from over.  It's another hammer blow for jobs and skills. "We need an emergency convention of all the industry stakeholders - government, employers and trade unions - to tackle this crisis so we have a safe and sustainable industry for the next generation." Aberdeen City Council leader Jenny Laing said: "This is very disappointing news and a sign of the continued difficulties facing the sector, but we welcome the commitment from BP that the company still sees a long-term future in this area and is continuing to invest heavily in the North Sea." Industry body Oil and Gas UK said the plummeting oil price had impacted heavily on activity across the UK Continental Shelf. Chief executive Deirdre Michie said: "While Oil and Gas UK cannot comment on the commercial decisions made by its members, companies are having to take very difficult decisions in what continues to be a challenging time, and we, as an industry, must be thoughtful and supportive of our colleagues who are being made redundant or facing uncertainty."	BP has announced plans to shed about 600 jobs from its operations in the North Sea.
Police said they were called to Wingfield Road, Alfreton, at about 03:55 BST on Monday, where the body was discovered. Detectives said the man had suffered head injuries and has not yet been formally identified. The road was closed in both directions and police have appealed for people who were in the area between 03:00 and 04:00 to contact them. Officers also want to hear from anyone who have noticed any damage to a car that could have happened overnight.	A man has been found dead in a road in Derbyshire.
If you wanted to know what was what in the on-going shambles at Dundee United then get yourself to the Phoenix in Nethergate, that was the message. The oracle would be there in his usual spot, left-hand side of the bar, stick, maybe a dog. You'll hear him before you see him; gushing with insight and invective on the downfall of his beloved Arabs. On Thursday lunchtime we arrived at the Phoenix; a Derek-free zone. "He's not about," says the barman, who neither knows nor cares about the travails at Tannadice. All of it goes in one ear and out the other when Del is in full flight. "He's away in Iceland," says a regular. "That's where he had his accident. Skied into a tree while dressed as Santa." There's black comedy in the tale of the mysterious Blind Derek and that's fitting given why we're in town. United fans are beleaguered as never before, but they're not beyond a bit of dark humour. Theirs is a miserable plight, but they can laugh at it, too. Walking down Nethergate there's a man who turns out to be a United fan waiting to cross the road. Is he going to Dens Park on Monday night to witness the possible humiliation of his team by their city rivals? "No," he says, deadpan. "I'm going into jail for the evening. I'll get more peace in there." Thursday was a dank day in Dundee; rain and a touch of sleet. Outside St Mary's parish church, there's a man herding people into his drop-in centre. A Dundee fan, as it turns out. A grandson of John Petrie who, as an 18-year-old, scored 13 goals in Arbroath's historic 36-0 Scottish Cup victory over Bon Accord in 1885. "United could do with him," he smiles. "I'm half expecting to see some of them coming in for divine intervention. Maybe it's too late for them now. Ah, you don't like to see it. I mean that. I don't want United to be relegated." The fatalism is everywhere. There are no dreamers knocking around in the Tannadice support. Nobody has even the faintest hope of a great escape for Mixu Paatelainen's side, who will be relegated if they do not win on Monday. Fans talk about the past, which was not always glorious, that's true, but it was better than the dreadful place the club is in now. There was a connection, a feeling of togetherness, but the bond has been lost. As you go about the city and talk to the supporters the message of the shattered link between the club and its fans repeats over and over again. There's refuge from the rain in the back of Groucho's Record Shop, owned by Alastair Brodie and managed by Frank Mills - a pair of United fans since they were kids. Frank is just back in the door from Tannadice. He went to buy his early-bird season ticket and did so with a heavy heart. He's going on Monday, too. He fears he'll see his team relegated, but he's going anyway. He remembers his grandfather bringing him to watch United play back in 1962 and since the 1970s he reckons he's missed half-a-dozen home games, tops. "When you think about it; 54 years a fan," he says. "What do I feel now? I felt real anger on Sunday when we lost to Hamilton. Today, it's just resignation. So many mistakes have been made, so many disgraceful performances. "We were relegated in 1995, but it wasn't like this. That team was 10 times the side this lot are. I look at them and it's baffling. No tactics, no heart. "Jackie McNamara had to go and Mixu's been a disaster after him. I've sat in the stand and thought, 'If only we'd paid the money for Tommy Wright'. Tommy Wright would have kept us up." United fans can pin-point the moment it all started to go wrong - February 2015, when Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven were sold to Celtic. Their last game for United was a 2-1 victory over Aberdeen in the League Cup semi-final. They were sitting fourth in the Premiership at the time, three points behind Inverness but with a game in hand. They'd put 10 goals on Dundee in two games. No side, Celtic included, had scored as many in the league as United had at that point - 46 in 23 games then as opposed to 34 in 34 games now. Everything unravelled quickly. "From the minute the two boys walked out the door you could see it go down the way," says Frank in Groucho's. "Other players in that team raised their game when those two were in the side and when they weren't there anymore they just went back to being ordinary." Jim Spence has been a beat reporter in Dundee for a quarter of a century and he agrees with the timeline. "Absolutely, that was the moment, that was the killer," he says. "When those two went, it ripped the heart out of the side." United sell, as most clubs sell. John Souttar and Nadir Ciftci; Ryan Gauld and Andrew Robertson; Armstrong and Mackay-Steven; Johnny Russell, Scott Allan and David Goodwillie. There comes a time, though, when you've got little left to sell, when you burgle your bank of youth once too often. The more people you talk to about United's demise the more one name pops up. It's not McNamara or any of his players. It's not Paatelainen or any of his. It's not the failed, almost slapstick, signings of recent times, though many of them come in for heavy flak, not so much for their lack of ability but their lack of spirit. No. Stephen Thompson, the chairman, is very much at the centre of the cross-hairs. We have to be balanced about Thompson, but you'll struggle to find anybody in Dundee who'll provide it. There's been some heady times on his watch, some wonderful football, some footballers that were the envy of the country, some cup finals. Thompson reduced the debt from around £7m to just a shade over £1m now - a soft loan. He has done good work, but perception is reality and the perception of the United fans is that Thompson has fallen asleep at the wheel and has to go. There's unanimity on this. Whether it's fair or unfair is a moot point, but the United fans see no future with him. Thompson has been in America this week, looking for investors, maybe even a buyer. He's prepared to sell up, but here again there is cynicism among the support. "Up to now I've been sat on the fence a wee bit on Thompson," says Frank at Groucho's. "But the last few weeks have been so dire that you have to question everything. We need change now. The impression we get is that he's lost interest in the club. He wants to sell? He'll not get the money he's looking for. No chance." Frank says a trip to Tannadice is in order. Go to the club shop, he says. A disabled fan called Andy arrives in the shop, hands over his £150 for his season book and starts talking. "Stephen doesn't communicate with us," says Andy. "The board of the club don't know us. The link that was there is broken. It was never like this before." Mike Barile, of the ArabTRUST, is also in the shop, collecting tickets for Monday night. Barile says his mates are reluctant to go to the game for fear of witnessing the ultimate embarrassment. He'll be there, though, and, with a laugh, he says he'll be singing the anniversary song, the ditty about the Dens Park massacre of 1965 - the 5-0 drubbing that United inflicted on their city rivals when Mike was only a kid. Barile is one of Thompson's biggest critics. He, and many others, want the entire board to go. "It's totally beyond redemption," he says. "I'm critical of him because I helped get Stephen's father [Eddie] in the door and I know what a decent man his father was. The support was split then between Eddie and wee Jim McLean, but they're not split now. Nobody is backing Stephen or [director] Mike Martin or any of them. "Look at the wall there. That's a picture of Finn Dossing. He scored the hat-trick when we beat Dundee 5-0. September 11, 1965. I was only eight. That was a lifetime ago. I've never known an atmosphere as bad as we have now. Even when we didn't have a particularly good team we still had a spirit. "Everybody was in it together back then and that spirit took us through the 1960s and into the 1970s when we had wee Jim's ambition and he made us believe that we could take anybody on. And that's gone now. Gone in the last couple of years under Stephen's custodianship. Since the Celtic two went, it's been one mistake after another." Barile picks his phone out of his pocket and dials a number, hands over the mobile and tells me to talk to the woman at the other end. It's a lady called Sundie Cabrelli, wife of the late Peter Cabrelli, a one-time United player of the 1940s. Sundie is 93 years young and is still a season-ticket holder. She's going on Monday. "Oh yes, you have to go," she says. She was a fan of Eddie Thompson - "a gentleman" - but not a supporter of Stephen - "I just find him distant". Sundie doesn't like to say a bad word about anybody, but she thinks that Stephen should move on for the good of the club. "It's as bad as it's been in my time," says Jim Spence. "You have a chairman who has lost the faith of the fans and you have directors who are now coming under scrutiny and they don't like it. "I know the chairman well, I knew his father well. I told Stephen what I'm telling you. He's got a war on his hands with the fans. A deep dark hole exists. "There are constant rumours about people who are interested in buying the club, but there's always a Walter Mitty-type living in a caravan in Penicuik who claims to be putting together a consortium. "Stephen wants money to get out, but I can't imagine that any big hitter will give it to him. The club has operating losses of nearly £1m and probably more than £1m next season. Where does it go from there?" It's a question that occupies the mind of every United fan. They know how it all went wrong. What they don't know is how and when - and if - it's all going to come right again. In the meantime, for some of them, there's the slow walk to Dens, like folk heading to the footballing gallows.	Word had it that Blind Derek had all the answers.
Steven Maclean bundled home the opener five minutes before half-time. The hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee. Liam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move. And things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel. Saints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points. With game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic. This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: "It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today. "It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth. But I need braver players with more passion and desire. We controlled aspects of the game without having that ruthless edge to it. I don't think we believed today. "The main person who is not good enough is me. I am obviously not doing my job right and big apologies to the supporters. I believe we let them down today. Media playback is not supported on this device "It is not good enough. I pick the team, I pick the shape, I will take 90% of the blame for that but the players need to stand up as well." St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: "We went in 1-0 at half-time without playing particularly well but looked a threat. We looked comfortable enough and then after the sending-off, we were ruthless. We scored two and maybe could have scored two or three more. "The attitude to go and kick on and make sure we got that second goal, to make sure we weren't having any problems in the last few minutes, was excellent. "It's been a week that didn't start so well that's ended absolutely magnificently for us. We enjoy defending. We don't panic when we're under pressure. We're a good side that can do both sides of the game. "There's a better chance tonight (of finishing third) but we're not going to get carried away. We'll just keep working away. It keeps us five ahead of Hearts. It was an important result." Match ends, Inverness CT 0, St. Johnstone 3. Second Half ends, Inverness CT 0, St. Johnstone 3. Attempt missed.

The package includes a Â£250 Carer's Bonus for those looking after others for 35 hours a week or more. Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood called for a northern powerhouse for Wales in a speech at Bangor University. Meanwhile, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon visited Wales to meet business leaders. Also on Thursday, Wales Green leader Pippa Bartolotti called for the legalisation of cannabis for medical use in a speech in Cardiff. Speaking of the Lib Dems' plans, Mr Clegg said: "Our new Carer's Package will ensure society pays back the service that carers give to their loved ones and the community, easing the pressure they are under, and providing the support needed to live happier, more fulfilling lives." As for Plaid Cymru's call for a northern powerhouse, Ms Wood told students: "Devolution from London cannot stop at Cardiff Bay - there must be a devolution dividend for all Wales, for all communities. "This is especially the case for those furthest away from the capital. Wales is a community of communities."	Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg has unveiled measures to help people providing unpaid care for family and friends as he campaigns in mid Wales.
The body will also be responsible for the registration and regulation of youth support workers and work-based learning practitioners. They join more than 75,000 school and further education teachers and learning support staff on the national register. The council's chief executive Hayden Llewellyn said regulating all these groups was a "world-first for Wales". He added it was "a bold and welcome step". "By bringing non-formal and in-work education in line with formal education, we are enhancing the status of the often overlooked professions of youth work and work-based learning and the increasingly important role they play in young people's wellbeing and education," Mr Llewellyn said. Keith Towler, chairman of CWVYS (Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services), said good quality youth work "saves young lives". "The trusted relationship between young people and youth workers and youth support workers is vital for the development of resilience, self-esteem and delivery of professional responses to a huge range of issues," Mr Towler said. "Recognition of informal and non-formal learning in a wider educational context is important and this will support the development of quality youth work provision." Julie James, minister for skills and science, said the new registration system "supports our ambition to achieve the highest possible professional standards throughout the whole education sector and it will provide a vital component in ensuring the people of Wales receive high quality learning throughout their lives".	Wales' youth workers will be regulated by the Education Workforce Council for the first time from 1 April.
The world number two won 6-2 6-0 in 66 minutes and will next play Rafael Nadal, who beat Stan Wawrinka 6-1 6-4. It was a much improved performance from Murray, who broke 10th seed Raonic's serve five times. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga beat Roger Federer 6-3 2-6 7-5, and fellow Frenchman Gael Monfils beat Marcel Granollers 6-2 6-4. "It's the most challenging surface for me every year," said Murray. "It normally takes me a few weeks to remember what I need to do, how to move, the way to build up the points and making sure you don't rush." Murray needed almost three hours to beat Benoit Paire on Thursday and had struggled for form since the Australian Open in January - but he was close to his best against Raonic. The Scot, 28, dominated all aspects of the game but was especially aggressive on the return, denying the big-serving Raonic a single ace and breaking five times. "The two most important shots in tennis I did really well," added Murray. "I was getting a good read on the serve and, when he missed the first serve, I was being very offensive on the second serve return and putting him under pressure. "The serve and the return for me were the best they've been for a while and I'm glad, because they weren't so strong the last couple of matches." Jamie Murray boosted his hopes of hanging on to the doubles world number one spot for a while longer as he and Brazil's Bruno Soares reached the semi-finals. The pair beat sixth seeds Rohan Bopanna and Florin Mergea 6-2 6-3, despite Murray requiring treatment on his thigh at one stage. Murray leads Marcelo Melo by just five points in the rankings and will face the Brazilian, and partner Ivan Dodig of Croatia, in the last four on Saturday. Andy Murray and Dom Inglot had a match point but could not convert as they lost 6-4 3-6 12-10 to France's in-form Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues. Never want to miss the latest tennis news?

Alexander Young crashed his Iveco Daily van into Andrew Nisbet's parked car on 25 November 2015. Mr Nisbet, 58, suffered fatal injuries when he was struck by his own vehicle Young pled guilty to a careless driving charge at Livingston Sheriff Court. The collision happened on the B7066 Whitburn Link Road near Polkemmet Country Park. The court was told that Mr Nisbet's car was parked with its hazard warning lights flashing when the accident happened. Young, 62, of Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, admitted failing to observe Mr Nisbet's car and colliding with it. Police said at the time that the van driver had suffered only minor injuries in the crash. Mr Nisbet, from Sauchie, Alloa, was married with a family. He was described him as "a much loved husband and father" who would be sorely missed.	A van driver who crashed into a stationary car, fatally injuring its driver, has admitted careless driving.
Some argue that Africans have never had so much artistic freedom, with a proliferation of books, paintings and films since the advent of multi-party democracy in the 1990s, and the huge advance in technology which has allowed anyone with a smartphone to publish their views across the world. But critics say artists are still subject to tight censorship, pointing out that a South African gallery was forced to remove a painting of President Jacob Zuma under political pressure, while in Uganda a play about gay rights was banned. So, just how free are Africa's artists - in film, literature and music- to tell their own stories? Here are some of their experiences: Having been born and raised in Uganda, it was the best place to be. It was my home and my everything. I remember joining the film industry in 1999 - everything was still good. You didn't need a licence to shoot a film, no censor body to look at your script. All you had to do was get a camera, run to the streets, shoot something and lock yourself in the edit suite - and later put your work out there for the world to see. Today, I have grown to understand that not all stories can be told and not just any film can be done here. There are topics you have to think twice before tackling or which, for your safety, are better left untold. Topics that will get even actors saying: "I think I am not the right person for that role" even when you know they can pull it off. Here, you don't just wake up to say you are doing a film about the gay community, a film about the political situation, or a film that paints a bad picture of Uganda. One day I had to drop a story that was inspired by the practice of female genital mutilation amongst some communities in Uganda. I had strong interviews and had done thorough research, but everyone kept telling me it was not safe to go ahead. But it is still my home, my Uganda, my everything. I don't think anyone is free to exercise their art. And that includes artists. There is a cost for this freedom. Artists are no different to the entrepreneur in that financial resources are required for the capital outlay of the "work" or manuscript. Just to be in a position to indulge in the work is time spent creating a product without the immediate benefit of financial return. Then the work needs to be produced depending upon the format and genre, requiring additional resources. In the case of a writer, it is then given to a publisher, who spends even more resources to fine-tune the manuscript with an editor, proof reader, type setter, graphic designer etc. which could take considerable time before it is placed on the retail shelf. Since the work now becomes a joint investment, compromise is inevitable. So, I guess artists are free to tell their story if they have the resources to indulge in this freedom. There is a preconceived notion and expectations regarding African films. Only in recent years have young filmmakers begun to break the mould and make more experimental films. Funders have a clear idea of the African films they want. In most instances, those that depict African people in an unconventional light are not the stories funders and international festivals want to see. They are content to see Africa as a struggling continent, which is corrupt and disease-ridden. Many urban African stories don't ever reach beyond Africa because of the question: "Are those really African stories?". The image and perception of African film is still very narrow. I want to tell African fantasy and surreal films, but the reaction is: "Why? Don't you have more important issues that you need to address in your films?" Each African film-maker has his own story to tell and we need to allow the "strange for Africa" films to co-exist with those that speak of identity, cultural and moral injustices, war, HIV/Aids etc. But things have changed slightly and filmmakers are finding alternative sources of funding - for instance, private investors - to tell stories they are passionate about. Are artists free to tell their own stories? This is a conscious choice each artist has to make. However, in the developing world, with most artists relying solely on their practice for their livelihood, they are forced to compromise their genuine stories with some "fabricated reality" that is sellable. This is further fuelled by the common perception that sales equal success, which leaves us caught up in creating fairy tales for sale. In oppressive environments, artists are intimidated and live in fear of censorship or consequences of defiance. In Kenya, having recently switched from the stereotypical African dictatorship that clamped down on creatives (mostly writers) to a more liberal government, artists whose work was inspired by bad governance, stemming from from semi-illiterate leadership, now have trouble remaining relevant. Tune in to the BBC World Service at 1900 GMT on Friday 1 March to listen to the BBC Africa Debate - Are artists free to tell their stories? - broadcast from Ouagadougou. Or take part in Twitter - using #bbcafricadebate -  Facebook or Google+ Africa Debate The whole funding situation further complicates the scenario. There's a big chunk of "development" aid and "human rights" funding channelled through non-governmental organisations. A handful of very prolific artists have gone mercenary. They've stopped making good art and have started championing the causes of civil society groups because the money is good. Artists are very free to tell their stories. A lot of factors may determine whether they do but in spaces with rampant poverty, very few can resist the temptation of a fistful of dollars to tell someone else's story. Artists just have to believe that their own stories are good enough. Filmmakers, unlike other artists such as painters and dancers, need money to practice their craft. And African filmmakers are especially burdened by a lack of money because our societies are financially strapped and they historically undervalue art. Our governments have different priorities and our businessmen see no financial value in supporting art. So African artists often find it impossible to tell their own stories. One way around that difficulty, I find, is crowd-funding. With many people making small donations, an artist can raise enough money to see through a vision that would otherwise be impossible to realise. That is how I completed my debut feature, Ninah's Dowry. But the lack of a speedy internet structure and limited access to credit cards still make crowd-funding a challenge on the continent. Another not-so-obvious deterrent to an artist's freedom is the requirement by some governments that artists submit scripts for approval before filming permits are granted. It is understandable for my beloved Cameroon, for example, to be touchy about military sites appearing onscreen. That is a credible national security issue. But, what happens if the artist's screenplay is critical of his government or country? Belonging to a very traditional society with conservative cultural values, I always have to make sure that what I say or what I do does not offend certain sensitivities. Which is not easy when you realise that the Festival in the Desert, while looking outward to the modern world, is organised by an indigenous people from a very traditionalist milieu. With the occupation of a large part of Mali and the prohibition of any form of artistic expression such as music, things became much more difficult. Expression itself was extremely risky because you exposed yourself to various punishments from the occupiers - including imprisonment. Even on the international level, to denounce what was happening could bring you trouble. At first you may be labelled as "an enemy of Islam" with all that implies in consequences for your daily life. However, this does not intimidate us because we are convinced that what we do is not against Islam. Our struggle is to show the values that are held by the majority of Muslims in the world, values of sharing and of tolerance. In its comparatively short history, African cinema has been viewed with considerable apathy and condescension both at home and abroad. No post-colonial African state in the continent has attempted to develop a cultural or film policy that incorporates critical debates, political and the poetic, since former Senegalese President Leopold Senghor's 1960s attempt with his idea of "Negritude". With funding intertwined in various governmental departments and international development resources, film-makers are often forced to avoid making films dealing with their immediate surroundings. Instead, they produce films that are neither critical of social problems and national politics nor entertaining. That said, digital storytelling has presented film-makers with essential tools to battle for the freedom to create and distribute their work. In the last 10 years, young Africans have brought amazing energy to drama by embracing digital technology and therefore producing work that has been able to reach its audience across multiple platforms providing film-makers the freedom to imagine and free from the global hegemony.	Fespaco, Africa's premiere film festival, is taking place in Burkina Faso this week, amid debate about artistic freedom on the continent.

Chasing 273, England collapsed from 100-0 to 164 all out, with Mehedi Hasan taking 6-77 and Shakib Al Hasan 4-49. They earlier dismissed the hosts for 296 after dropping four catches. Bangladesh had only beaten Zimbabwe and a weakened West Indies team in 95 previous Tests, but the 108-run win means the series finished 1-1. England needed their highest successful run chase in Asia and looked well set after a century opening partnership between Alastair Cook and Ben Duckett. But they lost all 10 wickets in 22.5 overs in the final session as Bangladesh secured the biggest win in their history. Bangladesh had lost 72 of their previous Tests and last played in August 2015 because of security concerns in the country. Duckett (56) scored his first Test half-century but was bowled by 19-year-old off-spinner Mehedi with the first ball after tea, prompting the stunning collapse - the third worst in history by a team who had been 100 without loss. Joe Root was lbw in the following over to Shakib, before Gary Ballance and Moeen Ali were dismissed in the same Mehedi over shortly afterwards. Cook made 59 but, despite successfully overturning one dismissal, the England captain was caught off Mehedi by Mominul Haque at silly point. Shakib then dismissed Ben Stokes, Adil Rashid and Zafar Ansari in quick succession. Fittingly, Mehedi took the final wicket of Steven Finn to finish with six in the innings, 12 in the match and 19 in the series. Openers Cook and Duckett, who batted together for the first time in the first Test in Chittagong, had only managed a best partnership of 26 in their previous three innings. Duckett, 22, impressed with an aggressive 56, hitting seven fours and a six, and played a number of reverse sweeps and pull shots. Bangladesh bowled all four spinners in the session leading up to tea but they took no wickets in helpful conditions. Cook had scored four, 12 and 14 in the series but also batted fluently in a period that seemed to swing the game in England's favour. England will rue their failure to take early wickets as Bangladesh added 116 runs in the morning session and Cook's side dropped four catches. Imrul Kayes scored 78 but was dropped at leg slip by Cook off Ansari, and then by Root off Moeen in the first 10 overs of the day. Both were difficult catches but Duckett dropped a simple chance at deep mid-wicket later in the session with Shakib the batsman to benefit. Finn also put down a difficult diving chance, while England chose not to review the umpire's decision on two occasions when replays showed the batsman would have been given out had they done so. Kayes' innings and 41 from Shakib helped Bangladesh to 268-7 at lunch, but Stokes (3-52) and Rashid (4-52) helped England knock over the tail in 26 balls after lunch. Media playback is not supported on this device Former England spinner Vic Marks on BBC Test Match Special That was extraordinary. I don't think I've seen a series where it's been impossible to know who's winning. At tea time we were praising Duckett and Cook, but less than two hours later the match was over. I've not seen the mood change between sessions like that before. Ex-England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent I feel emotional for Bangladesh. There were all these issues about security and there were doubts about the series taking place. The people here were all so happy that England came. This is unbelievable. Former Bangladesh all-rounder Athar Ali Khan That was a very special win for Bangladesh. I think 160 million people in Bangladesh will have been glued to the TVs, radios and phones. I feel privileged to be here to have seen it.	Bangladesh claimed their first Test win over England as the tourists lost 10 wickets for 64 runs after tea on day three of the second Test in Dhaka.
He suffered a stroke two weeks ago and his condition improved before a sudden deterioration on Tuesday. Mr Peres, who was one of the last of a generation of Israeli politicians present at the new nation's birth in 1948, served twice as the country's prime minister and once as president. He won the Nobel Peace prize in 1994 for his role negotiating peace accords with the Palestinians a year earlier. He once said the Palestinians were Israel's "closest neighbours" and might become its "closest friends". Obituary: Shimon Peres, Israeli founding father Long legacy of Israel's elder statesman Mr Peres died in a hospital near Tel Aviv early on Wednesday, with his family at his bedside. He had been in the intensive care unit of the Sheba Medical Centre after suffering a major stroke on 13 September. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his "deep personal grief on the passing of the beloved of the nation". Meanwhile US President Barack Obama called Mr Peres his "dear friend" in a statement, and said: "He was guided by a vision of the human dignity and progress that he knew people of goodwill could advance together." Mr Peres shared his Nobel Peace Prize with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was later assassinated, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. At the start of his long political career, he was put in charge of personnel and arms purchases for the Haganah, the predecessor of the Israel Defense Forces. He secured a deal with France to supply the new Israeli nation with Mirage jet fighters. He also set up Israel's secret nuclear facility. He was the defence minister in 1976, when Palestinian hijackers diverted a plane from Israel to Entebbe in Uganda. He oversaw the successful rescue of more than 100 hostages. Once an advocate of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, Mr Peres later became a leading political dove. He often spoke of the need for compromise over territorial demands in Palestinian areas. He maintained an active public schedule into old age, mostly through his non-governmental Peres Centre for Peace, which promotes closer ties between Israel and the Palestinians. In 2013 he said: "There is no alternative to peace. There is no sense to go to war." He retired from his role as president in 2014.	The former Israeli PM and president, Shimon Peres, has died aged 93.
Work was due to begin this week on demolishing Prestatyn Community Hospital which closed two years ago.

Seagulls have come to the aid of campaigners fighting to save a former hospital from immediate demolition.
The firm said that it was working to boost capacity at telephone exchanges in the worst hit areas. The news coincided with the launch of Sky Go Extra - a service allowing users to download movies and TV shows so they can be watched offline. One expert said the product might add to the strain. Sky Go Extra still works at slow internet speeds - however, Sky's other streaming services rely on the user having a 2 megabit per second connection. Some subscribers have complained their download speeds have fallen below this level at peak times. A Sky spokeswoman apologised for the problems. "Following a combination of an underlying increase in network traffic as well as a high rate of new customer additions, we are aware of capacity issues in a small number of exchanges," she said. "We are working on adding new capacity to those exchanges as quickly as we can. We apologise to all customers who have been impacted by this issue." She confirmed a report by The Register that users in Doncaster, North Wales and Bristol were among those affected, but declined to be more specific or name other locations. However, the firm has provided an online postcode checking facility for its subscribers to check if their local exchange has been flagged as having an issue. Sky also indicated that less than 5% of its broadband customer base used the affected exchanges. Andrew Ferguson, editor of the Thinkbroadband news site noted that Sky had recently run a major promotion highlighting the fact it did not place "fair use" caps on the amount of data its customers use. As a result, he said, the firm had probably attracted subscribers who downloaded significantly more than the average 23 gigabytes per month consumed by the average UK broadband user. "Sky had this problem last year in some of its exchanges, and it's definitely not the only service provider to have experienced this problem," he told the BBC. "It's very much related to the firms' promotional activities. Sky has also been pushing its fibre products recently - they offer higher speeds and people who sign up generally use more data afterwards."	Sky has acknowledged that some of its customers are experiencing slow internet speeds as a consequence of it signing up new subscribers.
Ineos wants to conduct seismic surveys at Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire to see if there is potential for fracking. The firm said the charity had blocked any contact for almost a year and it was considering seeking a court order. The National Trust said it opposed any activities leading to the extraction of fossil fuels, so rejected requests. Moves to look for shale gas in the Sherwood Forest area have proved controversial due to environmental concerns over extraction - known as fracking - and expansion of fossil fuel use. Ineos said it already had permission from nearby landowners for the the non-invasive survey and its ability to extract gas would be "significantly limited" if it could not get on to Clumber Park. "If the National Trust refuses to change its position, Ineos will have no choice but to write to the Oil and Gas Authority, asking for permission to seek a court order enforcing its rights to carry out these surveys on National Trust land," it said in a statement. The company said government licences gave it a legal obligation to investigate shale gas deposits around the country and criticised the charity's position as "overtly political" as shale gas had lower carbon emissions than either oil and gas. A National Trust spokesman said: "The National Trust is opposed to fracking on its land and will reject any fracking requests or inquiries. "Consistent with this, we say no to surveying on our land for fracking purposes."	A petrochemical company is threatening legal action over the National Trust's refusal to allow testing for shale gas on its land.
The huts, made of chalk and straw daub and wheat-thatched roofing, have been based on archaeological remains found at Durrington Walls, near Stonehenge. Project leader Luke Winter said: "What we're trying to do is get a sense of what these buildings looked like above-ground." The hope is to re-build the huts at Stonehenge visitor centre next year. "What makes the buildings interesting is that they were dated to about the same time as the large sarsen stones were being erected at Stonehenge," Mr Winter said. "One of the theories is that these may have housed the people that were helping with construction of that monument." Inside, the project team has used a variety of different daubs, made of pig soil [dung] or chalk and straw and construction techniques that would have been used by  Neolithic people. "We've been trying a completely different way of thatching a roof. Nothing is tied onto the roof, as you would in a modern thatched building but the wheat straw that we've used is knotted and then tucked into a woven framework. "Often people think 4,500 years ago is a long time ago, which of course to us as modern people it is, but it's well into beginnings of agriculture. "We're looking at people that were farming, keeping cows and domesticating cereal crops, and of course houses were an important thing." The Neolithic huts will be kept for another two months and will open to the public during the two May bank holidays.	Three Neolithic-style huts have been built at Old Sarum to offer an insight into how Stonehenge's builders lived.
He made more than 40 feature films in a career spanning 60 years. Many of his films - including Kanal, Man of Marble, Man of Iron and Katyn - were inspired by Poland's turbulent wartime and communist history. In 2000, Wajda was awarded an honorary Oscar for his contribution to world cinema. Wajda had been recently taken to hospital. Unconfirmed reports say he died of lung failure. Wajda's last film Powidoki (Afterimage) tells the life story of the avant-garde painter Wladyslaw Strzeminski, who suffered under the post-war Stalinist government in Poland. The director said he wanted to "warn against state intervention in art". The film was recently chosen as Poland's official entry for the best foreign language film at the 2017 Oscars. Four of Wajda's earlier works had been nominated for that category. Man of Iron won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1981. Wajda once said that "the good Lord gave the director two eyes - one to look into the camera, the other to be alert to everything that is going on around him." Wajda was born in 1926 in the north-eastern Polish town of Suwalki. His father was among the victims of the Katyn massacre of Polish army officers by the Soviet Union in 1940. Wajda tried to follow in his father's footsteps, but was rejected by a military academy, and joined the Polish resistance in World War Two. During World War Two, Wajda joined the Polish resistance. He later studied to be a painter, before entering the Lodz Film School. In 1955, he made his feature film debut with Generation, set during the German occupation of Warsaw in World War Two.  It was followed by Kanal, and Ashes and Diamonds, which form a trilogy about life in wartime Poland. Some of his films found disfavour with the communist rulers of Poland because of their trenchant portraits of the wartime Warsaw Uprising and the suppression of the Solidarity movement in the 1980s. It was only after the fall of communism in 1989 that he was able to make his film about Katyn. "I never thought I would live to see the moment when Poland would be a free country," Wajda said in a 2007 interview with the Associated Press. "I thought I would die in that system. It was so surprising and so extraordinary that I lived to see freedom." Following Poland's first free elections in 1990, he served for two years as a senator in the upper house of parliament.	Oscar-winning Polish film director Andrzej Wajda has died aged 90, the Polish Filmmakers' Association has confirmed.
Ukrainian officials said inventory work began on Saturday morning with the actual pullback to start in the afternoon. The rebels in the Luhansk region said they were withdrawing tanks. Both sides have committed to pulling out materiel carrying weapons with less than 100mm (4in) calibre. The rebels in the Donetsk region were quoted as saying that they would start pulling out their weapons on 18 October. The withdrawal process is yet to be verified by international monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). The pullout date was announced at a meeting of leaders from Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany on Friday. Moscow denies sending troops and heavy weapons to the pro-Russian separatists. However, the Kremlin admits that Russian "volunteers" are fighting alongside the rebels in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. In a separate development, OSCE monitors said in a statement on Friday they spotted the powerful TOS-1 Buratino multiple rocket launcher in Luhansk. A spokesman for the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine told the BBC the discovery was particularly significant because of the damage the rockets could cause. The rebels have not commented on the OSCE report. Ukraine crisis: Russia tests new weapons Ukraine 'can't stop Russian armour' In Paris, Russian President Vladimir Putin met Ukraine's Petro Poroshenko, France's Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the first time since they agreed a peace deal for Ukraine in Minsk in February. The so-called Normandy Four meeting assessed all elements of the deal, including the staging of local elections in the rebel-held regions and the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the line of contact. After the meeting, Mr Hollande said the pullout would start on Saturday, with Mr Poroshenko later confirming this in a statement (in Ukrainian). Mr Poroshenko said this process would then continue in stages and should be completed within 41 days. He said the 100m calibre pullout would include not just artillery pieces "but also tanks and mortars". Regarding the elections in the rebel-held areas, the French leader said they must be held according to Ukrainian law, as envisaged in the Minsk peace deal. Mr Poroshenko said the four leaders had supported the idea of the elections based exclusively on Ukrainian legislation and in the presence of OSCE observers, who should be granted full access. However, the rebels said before the Paris talks that they still intended to proceed with staging local elections on their terms. Kiev says such elections - to be held on different dates from the rest of Ukraine and not according to Ukrainian law - would be "fake". A ceasefire in eastern Ukraine has been holding since September, although there have been reports of occasional shelling. The clashes in the Luhansk and Donetsk region began in April 2014, a month after Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula.	Ukraine's government forces and pro-Russian rebels say they have begun withdrawing weapons from the line of contact in the east of the country.
Wales wing Hallam Amos scored two fine tries in the second half while Dorian Jones kicked five points for the hosts. But Hamish Watson's touchdown, plus eight points from Sam Hidalgo-Clyne and a penalty from Blair Kinghorn, proved enough for the visitors. Edinburgh move to within four points of rivals Glasgow in sixth, though the Warriors have a game in hand. The Dragons had 20-year-old Wales centre Tyler Morgan and fly-half Dorian Jones back from long-term injuries, while Taulupe Faletau returned from Wales duties. Edinburgh scrum-half Hidalgo-Clyne was making his 50th appearance while the visitors also paraded their Scotland front row. On a muddy surface, the first half produced only penalties, with two from Hidalgo-Clyne and one from Kinghorn on target for the visitors, while Jones kicked one for the Dragons. Flanker Watson wasted a golden chance for the Scots after 24 minutes as he went for the line rather than using the men free outside. The Dragons started the second half at a higher tempo and after barely a minute, Amos sprinted through a gap to score with Jones' conversion giving them the lead. But Edinburgh struck back in their next attack as Watson wrestled his way over from a line-out drive and Hidalgo-Clyne put over the angled kick. Amos then produced a superb finish from 30 metres out when given an overlap from man-of-the-match Faletau's pass. But that unconverted score after 53 minutes proved to be the last of the match. Edinburgh kept the Dragons pinned in their own half in the final quarter but Hidalgo-Clyne was off target with two more penalty attempts as they failed to make their pressure pay. It was the Welsh side's ninth losing bonus point of the season, including five in the last six matches. Dragons host Ospreys on Friday in their final game at Rodney Parade this season, before their European Challenge Cup quarter-final at Gloucester on 9 April, while Edinburgh host Zebre on Friday.

An invoice for £170 was sent to subscribers to the Scotland Supporters Club mailing list just after 09:00. The email - addressed "Dear Customer" - provided a link for payment, which was a disguised website address. The SFA said a third-party email database had been compromised and urged recipients to delete the email. Its statement said: "We would like to apologise to those who have received a spoof email this morning purporting to be from the Scottish FA." It recommended that anyone who may have opened it run a security check on their computer to ensure no malware had been installed. It said: "We would like to assure all supporters that no bank or credit card details have been shared. "We have moved to delete this account and the issue has been raised with our suppliers. "We will provide an update in early course." Fans on message boards suggested that clicking on the link within the scam email could infect computers with a virus and leave them out of pocket. The email contained links identical to those sent on official communications to supporters and were signed off as being from the "Accounts Department" of the Scotland Supporters Club. The group - which gives members access to away tickets for Scotland matches - currently has 29,231 members.	Thousands of football fans were sent a scam email asking them to pay a bill after a Scottish Football Association database was apparently hacked.
The builder said it would construct 139 homes at Duddingston Park South, Duddingston, and 165 at Newcraighall Village. Barratt Homes will also build a total of 102 affordable homes between the two developments. Newcraighall Village and Duddingston Park South are both set to launch later this year. Anne Ross, sales director at Barratt Homes for the East of Scotland, said: "2014 has been buoyant year for new homes sales and we are pleased to be launching these two new developments in the Edinburgh area, to allow us to keep up with demand. "With a wide selection of modern homes on offer and in sought-after locations, we hope these developments will be extremely popular."	Barratt Homes has confirmed it is pressing ahead with plans to build 400 new homes in the east of Scotland.
Michael Gunn, a retired chartered accountant, wants to spend some of it on a new roof for the church hall. But in defiance of experts, he also wants to use the money for a transatlantic cruise. The changes take effect on Bank Holiday Monday, so Mr Gunn will receive the payment on Tuesday morning. "I had no idea they'd whisk me into the limelight, and say I am the first," he told the BBC. "But I don't mind that." Initially he wants to donate cash to the fund for the church hall roof - in the village of Newton Poppleford - after it burnt down in a fire. But later in the year he is planning to take his wife across the Atlantic on board the Queen Mary Two. Mr Gunn was not prepared to say how much he would be taking out of his pension pot, but he has taken care to heed warnings about tax bills. "What I like about this is that you are totally in charge of how much tax you are exposed to - to stay within a lower tax band," he said. Last week the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said thousands of people withdrawing money might find themselves paying much more tax than they needed to. Other experts have pointed out that, in any case, people taking out cash will have to pay what is called "emergency tax". Unless individuals can show a P45 tax form, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will treat any payments as if they are a new monthly salary. In other words, they will charge tax on the basis that the new income is repeated every month for a year. So anyone cashing in a pension of Â£18,000 - assuming nothing is taken tax-free- would be charged an immediate tax bill of Â£6,592. Those in that position will have to reclaim the tax using forms P50 or P53. However HMRC has promised they will get the money back within a month. Meanwhile, hundreds of staff from Citizens Advice - and Citizens Advice Scotland - are preparing to offer free face-to-face interviews with anyone who needs help, from Tuesday. Those aged 55 or over can go to one of 500 offices in England and Wales, or 90 in Scotland. Those living in very remote areas of Scotland can arrange home visits. But customers will only receive "guidance", not advice. "What we don't do is provide any details of which companies people can go to for pensions - or which particular products," said Richard Chilton, one of those who will be conducting the interviews. "But we provide guidance on what the options are," he said. Anyone wanting to book an interview, or receive telephone guidance, should call the Pension Wise service, on 030 0330 1001.

Scrum-half Murray took a heavy blow to the head in a tackle but was allowed to return to the field after belatedly being sent for an assessment. However, Munster say Murray showed no signs of concussion. Recently, Northampton were found to have breached rules by allowing George North to play on after a head injury. Sale are currently being investigated for an incident involving TJ Ioane. European Cup organisers confirmed to BBC Sport that an Untoward Incident Review Group will convene early this week to decide whether Munster had broken concussion management protocols. Munster insist Murray was assessed at the time of the incident and did not appear to be concussed. The club said upon further review of the footage by Munster medics, he was removed for a head-injury assessment as a precaution. He passed that and returned to the field of play and subsequently passed a second head-injury assessment after the match. The 14-12 victory over Glasgow means Munster are now guaranteed to top Pool One, sealing a quarter-final place in Europe's elite tournament for the 16th time in 22 seasons.	Munster will be investigated over their management of Conor Murray's head injury in the European Champions Cup victory over Glasgow on Saturday.
Captcha checks typically ask people to complete a puzzle that a computer would struggle to complete correctly. They are designed to stop automated bots accessing and using websites. Google's new system tracks how a person interacts with a website to prove they are real, so the puzzles are no longer necessary for most people. Captcha checks are often deployed by concert ticket websites to stop people setting up automated bots to buy all the best tickets. They also appear when somebody is trying to log in to a website with the wrong password, to spot automated attempts. The puzzles present challenges that people find simple but computers can find more difficult, such as: The puzzles also benefit companies such as Google by helping train artificial intelligence algorithms. For example, if Google's AI can not recognise a house number in a photograph taken by a Streetview car, it may add the photo to its Captcha system to get human input. However, genuine users can find the interruption by puzzles a nuisance. Google's reCaptcha system has already simplified the process by asking users to tick a check box on the website they are using. The box monitors how each person has interacted with it, to separate natural human clicks from bots. For example, an automated script might take just a second to fill in a form on a website, and may not move the mouse at all during the process. Google's latest development removes the check box as well, and instead analyses how people have interacted with other elements on a website such as the "submit form" button. However, in some cases "suspicious" activity will still trigger a puzzle.	Website security checks that challenge people to prove they are human are likely to "disappear" in favour of a new system developed by Google.
Burberry rose 2.81% on speculation that the company could be takeover target for a US private equity firm. Mining shares were hit by a number of broker downgrades following recent falls in commodity prices. At close of trade in London the FTSE 100  index of leading blue chip stocks was ahead by 77.95 points, or 1.12%, at 7015.36. Anglo American shares fell 0.24% after Credit Suisse cut its rating on the company to "neutral" from "outperform". Downgrades also hit BHP Billiton, which fell 1.09%. Credit Suisse cut its rating for BHP to "underperform" from "neutral", while Investec downgraded to "sell" from "hold". On the currency markets, the pound fell 0.83% against the dollar to $1.4743 but was up 0.17% against the euro to ???1.3813. Sterling was weakened by the latest UK trade figures, which showed the trade deficit widening by more than expected in February. The Bank of England kept UK interest rates on hold at 0.5% - as expected - following its latest meeting.	(Close): Fashion house Burberry led the market higher following speculation that it could be a bid target.
President Thein Sein said the deal had opened up the "road to future peace" in Myanmar, also known as Burma. But the most active of rebel groups have not signed the agreement, which comes after two years of negotiations. Myanmar has been engaged in armed conflict with various ethnic and other groups seeking greater autonomy since independence from the British in 1948. The violence has left tens of thousands dead over the years, displaced hundreds of thousands more and has been used by the military to justify its long hold on political power. Resolving the conflicts is seen as central to Myanmar's attempts to reform after decades of military rule. The government hopes Thursday's deal - which comes weeks ahead of general elections - will be the first step on a path to a lasting political settlement. Speaking at the lavish signing ceremony in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, Thein Sein said it was a "historic day for Myanmar". "We have been able to launch a new road to a peaceful future of our country." The chairman of one of the armed groups, the Karen National Union (KNU), called it "a new page in history and a product of brave and energetic negotiations". The agreement is neither truly nationwide nor strictly speaking a ceasefire. In order to take part in this collective agreement the armed groups had to have previously signed a bilateral ceasefire with the government. So it is not actually halting any conflicts. This at times tortuous process has been about trying to get everyone to the start line before the next phase, political dialogue, gets under way. With only about half the groups having made it to the start line, the way forward from here will be ever more complex. Read more: Ceasefire marks milestone for Myanmar But seven of the armed groups which have been involved in the talks did not sign the final deal. Among them is the largest, the United Wa State Army (UWSA), which has some 25,000 members operating on the border with China, and has largely remained on the sidelines of the talks. Also not signing was the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO), whose Independence Army (KIA) controls large areas of north-eastern Kachin state and has regularly clashed with the Burmese army since a ceasefire collapsed in 2011. Thein Sein said the government would "continue with our efforts to bring the remaining organisations into the process". "The door is open for them," he said. Political discussions are now due to begin within months on the structure of a new, and probably more federal, system of government, says our correspondent. But there are still concerns that peace with the groups signing Thursday's agreement could be short lived, if the Burmese army ignores the ceasefire, as it has with others. Earlier this week, all of the groups signing were removed from the government's list of "unlawful associations", a step towards bringing them into mainstream politics. Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has previously urged rebel groups to focus more on a lasting deal than a quick one, was not at the signing ceremony. Representatives from the United Nations, the European Union, India and China and others witnessed the signing.	Myanmar has signed a ceasefire deal with eight armed rebel groups, in the hope of ending decades of conflict.
They say the arrests happened when protesters refused to leave land owned by the pipeline company. A spokesman said the latest arrests brought the number detained since August to almost 700. They came after the US Army was ordered to allow the construction of the final section of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Native Americans and their supporters have protested against the project for months, and have vowed to fight on. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe say the final section - under Lake Oahe, a reservoir on the Missouri River - would contaminate drinking water on their land and damage sacred burial sites. Morton County Sheriff's Office spokesman Rob Keller said the latest arrests were made after demonstrators moved from their existing camp on flood-prone ground to land owned by the pipeline company, Energy Transfer Partners. He said no injuries had been reported during the operation. Protest leaders could not be reached for comment. The $3.7bn (Â£2.8bn) pipeline is designed to transport about 470,000 barrels of crude oil a day across four states, from North Dakota to a terminal in Illinois, where it can be shipped to refineries. The US Army Corps of Engineers, which has approval authority, decided last year to explore other routes for the pipeline amid huge protests by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. But earlier this week, acting Secretary of the Army Robert Speer ordered the corps to allow the work to go ahead. President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order signalling his support for the pipeline.	Police in the US state of North Dakota say they have arrested 76 people protesting against a controversial oil pipeline.
Sandra Bland was arrested during a heated traffic stop captured on film. She was found dead three days later. The 28-year-old's death and the video footage of her arrest sparked outrage. The arresting officer, Brian Encinia, has been charged with allegedly lying about it, a prosecutor announced after a day of grand jury discussions. Hours later, he was fired from his job. The grand jury had picked out the officer's affidavit as behind their decision, said special prosecutor Shawn McDonald. In that affidavit, Mr Encinia had claimed that Ms Bland was "combative and uncooperative" after he pulled her over. The argument began after she was asked to put out her cigarette and he demanded she get out of her car. Video footage showed the police officer drawing his stun gun and threatening Ms Bland with the words: "I will light you up!" After the argument moved off-camera, she was heard screaming that he was about to break her wrists and she complained that her head knocked against the ground. Mr McDonald said grand jurors found Mr Encinia's statement that he had "removed her from her vehicle to further conduct a safer traffic investigation" to be false. Soon after the indictment, the Texas Department of Public Safety said "termination proceedings" would start immediately. Ms Bland's death three days after her arrest was ruled a suicide and the sheriff's officials and jailers were cleared of any crime. But it sparked national headlines for days amid a debate about the police use of force against African Americans. The perjury charge carries a maximum sentence of one year in jail and a $4,000 fine.	A Texas police officer has been charged with perjury over his confrontation with a woman who died in jail shortly after being arrested.
Judge Aaron Persky has been heavily criticised for giving student Brock Turner six months for assaulting an unconscious woman last year. Two other petitions have reached 115,000 and 175,000 signatures each. The petitions have no legal force but organisers hope they will increase pressure on politicians to act. Mr Persky, a Superior Court judge in Santa Clara County, California, has reportedly received death threats in the wake of the case. The jail sentence he handed down to Turner has been widely criticised as too lenient. Prosecutors had called for six years. Turner was seen by two other students sexually assaulting his victim, now 23, behind an outdoor rubbish bin. He tried to flee the scene but was caught and later admitted to the assault in court. Rights activists and members of the general public have accused Mr Persky of being influenced by Turner's upbringing in a wealthy, white family, and his achievements as a college swimmer. The petition, posted on Change.org, says that Mr Persky had "failed to send the message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class, race, gender or other factors". The judge said in his remarks that he was concerned about the "severe impact" a longer sentence would have on Turner's life. Turner's father was also criticised after issuing a statement to the court saying his son was paying a steep price for only "20 minutes of action". Turner, who was a promising swimmer expected to compete for the US at Olympic level, has been banned for life by USA Swimming, the governing body for professional swimming in the US. The victim, who has not been named by the press, read an impact statement in court which was later read by millions. US Vice-President Joe Biden, who is involved in a campaign against campus assaults, wrote her an open letter praising her for her courage and saying he was "filled with furious anger" at the course of events. The cast of the TV show Girls have also made a video backing the woman and other victims of sexual assault.	More than a million people have signed a petition calling for the judge in the controversial Stanford University sexual assault case to be sacked.
Dressed in a suit, he handed out currencies in exchange for sterling to customers at the Asda in Trafford Park, police said. He then emptied the safe into a bag before walking out of the store at 15:45 BST on 29 July. Police said they were still searching for the man, described as in his mid 20s or 30s, Asian and of slim build. A 22-year-old woman has been arrested and bailed on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud.	A man has walked away with £40,000 from a superstore in Manchester after posing as a manager at the Bureau de Change.
The operation foiled a plan to smuggle drugs and weapons from South America to the port of Gioia Tauro in Calabria, officials said. The raids targeted two mafia crime families, the Gambino of New York and the Ndrangheta from Calabria. FBI agents travelled to Italy to take part in the raids. Police said the two-year investigation prevented the delivery to Italy of hundreds of kilograms of cocaine hidden in coconuts and pineapples, as well as heroin and marijuana. Gioia Tauro, the intended destination of the drugs, is one of Europe's largest shipping ports. Eight of the arrests were made in New York, and are linked with the Gambino crime family which is believed to have negotiated the deal. The other 18 people were arrested in Italy are believed to have been involved with the Ndrangheta clan.	Police in the US and Italy say they have arrested 26 people in a joint raid against a new mafia-operated drug trafficking route.
When the nozzle releasing a stream of molten glass is raised above a certain level, that thread begins to wobble. It traces out waves or loops - which the team found could be controlled by adjusting the speed of the nozzle. Those shapes then become the building blocks for intricate, 3D objects. Engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology pioneered a method for glass 3D printing in 2015. They then started to work with mathematician Pierre-Thomas Brun, who has studied the fluid dynamics of liquid "ropes". The results are documented in a video, which the team presented in the American Physical Society's "Gallery of Fluid Motion" in November. It all started with a collaboration between two labs at MIT, Dr Brun told the BBC - one specialising in glass and the other in "mediated matter". Runny honey "Normally when you 3D print, the nozzle is very close to the piece that you're printing - that's the conventional method. But what they started working with was having a large offset. "And in that case, instead of having a thread that falls down and moves straight, you can create coil-like patterns like honey on toast." That coiling process, as it happens, is exactly what Dr Brun studied during his PhD. "I came up with a reduced model that explained the dynamics of these things," he said. "So I have a way to rationalise the patterns they observed, and we started working together in order to create some structures that take those patterns as building blocks." Suddenly, instead of being a potential flaw in the system, the wobbling of the liquid glass became a tunable design feature. And what is more, some of the tiny loops are smaller than anything that could be created by moving the nozzle itself around. The physics of the dribbling glass itself was now a precision instrument. What most impressed Dr Brun was how simple it was to control that instrument. For a given nozzle height, he explained, everything boils down to how fast the glass is being poured, relative to how fast the nozzle is moving forward. "These coils may seem complex, but you can rationalise them in a very simple way. And to do that you need one number: how fast is the glass falling onto the surface?" If the dribbling of the glass starts to outstrip the forward progress of the nozzle, the thread will trace out a meandering, wavy line instead of a straight one. Then if the forward motion gets even slower, the glass will start to trace small, alternating loops. Even slower, and the loops become one big coil. It was a surprise, Dr Brun said, that this simple ratio produced such a variety of shapes. "This is a very complex system, but you can forget about all the other properties. That's a big statement, which has no reason to be true - but it is, in this case." Following the lead of other researchers, studying the dynamics of viscous liquid threads nearly 10 years ago, Dr Brun and his colleagues called their system a "sewing machine". "It does exactly what a sewing machine does," he observed. "You go from a thread, to patterns which are tied to each other like stitching patterns - but this time they're made out of glass." Many of his collaborators at MIT are interested in potential applications for architecture, and the design may also prove useful in sculpture and in 3D printing - or "additive manufacturing" - more widely. "There are many possibilities, but for now this is just a proof of concept," Dr Brun said. Follow Jonathan on Twitter	US researchers have developed what they call a "molten glass sewing machine" by combining 3D printing of glass with a mathematical model of how a liquid thread forms different types of loop.
The 23-year-old made 116 as Tim Groenewald and Lewis Gregory rattled through the rest of the hosts line-up. Jennings, who hit 15 fours, finally fell top-edging Josh Davey to gully before Durham were bowled out for 256. Tom Abell and Davey fell lbw to Rushworth, then Onions bowled Marcus Trescothick as Somerset closed on 30-3. Durham batsmen Mark Stoneman and Scott Borthwick both fell cheaply as Somerset started brightly before Jack Burnham (33) helped repair the innings in a 79-run third-wicket partnership with Jennings. Burnham eventually fell when he was bowled by Davey. Gregory then claimed two wicket in two balls, including uprooting Paul Collingwood's middle stump first ball, as Somerset looked to gain some momentum. Rushworth became Gregory's fourth victim of the day, departing to an exceptional slip catch from Jim Allenby it left the visitors with 12 overs to face. And last year's Division One leading wicket-taker struck in his fourth when Abell was trapped playing across the line before nightwatchman Davey was caught out in the next over when the ball nipped back. Onions' inswinging yorker then dismissed the Somerset captain as the away side limped to the close, trailing by 226 runs.	Keaton Jennings' century and three quick wickets from opening pair Chris Rushworth and Graham Onions gave Durham the edge against Somerset on day one.
Footage showed the workers rescued through a hole cut in one of the glass windows of One World Trade Center. The Fire Department of New York earlier told the BBC the two people were uninjured and tethered. The call came in at 12:42 EST (17:42 GMT) and firefighters were on the scene in less than four minutes, it said. The window cleaners were pulled inside at around 14:15 EST. The rescued men were identified as Juan Lopez, who has been a window cleaner for five years, and Juan Lizama, who has been on the job for 14 years, Gerard McEneaney, a labour union official, told Reuters. The 1,776ft (541m) tower opened for business last week as the first of 3,000 employees of publishing giant Conde Nast moved into their new offices there. A police official said the partially collapsed cradle was hanging at "a 75-degree angle". The cable on the cradle apparently broke as it retracted towards the roof of the building. People on the ground were moved back in case glass fell from One World Trade Center, the country's tallest skyscraper. Gary Hansen, an architect who worked on the building, happened to be across the street during the incident. Mr Hansen told Reuters the building was designed with three cranes on top, two to suspend platforms and one for emergencies. "These are the kind of emergencies architects plan for," he said.	New York firefighters have rescued two window cleaners who were trapped on a collapsed cradle 69 storeys above the ground at the World Trade Center site.
Entries for all candidates in England, Northern Ireland and Wales are down 0.7% on last year to 5,240,796, according to official figures. By contrast, in England the overall entry for GCSEs in England increased slightly from 4,916,000 in 2015 to 4,929,000 this year. Early entries (for students in Year 10 or below) fell for the second year running in England to 300,000 - a 13% drop on 2015. This follows a 32% fall from 504,000 in 2014 to 344,000 in 2015 and reflects government moves to discourage schools from entering pupils early. But more older students were entered this year, reflecting the raising of the participation age in education to 17 in 2013 and then to 18 last year. The government is also encouraging older pupils to resit English and maths if they do not achieve good grades (A* to C) in Year 11 This year there were 355,000 GCSE entries for post-Year 11 students, up 26% on last year's figure of 282,000. By subject, Ofqual noted 2016 increases for Year 11 students in English literature, biology, chemistry, physics, geography, history, science, additional science Spanish and computing. But entries fell in English and English language, German and French. In England this year's GCSEs will be the last to be marked under the existing system, graded A* to G. Last September new "more demanding" courses were introduced in English and maths for the current Year 10 - but this change will not have any affect on this year's results as the new courses are linear and will be examined next summer at the end of two years. In England students who started GCSE courses last September in maths, English and English literature will be graded 1-9 in these subjects when they get their results in summer 2017. The new grades will come in for most other GCSEs the following year. These include biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, languages, religious education, geography, music and history, which will be taught from September 2016, with exams in 2018. A third wave of 1-9 graded GCSEs will be taught from September 2017 with exams in 2019. These include psychology, ancient history, business, information and communications technology (ICT) and media studies. Ofqual has also said that it expects broadly the same proportion of students who currently received a grade C and above under the current system to achieve a grade 4 and above under the new system. The new courses will include far less coursework, with grades in almost all subjects depending on exams. These courses are designed to be more rigorous with exams taken after two years of study rather than in modules with exams along the way. Foundation and higher-tier papers for students in different ability ranges will be phased out. A GCSE reform programme is also under way in Wales with new courses from the WJEC board taught in Welsh schools from last September in six key subjects. These are English language, Welsh language, English literature, Welsh literature, mathematics and numeracy and mathematics. The November 2017 and summer 2017 exams will reflect these new qualifications and the results will no longer be comparable with their equivalents in England, says the Welsh government. Northern Ireland is also developing new GCSE specifications for first teaching from September 2017 and will retain A*-G grades rather than adopt England's new numeric grading system. Some schools offer courses from English exam boards alongside those from the Northern Ireland board, CCEA. You may get your results by text, email or in the post, but it's still a good idea to go to your school or college on results day. By doing this, you can get help and advice from your teachers. If you live in England, yes. This summer's GCSE cohort in England (born between 1 September 1999 and 31 August 2000) is the second to have to stay in education or employment with training until 18. In Scotland, if you turn 16 between 1 March and 30 September, you can leave school after 31 May of that year. If you turn 16 between 1 October and the end of February, you can leave at the start of the Christmas holidays in that school year. In Wales, you can leave school on the last Friday in June, as long as you will be 16 by the end of that school year's summer holidays. In Northern Ireland, if you turn 16 during the school year (between 1 September and 1 July), you can leave school after 30 June. If you turn 16 between 2 July and 31 August, you cannot leave school until 30 June the following year. Try not to panic. If you don't get the grades asked for by the sixth-form or college of your choice, approach the staff there and see if they are prepared to be flexible. It's possible they will still give you a place or they might be prepared to take you on for different courses. Alternatively, approach other schools or colleges - you might find they will accept you. Resits will be complicated by the course changes, with the current set of GCSEs in English and maths being phased out. Ofqual has required the boards to offer resits in the current English, English and maths exams in November and next summer and in science subjects no later than summer 2018. For other current GCSE courses, boards will also be allowed to offer a single resit opportunity in the year following the last scheduled sitting. Students will have to resit all the exams for the qualification and there is an expectation that candidates will be at least 16. If you feel strongly that your grades are wrong and do not reflect your ability, you can ask for a re-mark of your papers. Requests for re-marking can only be done through your school or college. Make sure someone there is dealing with the matter. There is a fee for this service, which is reimbursed only if there is a grade change. The Joint Council for Qualifications has guidelines on the post-results service available to schools. You can call the national exam results helpline on 0808 100 8000 or the National Careers Service on 0800 100 900.	Pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are receiving their GCSE results - just over two weeks after teenagers in Scotland received the results of their equivalent National 4s and 5s.
The 33-year-old goalkeeper was busy in a 3-3 draw, his first taste of the Champions League group stage. Having been the number one choice for the past two seasons, Gordon was playing after Dorus de Vries picked up an injury at the weekend. "I was happy with how I played - that's all I can do," he said. "Everybody wants to be a part of nights like that. There is no bigger incentive to play well and keep your place." Former Hearts and Sunderland keeper Gordon started the first nine matches of the season but lost his place to summer recruit De Vries in mid-August. Gordon was a half-time replacement in Saturday's win over Kilmarnock, with the 35-year-old Dutchman suffering a chest injury. De Vries was fit enough to be among the substitutes in a thriller with Manchester City in which Gordon made two good stops to deny Ilkay Gundogan, one late in the game from a deflected strike. "This is the highest level of club football and to finally manage that at the age of 33 is a special moment for me," said Gordon. "We'd have liked to get the three points but it was an incredible effort against a top quality side." Asked how the match ranked in his long career, he replied: "It's right up there. The atmosphere was just incredible. "The noise was unbelievable. There was a couple of times when I was absolutely screaming at Kolo [Toure] to leave the ball and he just couldn't hear me. I couldn't have shouted any louder." Gordon, capped 44 times for Scotland, insists his self-belief has not wavered since dropping to the bench and is hoping manager Brendan Rodgers will find it difficult to reinstate De Vries. "I've always been confident in what I'm able to do," he added. "It was other people saying my confidence was gone. "If I've not been selected, that's the manager's decision and I fully respect that. "The other side of that is that I want to play every game. "I think I've done pretty well in stages this season and if I can get a run in the team then hopefully I can go from strength to strength."	Craig Gordon hopes an impressive display against Manchester City can help him retain a regular starting position at Celtic.
All 108 MLAs met to sign the roll of membership, with 29 newly-elected members doing so for the first time. The Ulster Unionists announced they will form an opposition. UUP leader Mike Nesbitt said "let battle commence". Mr Nesbitt, said the first and deputy first minister would not have the support of his party at the executive table, as the "Ulster Unionist MLA group have unanimously decided to form the first official opposition of this Northern Ireland Assembly". He said: "This is a big and bold move to bring a better and a more normal democracy to the people of Northern Ireland - let battle commence!". Mr McGuinness said Mr Nesbitt's move was "deeply disappointing" and a "huge mistake". "It will be seen as a lack of leadership," he added. SDLP (Social Democratic and Labour Party) leader Colum Eastwood said they have some work to do before making any decisions. Alliance party leader David Ford congratulated Mr Nesbitt on the "sound bite of the day". "Some of us recognise that government is a bit more substantial than the sound bite of the day" he said. The DUP's Robin Newton has been elected as the new speaker, replacing Mitchel McLaughlin, who announced his retirement before the election. Mr Newton said he wants to "uphold the standards that his predecessors have set". "The people of Northern Ireland are looking to us," he added. "I want to prove to them that we are moving forward." Sinn Féin's Caitríona Ruane, the SDLP's Patsy McGlone and the UUP's Danny Kennedy have been elected as deputy speakers. Ms Ruane has been elected as the principal deputy speaker. People Before Profit Alliance MLAs Eamonn McCann and Gerry Carroll were among the newly-elected members signing the roll. Mr Carroll revealed via social media that when they were asked to designate as "unionist, nationalist or other", he and Mr McCann wrote "socialist". "We will be put in the 'other' camp, but we are clear where we stand," he said. "This isn't the Alliance Party. This is the new socialist alternative." MLAs also undertook to support the rule of law, challenge paramilitary activity and accept no authority but a democratic mandate. Live coverage of proceedings at the new NI assembly The full Northern Ireland Executive will be formed when a programme for government has been agreed. The parties, who were given an outline of a framework for government programme on Tuesday, have until Thursday to make a response. Negotiations on the framework could go on for two weeks. In last week's election, the Democratic Unionist Party maintained the 38 seats it held in the last assembly, while Sinn Féin lost one and now holds 28. The Ulster Unionists have 16 seats, while the Social Democratic and Labour Party lost two and now have 12. The Alliance Party secured eight seats during the election, meaning it does not have enough seats to automatically qualify for a ministerial department.	The DUP's Arlene Foster has been reappointed as Northern Ireland first minister and Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness as deputy first minister, with the UUP announcing they will form an opposition at the Stormont assembly.
Winners of the cup competition earn a place in the Europa League. Four-time cup winners Forest have failed to progress past the third round for the past 11 seasons and start their campaign at Doncaster on Tuesday. "It's very important because it is the only way to go into the Europa League," Montanier told BBC Radio Nottingham. "I know it's difficult because there are a lot of teams from the Premier League and Championship. It will be a very important game." Forest, two-time European Cup winners under Brian Clough in 1979 and 1980, who also guided the club to its four League Cup titles, last featured in European competition in the 1995-96 season, reaching the Uefa Cup quarter-finals. The Reds, who last won the League Cup in 1990 and featured in the final in 1992, were knocked out of the competition by League One side Walsall 12 months ago. Their trip to face League Two side Doncaster comes three days after Montanier oversaw Forest's Championship season opening victory against Burton Albion, in what was his first competitive match in English football. Former Rennes boss Montanier also confirmed that the injury to goalkeeper Dorus de Vries, suffered in the 4-3 victory over Burton on Saturday, is not as bad as first feared. "It will be a few weeks, but not serious," Montanier said.	Nottingham Forest manager Philippe Montanier says he wants to guide the Championship side into Europe next season as EFL Cup holders.
Investigations are continuing into why the vehicle ploughed into Catherine Bonner's flat in Main Road, Fairlie, at about 13:45 on Thursday. The A78 through the village is expected to remain closed until early next week. A 55-year-old man who also lived in the flats continues to be treated for minor injuries at Inverclyde Royal Hospital. He and the driver were rescued by the emergency services from the rubble. The 54-year-old driver has been released after treatment. The lorry has been removed from the building and has been taken away to undergo further tests that will help establish the cause of the crash. North Ayrshire Council said it was working with contractors and engineers to ensure that the properties affected "are made safe". "Engineers and contractors have started work to secure the affected buildings and it is expected that a partial demolition may be required to ensure the site is made safe," the council said in a statement. "The council has agreed that contractors can work into and through the night, if necessary. "It is hoped that this will allow the A78 to re-open early next week." The council said it had arranged for letters to be delivered to all 600 households in Fairlie informing them of the situation and making them aware that some noise disturbance is likely through the night while work is ongoing. The statement added: "The council has apologised in advance for any disturbance which may be caused." Fairlie Community Council has been campaigning for road improvements in the area. It has argued that the route is not suitable for traffic that includes lorries heading to Hunterston power station. Councillor John Ferguson, North Ayrshire Council's cabinet member for infrastructure, said: "While responsibility for management of the A78 trunk road lies with Transport Scotland, the council has lobbied - and will continue to lobby - for improvements to the road. "A draft version of the North Ayrshire Local Plan, published in 2003, called on the (then) Scottish Executive to 'fully assess the need for further improvements on the trunk road network and bring forward schemes at the earliest possible date for the A78 coastal route'. "While the specific reference to a Fairlie by-pass was removed at the request of the Scottish Executive's reporter, the council's aspiration for improvement schemes along the A78 coastal route remains."	Work will continue through the night to make safe the site of a house struck by a lorry in an accident that led to the death of a 55-year-old woman.
They face a monumental task. The death toll is uncertain - it teeters around the 6,000 mark. For emergency staff though it is the living, trapped in remote areas, whom they are desperate to reach. Many have broken bones. Some face the threat of crush syndrome - where the kidneys start to fail. But the Nepalese health system was stretched even before the quake. The charity Save the Children says it is now at breaking point. Most people live in remote areas that can be difficult to access even when natural disasters do not stand in the way. Some of the most critical needs now are obvious - surgeons are arriving to fix broken bones, injured spines and head trauma. And Save the Children medical teams are hearing reports that thousands need operations. Another charity in the area, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has deployed an inflatable hospital so treatment can be given in otherwise inaccessible places. But some are concerned that people who have been trapped under rubble remain at risk of crush syndrome. This is when the body releases toxins in response to massive and sustained injuries- and these can overwhelm the kidneys as they try to flush them out. Dialysis - artificial kidney machines - can help. But according to MSF, Kathmandu's main hospital only has eight. Such life-saving equipment only counts if people can be transferred to safety. At the moment though, there is an urgency for more basic needs -  shelter, safe water, sanitation and food. At least 2.8 million people have been displaced - either because their houses have been destroyed or because they are too afraid of aftershocks to remain at home. And without safe ways to dispose of waste, drinking water is in danger of being contaminated by fatal bugs. In some places, public toilets are overflowing. The World Health Organization (WHO) is on alert for any outbreaks of diarrhoeal diseases including infections such as cholera. According to their experts, there have been some sporadic cases of diarrhoeal illness reported in makeshift camps. Though things aren't near outbreak proportions, the coming rainy season could make things worse. Dr Prince Mathew, from MSF, said: "With the monsoon season approaching, we're worried that the window of opportunity to reach people in these areas is rapidly closing." Katrin Kisswani, medical co-ordinator for MSF arrived in Kathmandu two days after the quake hit. She told the BBC: "The most difficult thing is to reach the people most at need. "We have managed to start mobile clinics using helicopters to get to remote villages in the mountains. But many roads are still blocked by landslides." Some survivors have managed to reach the capital. Ms Kisswani added: "They are very, very shocked and traumatised. "Many have lost their livelihoods, their relatives and sometimes almost entire villages are gone." Psychological help is also required urgently, she said. While many people will see images of the destruction and naturally want to help, the World Health Organization cautions they should think carefully and ensure they are not a burden on local efforts. Dr Ian Norton said: "There are small teams that have been launched after watching the news and that are trying to respond with the best of intentions, but unfortunately they do not have the sustainability to be able to deploy into the remote areas where we need them the most."	A week after the earthquake hit, scores of rescue workers are still flying in to Nepal.
New rules come in on 1 January, which will reduce compensation to £75,000 per person, per institution. Previously the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) protected savings of up to £85,000 per account. Joint accounts will see protection cut from £170,000 to £150,000. The maximum compensation across the European Union is set at €100,000, and the British level was reduced as a result of the pound gaining strength against the euro. The precise rate was set on 3 July 2015. At the time, one senior Tory MP described the change as "defective". Although 95% of savers will still be protected, as many as 2.5 million people may not be, according to the FSCS. It is advising savers who have more than £75,000 in one account, or in one institution, to move their money if necessary. The situation is further complicated by the fact that some registered banks and building societies operate under more than one brand. So it you had £75,000 savings with HSBC, for example, any additional savings in First Direct would not be protected, as both banks have a joint licence. Savers using Bank of Scotland and Halifax are in the same position. But Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and NatWest - although they are sister banks - are both registered separately. So savers could safely have up to £75,000 in accounts with both banks. "While this should be quite simple to navigate, it's made complicated by the fact that FSCS cover is shared between banks that operate under the same licence," said Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) publishes a full list of registered banks, and which brands come under the same umbrella. Under the new rules, savers who have up to £1m in their accounts temporarily - as a result of selling a house, or being made redundant, for example - are also protected. To receive compensation, they cannot have had that cash in their accounts for more than six months. A further warning comes in relation to some foreign banks which trade in the UK, but are registered within the eurozone, such as Germany's Fidor Bank, or Sweden's Handelsbanken. Handelsbanken confirmed that the level of compensation would depend on the exchange rate at the time. So depending on how much €100,000 is worth in pounds, savers may get more or less than £75,000 protection. At the time of writing, that amount is worth less than £74,000. "With an increasing number of European banks now offering competitive rates, customers need to be aware that not all savings accounts offered in the UK are covered by the UK compensation scheme," said Rachel Thrussell, savings insight manager at Moneyfacts.co.uk.	Millions of savers are being reminded that they may need to move some of their cash, to guarantee it will be fully protected in the event of their bank going bust.
Lee Waters said Neil McEvoy had suggested a "great party political conspiracy theory" was behind various matters the Public Accounts Committee had investigated. Mr Waters warned against the committee becoming a "circus". Mr McEvoy said he was "not surprised" Mr Waters "wants to brush the failures of his government under the carpet." Speaking in a Senedd debate about the committee's work, Mr McEvoy suggested former economy minister Edwina Hart or the first minister should be called to give evidence on several issues the committee had looked at. They included the Welsh Government's financial support for failed companies, its sale at a loss of two shops in Pontypridd and the RIFW land deals. "We need to get serious about ending financial waste in Wales, and I think the public accounts committee is the perfect place to do that," said Mr McEvoy . "I'd ask the chair if he would accept my call to put to the committee the suggestion of a forensic investigation into all these matters, because Labour incompetence is endangering devolution, and we have to shed light on these matters and bring transparency." Mr Waters responded: "It's imperative it [the public accounts committee] doesn't become a circus. "I have no problem following any evidence and in holding governments to account with rigour but that requires all members to take the committee seriously, to engage in its work, read the voluminous papers in advance, to engage with the evidence. "Not to spend the whole committee meeting tapping away at their iPhones then lobbing in some partisan-fuelled conspiracy theory, because that I think brings the committee into disrepute." Mr Waters said that "when there is evidence we must follow it" and "we should be ruthless in pursuing it". Following the debate, Mr McEvoy told BBC Wales: "I'm not surprised that Lee wants to brush the failures of his government under the carpet because he's a Labour AM. "It's becoming a consistent theme now that when I challenge Labour on the issues their AMs resort to smears and personal attacks. "I've highlighted Â£53m that the taxpayer has lost thanks to Labour incompetence - this isn't some conspiracy theory."	A Labour assembly member has accused a Plaid Cymru committee colleague of being a conspiracy theorist.
Traditionally it's always been much less good at keeping secrets. Journalists have a natural inclination toward gossip. So, it was highly unusual that BBC bosses had managed to keep the launch of a whole new BBC Scotland channel entirely secret until it was announced to staff on Wednesday morning. Staff, viewers and politicians were expecting to be told that plans for a "Scottish Six" had been shelved. No one knew that there would be an hour-long news programme with Scottish, UK and world news at 9pm instead. Already there has been a widespread welcome for the idea of a new channel, new programmes and most importantly new money to make those programmes. The announcement of new nightly news programme at 9pm does mean that the idea of a "Scottish Six" is now dead. So people who had been campaigning for that will be frustrated. Already the First Minster Nicola Sturgeon has said there is lots to welcome in this announcement but that it doesn't deliver everything she wanted. Saying it's disappointing that there is no Scottish Six - but "progress and hopefully sign of new thinking". Another SNP politician told me that the decision not to put a Scottish news hour on BBC One looks "entirely political". Saying that viewers accustomed to getting their news at tea time may not immediately develop the habit of watching a digital channel at 9pm. But for those who wanted a news programme reflecting the world from a Scottish perspective, produced and presented from Scotland - the BBC is now delivering what they asked for. The Scottish Six is dead. Long live the Scottish Nine.	The BBC is very experienced at broadcasting news to as many people as possible.
Michael Patterson was handed the order after being convicted of break-ins in the Levenshulme and Longsight areas of the city. His "consistent method" was to carry out burglaries after entering rear alleyways, magistrates heard. The 49-year-old, of Field Bank Grove, Gorton admitted three counts of burglary and possession of a Class B drug and was jailed for 16 months. The ban, known as a criminal behaviour order, will run indefinitely after his release. It will ban Patterson from entering rear alleyways with the exception of the one behind his own home. The order also prohibits him from entering an area of Stockport Road, from Stanley Grove in Longsight up to Albert Road in Levenshulme, and the surrounding streets. Premises targeted in the break-ins included a takeaway, a solicitors' office and a mobile phone shop. Nigel Murphy, Manchester City Council's executive member for neighbourhood services, said: "Michael Patterson has used the same technique repeatedly to commit a number of offences and this order will prevent him continuing the pattern."	A prolific burglar has been banned from all of Manchester's back alleyways.

The search was launched after the coastguard received reports from an individual claiming to be in difficulty off the coast of County Down. Two RNLI boats and a coastguard helicopter from Scotland were launched to assist in the search. The kayaker was reported to be near Mew Island, one of the Copeland Islands near Donaghadee. A coastguard spokesman said it received several calls from a person claiming to be in difficulty. However, the alarm was declared to be a hoax following a thorough search.	The coastguard has called off a search for a kayaker after it declared the alarm an "elaborate hoax".
In a report, the agency says the past decade in Europe has been the warmest on record. It adds that the cost of damage caused by extreme weather events is rising, and the continent is set to become more vulnerable in the future. The findings have been published ahead of next week's UN climate conference. They join a UN Environment Programme report also released on Wednesday showing dangerous growth in the "emissions gap" - the difference between current carbon emission levels and those needed to avert climate change. "Every indicator we have in terms of giving us an early warning of climate change and increasing vulnerability is giving us a very strong signal," observed EEA executive director Jacqueline McGlade. "It is across the board, it is not just global temperatures," she told BBC News. "It is in human health aspects, in forests, sea levels, agriculture, biodiversity - the signals are coming in from right across the environment." 2C or not 2C The report - Climate Change, Impacts and Vulnerabilities in Europe 2012 - involving more than 50 authors from a range of organisations, listed a number of "key messages", including: As it currently stands, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change has set a target of limiting the rise in global mean temperature to 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial levels. But the report's authors warn that even if this target to mitigate warming is met, "substantial impacts on society, human health and ecosystems are projected to occur". To limit the impacts, experts say effective adaptation strategies need to be developed in order to minimise the risk to nations' infrastructure, homes and businesses. The European Commission is expected to publish its European Adaptation Strategy in 2013, outlining measures it think will help the 27-nation bloc deal with future climate shifts. Examples of adaptation measures include using water resources more efficiently, adapting building codes to be able to withstand extreme weather events and building flood defences. Prof McGlade said such measures would be essential in order to climate-proof the EU. "I think what the European Commission and other parts of the world are finding is that whilst it is important to understand what is happening at the global level, it is what is happening at the regional and local levels that will really determine how economies will weather the storm," she said. The report said the cost of damage caused by extreme weather events had increased from 9bn euros (Â£7bn) in the 1980s to 13bn euros in the 2000s. One of the report's authors, Andre Jol, head of the EEA's vulnerability and adaptation group, added: "We know that the main increase in damage costs from natural disasters has not been from climate change, as such, but more as a result of an increase in wealth, people and infrastructure in risk areas. "But one of the key messages from the report is that in the future, with projected increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme events, we know that climate change will contribute to the increase in the cost of damage from extreme events." 'Lack of action' On Monday, the World Bank published a report that warned that the world was "on track to a 4C [increase by the end of the century] marked by extreme heatwaves and life-threatening sea-level rise". It added that the world's poorest regions would be hardest hit by the warming, which was "likely to undermine efforts and goals". "A 4C warmer world can, and must be, avoided - we need to hold warming below 2C," said World Bank group president Jim Yong Kim. "Lack of action on climate change threatens to make the world our children inherit a completely different world than we are living in today." However, the UN Environment Programme (Unep) warned that it was still possible to achieve the 2C target but time was running out. Data in the Emissions Gap Report showed that annual greenhouse gas emissions were now "14% above where they need to be in 2020". Unep executive director Achim Steiner said: "While governments work to negotiate a new international climate agreement to come into effect in 2020, they urgently need to put their foot firmly on the action pedal by fulfilling financial, technology transfer and other commitments under the UN climate convention treaties." The reports have been published ahead of the annual two-week UN climate conference, which starts on Monday in Doha, Qatar.	The effects of climate change are already evident in Europe and the situation is set to get worse, the European Environment Agency has warned.
Police said the accident happened at just before 13:00 at the event in Blaxhall, north-east of Ipswich. The air ambulance service attended and the man was pronounced dead at the scene, a police spokeswoman said. She said there were "not believed to be any suspicious circumstances" surrounding the incident and a file would be prepared for the coroner. Club secretary Lyn Berwick from Woodbridge DMCC, which is based at the Blaxhall track, confirmed it was not one of their riders who had died, but said the man had been competing at the purpose-built circuit. At the time it was hosting the penultimate round of Eastern Centre Championship, with riders from across East Anglia. She said members of the club were with the deceased's family but declined to comment any further.	A man in his 20s has died after falling from his bike at a motocross event in Suffolk.
Daniel Jones, 58, who has admitted his involvement in the heist, offered to take police to the stashed loot. Jewels, gold and gems were buried in Edmonton Cemetery in north London. Three men deny conspiracy to commit burglary. A fourth denies conspiracy to conceal or transfer criminal property. Police searched the area and found two bags, one containing jewellery and another precious stones, at a memorial site for Sidney James Hart, the grandfather of Jones' children. Jones was then taken from prison and led the officers to another relation's memorial, where a smaller stash of gold, jewellery and gems were hidden. Prosecutor Philip Evans told Woolwich Crown Court: "He was hoping if he gave up the smaller quantity at plot GB177 he would still have access to the larger stash of criminal property, no doubt for his future use." Jones told police he was the only person who knew of the stash and declared "there's no other outstanding property. That is all I had", the court heard. Jurors were told earlier how the mastermind behind the Hatton Garden raid pulled out of the heist after failing to complete the task in one night. Brian Reader, 76, dubbed the "Master" by co-conspirators, withdrew from the raid when the gang struggled to get into the vault in one night. Up to £14m was looted from 73 safety deposit boxes in London's jewellery quarter two days later on 4 April. The gang drilled into the secure premises on 2 April but discovered the vault was blocked off by a metal cabinet, bolted to the floor on the other side, Woolwich Crown Court heard. The men returned with different equipment two nights later to finish the job, but Reader was not with them when they made off with the loot, which was later hidden in two wheelie bins and stashed in holdalls. Defendants and charges Previously John Collins, 75, of Bletsoe Walk, Islington; Daniel Jones, 58, of Park Avenue, Enfield; Terry Perkins, 67, of Heene Road, Enfield and Brian Reader, 76, of Dartford Road, Dartford, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary. They will be sentenced at a later date. The court heard after the raid -  the "largest burglary in English legal history" - the gang stored the loot in two wheelie bins and some holdalls. Some was also hidden behind skirting boards and inside kitchen cupboards in their own homes. The plan was to convert the stolen goods into money, but initially they divided the proceeds between them, with the intention of keeping it hidden until publicity surrounding the heist died down, it was said. "When they were confident that had happened, they could split it up, melt it down, sell it or hide for a rainy day," Mr Evans said. Jurors heard part of the bounty was sold for sizeable sums of money. Officers swooped during one of the loot transfers to Mr Harbinson on 19 May. In the days before, police recording devices picked up Perkins boasting about the historic feat, saying: "And what a book you could write." He also described how some of the stolen "Indian" gold would fund his pension. The trial continues.	One of the Hatton Garden raiders buried his share of the £14m stash under two family graves, but tried to dupe police by just revealing one, a court has heard.
The West Indian Carnival in Leeds was launched in 1967 and once again will take over Potternewton Park for the August bank holiday weekend. An exhibition recording its heritage, political and cultural legacy is planned for the city's Tetley gallery. There will also be a week of new plays commemorating carnival at West Yorkshire Playhouse. Live updates and more from Yorkshire Additionally, it has been announced that an illuminated night carnival will kick-off the annual arts and light festival Light Night in October. A recreation of the Sun Goddess, the first Leeds Carnival Queen costume, will be featured at the exhibition from August to October. The celebration of food, music and culture will culminate again in a parade through Chapeltown and Harehills. An estimated 160,000 revellers attended last year's carnival, organisers said. Arthur France initiated it after becoming homesick for his native St Kitts and Nevis. Mr France, head of the organising committee, said: "When you come to carnival it is electric, so many things going on, beautiful costumes, beautiful colours, beautiful music." However, attempts to bring the parade into the city centre have been shelved. Mr France said he was "very sad and upset" at the council decision but added that it would not "dampen my spirits". Councillor Judith Blake, leader of Leeds City Council, said: "A lot of events are happening on the bank holiday weekend and with the advice it just wouldn't be possible." Ms Blake added: "The oldest carnival in Europe is here in Leeds. We are so keen to make sure as a city we come together and everyone celebrates an incredible achievement." She praised Mr France as a "legend" that had made "an absolutely fantastic contribution heading up a brilliant team of people".	Plans have been announced for the "oldest carnival in Europe" to celebrate its 50th anniversary.
Naming rights are among the powers set to be devolved in the Wales Bill now going through the UK Parliament. But Jane Hutt, Labour's chief whip in the assembly, will call for the Welsh Parliament name to be adopted "at the earliest opportunity", and used unofficially until formalised. AMs will debate the issue in the Senedd next Tuesday. Ms Hutt will table a motion proposing that "the National Assembly for Wales agrees that: (a) its name should be changed to the "Welsh Parliament" at the earliest opportunity; and that (b) it should be known unofficially by that name until such a name change can be formalised". A Welsh Government spokesperson said: "The First Minister is opening up debate among Assembly Members, early in the life of this Assembly, to consider the most appropriate name for the institution. "It is ultimately a matter for the National Assembly itself; legislation is not required to change what the institution calls itself." Asked for a response, a Wales Office spokesman said: "The Wales Bill will give the Assembly the power to call itself what it wants." Glyn Davies, the Conservative backbench MP for Montgomeryshire, said he would refer to the assembly as a parliament, saying on Facebook that AMs "should have done it years ago". In May, Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns spoke of the Wales Bill offering opportunities "to deliver a real parliament for Wales, with greater powers and a government responsible for raising as well as spending money". However, differences remain between the two governments on whether powers over income tax should be devolved without a referendum. Welsh Labour ministers claim that alleged underfunding of Wales by the UK Treasury should be addressed first, while some Tory MPs say their party should keep its promise to voters to hold a referendum.	The Welsh Assembly could be renamed the Welsh Parliament before AMs have the legal right to make the change.
The Times Educational Supplement (TES) says measures to guard against grade inflation were not appropriate for this year's English exams. Teaching unions have accused Ofqual of "regulatory failure" and say it is more evidence of flawed exam marking. But the regulator insists it applied its measures correctly. It comes as state and private school heads call for an independent inquiry into the problems. Last week Ofqual said it felt the way this year's English GCSE exams were graded was fair, despite the  grade boundaries being moved significantly part-way through the year. Teachers have complained that pupils achieving exactly the same marks would have received different grades depending on what time of year they sat the exam. And many who were predicted a grade C, obtained a grade D in their summer exams. Ofqual found that June's grade boundaries were correct, while January's were "too lenient". A key document sent to exam boards, which is on the Ofqual website, sets out how it expects exam boards to use a process known as "comparable outcomes" to ensure that grade standards are maintained between GCSEs year-on-year. It sets out five conditions for when such processes should be used to alter the way papers are marked. According to the TES report, this year's English GCSE and the circumstances around it failed to meet four of the conditions. The first of Ofqual's five conditions was that the cohort - or pupils from that year- in a subject "must be similar, in terms of ability, to those of previous years". But last week's report on English GCSEs noted that the "attainment profile" for 2012 dropped, as grammar and independent school pupils were replaced with extra, lower-achieving comprehensive pupils. The second condition was that the qualification must be "fit for purpose". On Monday, Education Secretary Michael Gove told Parliament that this year's English GCSE was "not fit for purpose". The third condition was that the "nature of the qualification" must be the same. Ofqual's report last week stated that "these qualifications are different from previous English qualifications in a number of ways". Finally, the regulator said in the letter that comparable outcomes must only be applied where "previous grades were appropriate". Ofqual's report said that the English GCSE grades in January were "too generous". The only condition that appears to have been met is that teaching standards have remained largely consistent. The guidelines also state: "Students should not be advantaged or disadvantaged simply because they were the first to sit a new set of examinations." The watchdog has interpreted its own conditions differently, and is insisting that the comparable outcomes approach that prevented grades from rising in June was correctly implemented. But Russell Hobby, general secretary of the NAHT heads' union, said: "Ofqual doesn't seem to have applied the concept of comparable outcomes properly. "In this instance there is a regulatory failure. It is a big mess." And Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said this appeared to be "another piece of evidence that procedures applied to this exam was not fit for purpose". Meanwhile, Ofqual said: "The comparable outcomes approach was used correctly for GCSE English this year and we stand by this decision. "Comparable outcomes are not intended to produce identical results year on year. "What's important is that outcomes can be compared when taking into consideration a range of factors which may affect the results. More details on the use of this approach can be found in our report." But Dr Christopher Ray, chairman of the Head Masters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), said the issue was evidence of a deeper problem with Ofqual. "The verdict of Ofqual's initial report and the reasoning to support it fall well short of answering the questions raised in the minds of schools and pupils." Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said: "It is clear that pupils, parents and education professionals, across the spectrum of schools, feel that pupils have been done a disservice. "Whilst the Education Secretary Michael Gove says he is 'saddened' by the injustice that has been served to thousands of pupils, he is showing how out-of-touch he is with pupil opinion by refusing to take action. Labour supports calls for an independent inquiry to get to the bottom of this mess." The Commons Education Committee is set to start an inquiry into the GCSE grading problems next week.	England exams regulator Ofqual breached its own rules in allowing controversial changes to the way English GCSEs were graded this summer, it is claimed.
The supermarket's stock fell by more than 4% to close at 197.8p. Over the weekend, press reports suggested the deal faced a lengthy investigation from competition regulators. Shares in Booker also fell, with the FTSE 250 company down 3.6%. Overall, the FTSE 100 ended down by 66 points at 7,118.48. Most major stock markets around the world fell after President Donald Trump's decision to impose a travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. Among the gainers in the UK, Vodafone rose after the mobile phone company said that its Indian unit was in merger talks. A combination of the two companies would create India's biggest telecoms firm. Shares rose 1.3%. On the FTSE 250, shares in WS Atkins jumped 6% following a report in the Times that the engineering company had been approached by US company CH2M over a possible merger. Flybe shares dipped 1.1% after the airline said it had seen a "slow start" to trading since the start of the new year, blaming "uncertain consumer confidence and poor weather". That was despite the carrier reporting "solid" trading for the final three months of 2016, with revenues boosted by extra capacity. Flybe said passenger revenues rose 13.5% in the quarter, compared with 5.7% in the previous six months. On the currency markets, the pound fell 0.5% against the dollar to $1.2484, but rose 0.4% against the euro to 1.1682 euros.	Shares in Tesco led the declines on the FTSE 100, giving up some of Friday's gains when the stock surged in the wake of news of its planned tie-up with food wholesaler Booker.
Bailey, 16, was stabbed during a fight with a fellow pupil at Cults Academy. The schoolboy's killer is serving nine years for culpable homicide. The review, conducted by child welfare professional Andrew Lowe, made 21 recommendations last October. Mr Swinney will give a statement on Tuesday. The review found the pupil's death was "potentially avoidable".	Deputy First Minister John Swinney will give MSPs his response to a report into the death of Aberdeen schoolboy Bailey Gwynne next week.
Industry magazine What Car? says prices of VW models have not collapsed as might have been expected. VW cars which are three years old, or have done 36,000 miles, are typically worth 42.21% of their original value, the magazine said. That is 2.7% lower than in September 2015, just before the scandal broke. However, across the industry as a whole, second hand values have fallen by 2% over the same timeframe, suggesting that Volkswagens have performed only slightly worse than the average car on the market. "I'm sure there are motorists out there who were rubbing their hands in glee at the thought of used VW prices falling off a cliff because of the emissions debacle," said What Car? editor Steve Huntingford. "That simply hasn't come to pass, however, and while the VW story continues to rumble on a year after the story first came to light, the Golf and Polo are still among the most popular new cars in the UK." The German car-maker admitted on 16 September last year that software had switched diesel engines to a "clean mode" whenever they were tested for emissions. VW has recalled 200,000 cars in the UK as a result. But while it is offering to repair them, it is not offering owners compensation. VW drivers in the US have been offered up to $10,000 each to make up for the deception. The What Car? research suggested that cars made by VW under the Audi brand experienced a similar drop in value to VW-badged cars over the past year. It also found that the value of second hand Seat and Skoda models, also made by the VW group, fell by less than 0.5% over the 12-month period.	Second hand Volkswagens appear to be holding their value well, a motoring magazine says, despite the emissions scandal which emerged a year ago.
The home secretary and Tory leadership candidate told the Daily Mail it would be "sheer madness" to give up the UK's nuclear deterrent because of the threat posed by countries including Russia. Renewing Trident would show Britain was "committed" to working with Nato allies after voting for Brexit, she added. Labour is split over Trident, with Jeremy Corbyn opposing its renewal. Mrs May, seen as the front runner in the contest to replace David Cameron, said there was a "rapidly changing terrorist threat" from groups including so-called Islamic State and Boko Haram. But she disputed the suggestion this meant the UK no longer needed a nuclear deterrent, saying the UK still faced threats from "conventional enemies". Mrs May said this included Russia, which had showed "renewed beligerence" in its annexation of Crimea, and North Korea, which she said "continues to defy international law with its nuclear programme". Since 1969, according to government documents, a British submarine carrying nuclear weapons has always been on patrol, gliding silently beneath the waves, somewhere in the world's oceans. The logic is to deter a nuclear attack on the UK because, even if the nation's conventional defence capabilities were destroyed, the silent submarine would still be able to launch a catastrophic retaliatory strike on the aggressor, a concept known as mutually assured destruction. The submarines carry up to eight Trident missiles; each can be fitted with a number of warheads. Read more about the history of the UK's nuclear weapons system Pledging to make a "strong defence an important priority" if she is elected leader of the Conservatives, Mrs May wrote: "In the face of such strong evidence, it would be sheer madness to contemplate even for a moment giving up Britain's independent nuclear deterrent. "And there is no room for compromise, and no room for cheese paring. "We need a full fleet of four submarines, capable between them of providing what the military call 'Continuous At Sea Deterrence', or permanent, around-the-clock cover. "Doing so will send an important message that, as Britain leaves the European Union, we remain committed to working alongside our Nato allies and playing our full role in the world." Parliament is to hold a vote later this year on whether to proceed with building successor submarines to the existing Vanguard fleet, which is due to become obsolete by the end of the next decade. Mrs May said the vote should take place before the Commons summer break begins on 21 July, adding "we should get on with getting it built". She said: "A lot of parliamentary business has, for obvious reasons, been put on hold until the leadership election is complete and a new prime minister is in post. "But when it comes to the nuclear deterrent, the national interest is clear, the Conservatives are united, and we have waited long enough." Labour has become split over the renewal of Trident following the election of leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is a life-long opponent of nuclear weapons. Mr Corbyn is at odds with many of his MPs over the future of the UK nuclear weapons system - which the government has estimated will cost Â£31bn to renew - and has commissioned a review led by shadow defence secretary Emily Thornberry to look at its future, likely to report in the summer. He has previously suggested the UK could keep its Trident submarine fleet but without carrying nuclear warheads. The Conservative leadership contest was sparked by Mr Cameron's decision to step down as prime minster after the UK voted by 52% to 48% to leave the EU, in the June referendum. The other candidates are energy minister Andrea Leadsom, Justice Secretary Michael Gove, Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb and former defence secretary Liam Fox. Party members will choose from the two backed by most Tory MPs, with the winner due to be named on 9 September. MPs are due to start the first round of voting later.	There should be a vote in the House of Commons on replacing Trident before the summer recess, Theresa May has said.
Hend, 43, carded a one-over-par 73 to finish on nine under after the third round at Wentworth. Hatton, 24, birdied five of his last eight holes to shoot a six-under 66. England's Lee Westwood (68) and YE Yang (75) are tied for third on seven under, while Masters champion Danny Willett (76) is a shot further back. Hend complained after his round about the behaviour of some spectators towards him over the closing holes, as he played in the final match with Willett. The Australian said: "Danny was getting all the crowd support and I had no problem with that. But there were a couple of guys out there who were really over the top and it wasn't very nice what they were saying. "It was quite rude and personal and if it was up to me I would have had them thrown out. "Danny and I are mates. I've played with him before and he wants me to do well and I want him to do well. But when you get hecklers in the crowd saying pretty rude things as they were, I was ready to punch them." Willett again struggled on the back nine. Having coming home in 39 after a tournament record first-nine of 29 in his second round, Willett took 41 strokes on Saturday. The 28-year-old Englishman said: "It's disappointing to be somewhere there or thereabouts and then to play poorly on the back nine like we did yesterday. "We had everything under control nicely and then a couple of loose shots, a couple of bad decisions, a couple of missed putts and very quickly it kind of slipped away." Hatton, who has finished fifth, 13th and 12th in his last three events, set the clubhouse target more than two hours before the leaders finished after firing the day's lowest score. He said: "I've been walking around this place since (I was) a five-year-old and I was in awe of the guys inside of the rope. "For me now, playing my third BMW PGA, it's great. I love this event." England's Westwood is playing the event for a 23rd year in a row and is targeting a first win after a second-place finish in 2000 and losing a play-off to Luke Donald in 2011. Westwood, who finished second to Willett at the Masters in April, maintained his ever-present run after taking painkillers to help overcome a foot ligament injury sustained while running on Tuesday. He said: "For a pro to win the PGA at any stage in their career is special. But to do it at 43 years old, in my 23rd appearance and having been in contention a lot before, would be great. "I've played well here in the past and having finished second in the Masters and 10th in the Irish Open, I was surprised to be 33-1 going into this week. "I haven't played a lot at the start of the year, so I'm pretty fresh coming into this part of the season. Normally I would have played 15 events and I've only played six. I'm looking forward to a run of golf now." We've launched a new BBC Sport newsletter ahead of the Euros and Olympics, bringing all the best stories, features and video right to your inbox.

The visitors' swift, sharp passing and ruthlessness in the final third created goals for Andy Halliday, Jason Holt and the excellent Barrie McKay. Martyn Waghorn scored two penalties as Rangers made it eight wins from eight. In the home ranks, striker Derek Lyle was dismissed after going head-to-head with Rob Kiernan, with Aidan Smith netting a late breakaway consolation. Rangers sought to play with pace from the off, as captain Lee Wallace latched onto the lively McKay's pass at full tilt down the left, surging into the home box, but finding neither a team-mate nor the bottom corner with his bobbling ball across the face of goal. And McKay was instrumental in Rangers' opener, driving at the defence, exchanging passes with Waghorn, and playing in Halliday to clip the ball across goalkeeper Robbie Thomson. A knee injury deprived Rangers of their skipper shortly after the half-hour mark, before Hibernian loanee Alex Harris stung the palms of Wes Foderingham in the away goal with a driven strike from the right of the area. Minutes later Chris Higgins, who had already clattered the speeding James Tavernier early on, allowed Waghorn the opportunity to attack again with an awful looping backwards header in his own half, but made amends with a smart block in the box. On the stroke of half-time, Ryan Conroy wasted a fine chance for Queens on the break, as he opted to square for Lyle rather than shoot himself, with Danny Wilson sliding in smartly to block. Three minutes after the break, with Mark Millar booked for treading on the prone Gedion Zelalem, Lyle was dismissed on the advice of fourth official Crawford Allan. The striker went forehead-to-forehead with Kiernan, and the minimal forward motion he made with his head was in full view of Allan, who advised referee Bobby Madden to show a red card. If things were not bad enough for Queens, they got worse three minutes later, as Andy Dowie shouldered Dominic Ball to the ground in the box as the midfielder raced to reach Tavernier's square ball with the empty net beckoning. Right-back Dowie, who had been torn apart by the pace and trickery of McKay during the first half, was only shown yellow. Waghorn slammed home the resultant spot-kick, and from that point Rangers' high-tempo passing football was too much for the hosts. Holt ran unchallenged into the Queens area, and finished Zelalem's through ball at the second time of asking to bag the visitors' third. And more smart, intricate passing from Waghorn and Kenny Miller allowed McKay to tap home a deserved fourth on 65 minutes. Rangers boss Mark Warburton introduced the flamboyant Nathan Oduwa for the final 20 minutes, with the substitute drawing several fouls from the home defence. After Oduwa was chopped down on the edge of the area, Iain Russell raised his arm high to block the resultant free-kick, and Waghorn thumped his second penalty beyond Thomson. Queens did get off the mark in the final 10 minutes, young striker Smith capitalising on a long central punt and holding off Kiernan well to knock the ball past Foderingham.

The black and white story sees Patrick Troughton's second Doctor battle robot yeti in the London Underground. Also recovered is a complete version of Troughton's six-part story The Enemy of the World. It is thought to be the largest haul of missing episodes recovered in the last three decades. "It's thrilling," said Mark Gatiss, an actor and writer for the 21st Century incarnation of Doctor Who. "Every single avenue seemed to have been exhausted, every now and then something turns up - but to have two virtually complete stories out of the blue is absolutely incredible." The BBC destroyed many of the sci-fi drama's original transmission tapes in the 1960s and 1970s. However, many episodes were transferred on to film for sale to foreign broadcasters. It is often these prints found in other countries that are the source of retrieved episodes. In this case, 11 Doctor Who episodes were discovered, nine of which were missing, in the Nigerian city of Jos. The find was made by Philip Morris, director of a company called Television International Enterprises Archive. Mr Morris said: "The tapes had been left gathering dust in a storeroom at a television relay station in Nigeria. I remember wiping the dust off the masking tape on the canisters and my heart missed a beat as I saw the words, Doctor Who. When I read the story code I realised I'd found something pretty special." He said it had been a "lucky" find given the high temperatures in the African country. "Fortunately they had been kept in the optimum condition." Only episode three of The Enemy of the World already existed in the BBC archive. The Nigerian discovery of episodes one, two, four, five and six complete the story. Episode one of fan favourite The Web of Fear existed, with the rest thought lost forever. Now episodes two, four, five and six have been recovered. Episode three is still missing, but has been reconstructed from stills to enable restored versions of both stories to be made available for sale via download on Friday. The latest find means that the number of missing episodes of Doctor Who has dropped from 106 to 97. One episode from each story - both last seen in 1968 - were shown at a special event in London on Thursday by BBC Worldwide, the BBC's commercial arm. Among the guests were actors Frazer Hines and Deborah Watling, who played Troughton's Tardis companions Jamie McCrimmon and Victoria Waterfield. Episode one of The Enemy of the World is a James Bond-style thriller complete with an exploding helicopter, a hovercraft, gun-toting henchmen and a foreign-accented villain, Salamander (also played by Troughton). The story opens with the Tardis arriving on an Australian beach where the Doctor strips to his long johns and goes for a dip in the sea. The Web of Fear is a claustrophobic tale that sees the Doctor battle his old foe, the Great Intelligence, and the yeti in the tunnels of the London tube system. "It's the quintessential Doctor Who story," said Gatiss. "It has the return of the Abominable Snowmen in an iconic location." He said it showed Troughton "at the height of his powers". Frazer Hines recalled that the underground station sets had been so realistic that London Transport accused the BBC of filming at a tube station in secret. The story also featured an appearance by Deborah Watling's real-life father Jack, reprising his role as Professor Travers. Recalling Troughton's "wonderful sense of humour" on set, Watling said: "We all got on so well, we were like a family and Pat was always to me like another dad or an uncle.  We had a chemistry and I think it showed." How did she feel when she heard about the recovery of the lost episodes? "I couldn't quite believe it. There had been hoaxes before. I thought it was just another hoax." Her only other complete story in the archive had been The Tomb of the Cybermen, all four instalments of which were discovered in Hong Kong in 1991. Hines said: "This now gives me hope that more stories of Patrick's will come out of the woodwork." The latest find comes as Doctor Who celebrates its 50th birthday. A special episode featuring the current Doctor, Matt Smith, and his predecessor, David Tennant, will be shown on the programme's anniversary on 23 November.	Nine missing episodes of 1960s Doctor Who have been found at a TV station in Nigeria, including most of the classic story The Web of Fear.
The Slovenian club has knocked Hibernian, Rangers and Celtic out of Europe in recent seasons. Yet McInnes is adamant that his players are not fearful of the quality of the opposition or their record. "We're not daunted by it," McInnes said. "We're confident in our ability to get the right result." Aberdeen's manager has told fans to expect an assertive first-leg display on Thursday and urged them to back the team. "We've learned over the last few seasons to deal with European football," McInnes continued. "I like the technical and tactical part of it. Our supporters should expect to see a confident Aberdeen team. "They are favourites, we're the underdogs, but we were underdogs against Riejka [last season], we were underdogs against Groningen [in 2014]. "They'll take confidence from their recent history, and not just against Scottish teams. "We want to represent ourselves first and foremost, get the reputation of our club at the forefront of people's minds, and help Scottish football at the same time. "Those first two rounds always have trepidation about them, because players aren't fully up to speed, they're playing against teams that are relatively unknown and there's pressure in that. "We've now come out the other side of those ties and we're now the underdogs going into this game. I'm happy to deal with the favourites tag and happy to deal with the underdogs tag." McInnes warns that Maribor will be accomplished and dangerous opponents in the first leg of the third qualifying round tie on Thursday at Pittodrie. He will send his side out in search of a victory, but also with the awareness that the contest can be won in Slovenia on away goals, so keeping a clean sheet is important. "What was telling from [Maribor's win over Levski Sofia in the last round] was their maturity and calmness, even when they went behind they kept playing their game," McInnes said. "That comes from playing European football and they look like a team confident within their shape. They've got a way of playing, very well organised, and the refusal to panic when they went behind has got them through into this tie. "They play 4-4-1-1, they can play a bit deeper and they counter-attack quickly. We need to be aware of that and recognise the areas where we want to play and look after the ball, especially against a team that is quick to get forward. "We want to win the game at home, [but] it's important we still have a result going over to Maribor. "Ideally we want to impose ourselves and get that balance between attacking and defending right, but we don't want to be giving ourselves a mountain to climb by losing goals at Pittodrie."	Derek McInnes believes Aberdeen have the confidence and experience to overcome being underdogs against Maribor in the Europa League.
Marie Logie's body was found in her first-floor flat in Green Gates, Leven, at 20:00 on Tuesday. She had last been seen alive at 08:00 that day. Mrs Logie had sustained head injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene by the Scottish Ambulance Service. Her family paid tribute to the "beloved mother, grandmother and friend". They said Mrs Logie would be sadly missed, adding that she was "born, bred and lived in the Leven area all her life". "The family are assisting the police in the investigation and wish to be left alone at this difficult time," they added. Detectives said there were no signs of a break in and so far no clear motive but they said Mrs Logie was murdered in "a brutal" way. Mrs Logie was said to be independent, capable and was an active member of the local church. She had spent the festive period with one of her sons in England, returning home in the new year. Police said Mrs Logie's neighbour had spoken to her in the morning. She told the neighbour she was going to the shops and then to the hospital to visit a friend. When the neighbour did not hear from Mrs Logie again he went to investigate and found her dead in her home. Det Ch Insp Keith Hardie, of Police Scotland, said: "She had a brutal head injury. "An 82-year-old woman in the safety of her own home being subjected to such a brutal attack is horrendous." "Whoever has been responsible for causing Mary's death has preyed on a vulnerable and elderly member of the community and we are pursuing various lines of inquiry as part of this ongoing investigation. "I would ask that anyone who remembers seeing anything suspicious in the Green Gates area in the days and hours before Mary was found contacts police immediately. "In addition, anyone with any other information that can help us find Mary's killer should also get in touch." Mrs Logan's local Church of Scotland minister said the whole community had been "shocked" and "stunned" by the murder. The Rev Gilbert Nisbet, of Leven Parish Church, said: "Mary was part of the church community and very much involved in the life of the church. "I have been the minister here for nine years and she came virtually every Sunday and I would chat to her at the door. "Mary was friendly and outgoing, a kind lady who was bright and interesting to talk to. People are absolutely stunned."	An 82-year-old woman found murdered in her Fife home was the victim of a "brutal and horrendous attack", police have said.
The Posh lost for the third successive time since their cup defeat when they were beaten 2-1 at home by Oldham. "They're falling short of the standards that they're capable of, and they have done since the FA Cup tie. "I've got to believe that there's some sort of hangover going on," Westley told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire. "A young group of lads have built themselves up almost into a frenzy to go and play and win a massive game in their minds, they've got so close, they've given so much, perhaps physically and mentally it drained them." Tuesday's defeat kept Peterborough 12th in League One, eight points off the play-off places. Media playback is not supported on this device "I've tried to deal with it game-by-game through selection and through talking to them as people, but we haven't snapped ourselves out of this apparent malaise," added 47-year-old Westley. "On a motivational level we're not tracking back runners, we're not showing enough discipline to play the way we're coaching them to play, we're not showing enough belief in our game, we're slow, we're lacking urgency, there are so many things missing, "But I don't think they're bad people, I don't think they're downing tools and not producing the goods because they can't be bothered, I just think they've lost their way."	Peterborough United are still suffering from their FA Cup penalty shootout loss to West Bromwich Albion, according to manager Graham Westley.
The city's mayor, Joao Doria, said he did not want to see an "open-air shopping mall for drugs". He said he wanted to move the addicts on and provide them with medical services and housing. Critics say his policies are pushing the problem to other parts of the city. At the end of May, 500 armed police officers were deployed to clear the main streets in the area of Sao Paulo known as "Cracolandia" or "Crackland". Nearly 40 people were arrested during the operation for drug-trafficking and many of the addicts fled into neighbouring streets. The biggest concentration went to Princess Isabel square around 300 metres (330 yds) from the main Crackland area. During the second operation on Sunday police brought in bulldozers to clear the shacks and tents set up by the addicts in the square. The mayor said: "We wont be turning back. The idea is not to move them elsewhere,  we intend to provide the addicts with support and try to guarantee their survival." He has promised to restore and renovate the area providing social housing, schools, kindergartens and hospitals using private and public investments. Although many people agree in Sao Paulo over the need for intensive policing in the area, Mr Doria has divided opinion over his suggestion that the addicts should receive compulsory rehabilitation treatment. But workers say many addicts are fearful and hostile to them now and that Mr Doria's policies are destroying years of work building relationships with the addicts. Social workers also point to the need to provide jobs and housing. The Doria administration ended a programme introduced by the previous left-wing mayor of Sao Paulo, Fernando Haddad, which had offered hotel rooms in Crackland for a small daily sum to drug addicts who worked in jobs like road-sweeping or gardening. The mayor has instead recently announced an offer of 100 jobs by a fast food chain to homeless people in general, of which there are around 20,000 in Sao Paulo.	Security forces in Sao Paulo have cleared a central square of crack addicts and homeless people who fled from a similar police operation nearby nearly a month ago.
KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) reported that the rate of expansion in hiring employees sank to a four-month low. The rate of growth in short-term jobs however had sped up since April, the report addded. It suggested that companies needed time to "digest the election result", which saw the Conservatives win a majority. The number of job vacancies made available also fell to their slowest in 2015. Although starting salaries for permanent employees continued to grow, the pace of growth sank to its lowest since April's nine-month high. Recruitment agencies reported that the pay of temporary and contracted staff also continued to grow, although at its slowest since January. The availability of temporary staff saw its fastest drop in seven months, leading recruitment consultants to report difficulties in hiring suitable people. KPMG partner Bernard Brown said: "The UK job market saw a slight slowdown in May, as those on boards took time to digest the election result and work out the ramifications for their business. " The public sector continues to suffer, with pay growth rising by just 0.2% in the last reported quarter."	The pace of hiring permanent staff in the UK slowed down in May, according to a report.
Leon Mugesera, an academic, was extradited back to his home country from Canada four years ago. He made his incendiary speech against the Tutsi minority in 1992. Some 800,000 people died in the genocide. Mugesera later worked as a lecturer in Quebec province and lost a 12-year legal battle to avoid extradition. In 1992, then an official in Rwanda's ruling Hutu party, Mugesera  told more than 1,000 party members that they should kill Tutsis and dump their bodies in the river. Mugesera later maintained his innocence, saying the speech had been taken out of context. The genocide ended when rebels, led by current Tutsi President Paul Kagame, seized power in July 1994. Militias from the majority Hutu ethnic group were blamed for the mass slaughter.	A former politician who described Tutsis as "cockroaches" and called for their extermination has been jailed for life in Rwanda over the 1994 genocide.
Forensic expert Susan Williamson was giving evidence at the trial of William Burns and Alexander Porter, who deny attacking Russell Findlay. The High Court in Glasgow heard she examined a jacket, mail bag, a knife and a jar that had contained acid. The jury was told DNA matching Mr Burns was found on the jacket. Prosecutor Richard Goddard asked Miss Williamson: "When you examined the jacket you obtained a DNA profile which matched William Burns," and she replied: "Yes." Ms Williamson told the court that she also examined the handle of the knife found at the scene and said the major DNA contributor was Mr Porter. The court was told the odds on the DNA belonging to anyone else not related to the men was a billion to one. Defence counsel Susan Duff, representing Mr Porter, said: "There are a number of ways DNA could have got there," and Ms Williamson said: "Yes." As well as working for the Sun newspaper, Mr Findlay is the author of books about Glasgow crime gangs. Mr Findlay has already given evidence alleging that a man claiming to be a postman came to his door at 08:30 on 23 December 2015. The journalist said the man, whom he identified as Burns, threw liquid onto the right side of his face and right eye. The jury has heard from an eye specialist that Mr Findlay's sight could have been saved by a neighbour dousing is face with water. Mr Burns, 56, and Mr Porter, 48, also deny attempting to murder Ross Sherlock by shooting at him repeatedly near St Helen's Primary School in Bishopbriggs on 24 September 2015. The trial before Judge Sean Murphy QC continues.	DNA matching two men accused of throwing acid at the face of a Scottish Sun journalist was found on items at the scene, a court has heard.
Edward Maher was questioning the soldier in charge of risk assessment during the exercise in July 2013. He said instructors did not notice for nearly an hour that his son, L/Cpl Edward Maher, was "overdue, over time, and off track" on the march. Fellow reservists L/Cpl Craig Roberts and Cpl James Dunsby also died. L/Cpl Maher's father questioned why a soldier, known as 1B to protect his identity, did not did not realise his son had gone "off track" until 16:10 BST when he had been expected at the next checkpoint at 15:34 BST. Soldier 1B explained he had only noticed L/Cpl Maher's tracking device on the screen at that time. Mr Maher said: "They were overdue, overtime, off track… do you think that your process had failed?" "At that time sir, no I [didn't]," the soldier replied. Earlier on Tuesday, soldier 1B told the inquest it was not in his thought process to stop the test because most soldiers were doing well during the 16-mile (26km) test on one of the hottest days of that year. He told the hearing in Solihull that of the 78 reservists taking part that day, six had withdrawn by early afternoon - two for medical reasons. But he said he was not concerned because the course was "tough". "They were all completing the march on time.... at that time the two casualties had recovered within 10 minutes… none of the qualified medics there told me they needed qualified assistance," he said. "All of the other runners were all within time… that includes Craig, that includes Ed, that includes James. "Were there alarm bells ringing in my head at that time? No there was not." David Turner QC, representing Cpl Dunsby's widow Bryher, asked 1B if he would have continued the march if commanding officer 1A had told him about the heat illness casualties. "I would have looked at what was going on… everyone is pushing themselves… it takes a different type of person to operate within that theatre, at that time I would have said it would not have been within my thought process to stop that march," he said. Soldier 1B said he told candidates to be aware of the hot weather and rising temperatures, but he did not consider heat exhaustion to be a greater risk than normal. He also said he was not made aware of new guidance on heat injuries and when an exercise should be stopped, following the death of a marine in similar circumstances in 2008. The inquest is continuing.	The father of a reservist who died after attempting an SAS selection exercise in the Brecon Beacons has told an inquest processes "failed" that day.
The 1,905 claimants had alleged they suffered harm while being held on PNG's Manus Island between 2012 and 2016. The government said it "strongly denied" the allegations but that settling was a "prudent" decision. Australia turns away any refugees and asylum seekers arriving by boat and sends them to PNG and Nauru. It says this deters migrants from attempting the life-threatening voyage to its shores in trafficking boats. But the policy has been heavily criticised both at home and internationally, including by the United Nations. The Manus case was due to be heard in the Victoria Supreme Court on Wednesday. But shortly before the trial began, lawyers for the claimants said the government and its service providers had offered a last minute settlement of A$70m. They also offered to cover costs estimated to be more than A$20m. The full details of the settlement and the financial package are yet to be fully approved by the court. Despite the millions of dollars it has cost, and the critical headlines it has generated, the Australian government is unlikely to regret its policy of sending asylum seekers offshore. Telling refugees that they will not be allowed to enter Australia until their case has been processed seems to have been a powerful deterrent. Just yesterday the prime minister boasted that more than 1,000 days had passed without a successful people-smuggling expedition to Australia. The more pressing problem is what to do with the hundreds of refugees who remain on Manus Island and Nauru. While the US has agreed to honour a deal to consider them for resettlement, it seems unlikely that all would pass the "extreme vetting" procedure. And with the Manus Island centre due to close in October, time is running out for a long-term solution. The principal lawyer for the claimants, Andrew Baker, said the settlement would help them to "put this dark chapter of their lives behind them". But Australia's Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said the government "strongly refutes and denies the claims made in these proceedings". In a statement, he said that had the case gone to trial it would have cost "tens of millions of dollars in legal fees alone, with an unknown outcome", and the government decided a settlement was a "prudent outcome for Australian taxpayers". As of last year, residents were allowed to freely come and go from the facility but the debate over their resettlement is ongoing. Australia has insisted that no-one held on Manus or Nauru will ever be re-settled in Australia.	The Australian government and its contractors have offered compensation totalling A$70m (Â£41m; $53m) to refugees detained in Papua New Guinea.
One of the 11 children described how the trailer went "really fast down the hill" at the farm in Nottinghamshire before it "launched us off". Two members of teaching staff from Halam Primary and a farmer were also injured in the accident on 11 March. The acting head teacher of the school has apologised. One of the children, Ben, said he was frightened and the other children were crying. "The trailer gone like really fast down the hill and it gone sideways and it launched us off," said Ben. When asked how it made him feel, Ben said: "It feels like sad." Ben's mother, Sheree Cockayne, said he has been struggling to sleep since it happened and has been having nightmares and flashbacks. Mrs Cockayne, who was told about the accident by a school nurse, said: "I rushed to the QMC (Queen's Medical Centre) and Ben was brought in. He had blood all over his face. "He just laid there really shocked. He had to stay in [hospital] overnight for observation every four hours because he had concussion and felt really sick. "He's still got bruises to his head, his ribs and his chest, so he still has a few pains." Nottinghamshire County Council said another child was discharged from hospital after a check-up and one was brought into hospital later in the day for a scan, then released. A teaching assistant sustained a broken wrist, a teaching student sustained a head wound requiring stitches and the farmer, who was also in the trailer, dislocated his shoulder. The assistant will be off work for four weeks. The children were on a trip at Hills Farm in Edingley and the accident happened on Carver's Hollow. Nottinghamshire Police is investigating the incident, rather then the Health and Safety Executive, because the area where it happened is a highway. The force has asked anyone with information to contact them. Hills Farm in Edingley, where it happened, said it would not comment while an investigation is ongoing. The school's acting head teacher, Paul Nolan, said: "We are very sorry this unfortunate incident happened and we wish the children and adults who were injured a speedy recovery. "This incident has affected the whole community and everyone is supporting each other as a result." Marion Clay, the council's acting service director for education standards, said: "This is an established trip for reception pupils and as far as we know at this time all the appropriate procedures were carried out."	A group of primary school children were injured on a trip to a farm when the trailer they were in became detached from the tractor pulling it.
Basil McAfee was found dead by his mother at his home in Henderson Avenue, north Belfast, on 20 December 2013. Police said he "suffered a violent death" and added that they believed his killer used an axe and a large knife. They said that although it was not a random attack, his killer remains a danger to others in the community. The police officer leading the murder investigation, Det Ch Insp John McVea, said: "It is a year since Basil died and his death has slipped somewhat from public consciousness. "But it remains an enduring heartache for his family - his mother, siblings and his grown-up children. "They are about to face a second Christmas without Basil and without knowing why this happened to him and who is responsible." Mr McAfee, a father-of-two, was attacked in the living room of his home and police have released a photograph of the murder scene as part of the renewed appeal. The 50-year-old had been stabbed a number of times and sustained head wounds consistent with being hit with an axe. The investigating officer described the murder as a "ferocious attack". "He suffered a violent death at the hands of an assailant who was probably wielding an axe and a long-bladed knife," Mr McVea said. He confirmed that items, including money, were taken from Mr McAfee's house. "Although we believe the attack was not random, but focused on Basil, whoever did this is a danger to others in the community while still at large," the detective added. The last public sighting of Mr McAfee was in an off-licence on the Cavehill Road, close to his home, on the afternoon of Thursday 19 December 2013. Shortly after the murder, police released CCTV images showing the victim shopping in the off-licence in a bid to get witnesses to come forward. However, they have now said they believe other people visited Mr McAfee who have not yet contacted detectives. Anyone with information about the case is asked to contact police on the non-emergency number 101. Alternatively, they can speak to the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.	Detectives investigating the murder of a man who they believe was attacked with an axe have renewed their appeal on the first anniversary of his death.
Tevez, who missed a penalty against Wigan last Saturday, was back on the bench for the midweek Champions League game against Napoli. Mancini insists that Tevez, who failed to secure a summer move away from the club, must accept the situation. "In this moment there are players that are better than him but Carlos is here training," he said. "Carlos will have a chance to play. I don't know if he is happy but every player that can't play is not happy. This is normal. "He will have his moment." The form of fellow strikers Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero, who have scored six league goals apiece so far this season, mean that the 27-year-old Argentina international's chances have been limited, while Mario Balotelli has also played just one league game. But Mancini believes his free-scoring side still need to be more ruthless in front of goal than neighbours and arch-rivals Manchester United, who have scored 18 goals - three more than City - in their first four Premier League games. When City underlined their title credentials with a 5-1 win at Tottenham last month, United bettered them with a 8-2 victory over Arsenal. Mancini's men impressed again by beating Wigan 3-0 last week, only for United to hammer Bolton 5-0. The Italian said: "Man United are a top team - they have been used to winning for a long time. They have strong players. "When they played against Arsenal, when they scored two or three goals, they continued trying to score. "We need to have this mentality. If we have a game like Tottenham where we can score, we need to continue to try to play."	Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini says Carlos Tevez must wait for his chance to get back into the team.
Media playback is not supported on this device Two-time double Olympic champion Sir Mo Farah struggled on the Holyrood Park course, finishing in seventh. Turkey's Yasemin Can, representing Europe, won the women's race, while Britain's Harriet Knowles-Jones claimed the junior women's title. Captain Laura Muir anchored Britain to victory in the 4x1km mixed relay. The team event was won by USA, with Europe second and Great Britain third. Hawkins, 24, led for most of the men's race until he was passed in the final 15m by Kenyan-born Korir, who won in a time of 24 minutes three seconds. "I put everything in to dropping him but he was the stronger man at the end," the Scot told BBC Sport. Newly knighted Farah, 33, finished 46 seconds adrift of Korir, with 2016 champion Garrett Heath of the United States in sixth. "It was a hard day at the office," Farah told BBC Sport. "I'm a little bit behind where I would usually be at this stage of the season. "But I'm not panicking this early on in the year - I've got to get ready for London 2017." With Farah out of contention early on in the 8km race, Hawkins took the initiative to break clear with Korir and Heath, before the latter faded. Hawkins, who finished ninth in the marathon at last summer's Olympics in Rio, repeatedly tried to drop Korir on the small rises around the course and appeared to have a winning gap coming into the final straight. But Korir, who finished 14th in the 10,000m final in Rio, won by Farah, had the greater kick in the final sprint to surge past the Scot and claim the title. "I was really tired at the end and he just wouldn't leave me alone," joked Hawkins, who will run in the marathon at this summer's World Championships in London. After breaking the 25-year-old British indoor 5,000m record on Wednesday, Muir produced a stellar final lap to secure Britain victory in the invitational Stewart Cup 4x1km mixed relay. Muir took the baton from James West level with USA but quickly surged clear as Britain won in a time of 11 minutes, 10 seconds, with the first two legs run by James Bowness and Charlene Thomas respectively. "In my role as captain I wanted to put out a good job for the team and when I saw the others placing well I had to bring it home for them," Muir told BBC Sport. "I wasn't used to being the one to watch but I'm there now and it's great - people are recognising that I'm running fast and I want to keep it that way." Elsewhere, Kenyan-born runner Can dominated the women's 6km event to win in a time of 20 minutes 36 seconds, with Ireland's Fionnuala McCormack, also racing for Europe, 21 seconds adrift in second. Noah Affolder of the United States won the junior men's race, with Scott Beattie the highest-placed Briton in eighth.	Great Britain's Callum Hawkins was beaten into second by USA's Leonard Korir in a dramatic sprint finish at the Great Edinburgh Cross Country.
Top-flight sides Birmingham City and Manchester City will meet at the national stadium on Saturday, 13 May. The attendance is now set to surpass the 32,912 that saw Arsenal Ladies beat Chelsea 1-0 in the 2016 final. Wembley staged the event for the first time in 2015 and is set to continue doing so for the foreseeable future. Birmingham - who won the trophy at Ashton Gate in 2012, in front of fewer than 9,000 people - are in their second final, while Women's Champions League semi-finalists Manchester City are yet to win the competition. The 2016 Women's Super League One champions beat Liverpool in this year's semi-finals, while Birmingham knocked out 2015 winners Chelsea on penalties.	The Women's FA Cup Final is set for a new competition-record crowd at Wembley, with 34,500 tickets already sold eight days before the 2017 final.
Michael McGibbon, 33, died after an attack in an alleyway at Butler Place, with police saying his killing carried the hallmarks of a paramilitary murder. The 34-year-old was arrested in Belfast on Sunday. Mr McGibbon was married with a young family. A priest, Father Gary Donegan, told the BBC's Sunday News programme how Mr McGibbon's wife tried to save his life when she arrived at the scene. Mrs McGibbon, who is a nurse, came to his aid shortly after the shooting. Police have said Mr McGibbon had contacted them to inform them that two masked men had arrived at his house on Thursday evening. The men asked him to come out of the house but he refused, and they told him they would return. Mr McGibbon's murder had been referred to the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.	A 34-year-old man is still being questioned over the murder of a man who was shot in the legs in north Belfast on Friday night.
Lego refused a bulk order for bricks that were to be used in a new artwork about political dissidents as part of an exhibition in Melbourne, Australia. Toymaker Lego said it never sold directly to anyone wanting to use its product to make a political statement. The artist has since been deluged with offers of Lego from supporters. Ai used Lego last year to create portraits of 175 dissident figures who had been jailed or exiled, from Nelson Mandela to Edward Snowden, on the site of the former Alcatraz prison near San Francisco. He planned a similar work for the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, but a bulk order placed by the museum was rejected by the Danish company. The Chinese artist said the company told the museum its bricks could not be used for artworks containing "any political, religious, racist, obscene or defaming statements". Referring to The Lego Movie's slogan "everything is awesome", Ai wrote on Twitter: "Lego will tell us what to do, or not to do. That is awesome!" He added: "Lego is giving us the definition of what is 'political', and all the big corporations are telling us what to love or hate. That is awesome." In an Instagram post, he wrote: "As a commercial entity, Lego produces and sells toys, movies and amusement parks attracting children across the globe. "As a powerful corporation, Lego is an influential cultural and political actor in the globalized economy with questionable values. "Lego's refusal to sell its product to the artist is an act of censorship and discrimination." Lego spokesman Roar Rude Trangbaek would not comment directly on the case but said that, as a principle, Lego "respects any individual's right to free, creative expression". But he added that the company had a long-standing policy not to directly sell to anyone if it knew that its bricks would be used to make a political statement. The artist also linked Lego's stance with plans for a new Legoland in Shanghai. Lego said the theme park was being built by Merlin Entertainment and not Lego, but that Lego does have some ties with Merlin because it uses the Lego brand. Ai Weiwei is known for his criticism of the Chinese government as well as for being one of the world's leading contemporary artists. He was arrested during a crackdown on political activists in China in 2011 and was released without charge after 81 days. The Chinese authorities kept his passport for four years, but it was returned earlier this year.	Artist Ai Weiwei has accused Lego of "censorship and discrimination" after the company refused to allow him to use its bricks in a new exhibition.
Two-year-old Hank was removed by dog wardens last month and taken for testing. A court in Belfast heard he had been assessed by an expert to be a pit bull terrier-type. However, it has been recommended that he be placed on the council's exemption register. Hank will undergo behavioural training and will also be kept on a lead and muzzled while in public. As the the exemption order was signed, one of Hank's owners - Joanne Meadows - broke down in tears in the public gallery while supporters applauded. "We knew what was happening today but it was just such a relief to know that it actually was happening," she said. "Until the judge said the words, we were just feared in case something changed, so it means so much. "I just can't get over that I'm going to be able to see him later on today." Miss Meadows said she did worry that this day may never come. "Even when we were told that was the decision on Thursday, I just didn't want to believe it until it actually happened because I just didn't want to get my hopes up because I just missed him so much," she said. A solicitor for the family thanked all those who helped with the campaign to free Hank, which attracted worldwide attention and support from celebrities including presenter Dermot O'Leary, boxer Carl Frampton and celebrity dog trainer Victoria Stillwell. An online petition to have Hank returned was signed by more than 280,000 people. Under Article 25(a) of the Dogs (Northern Ireland) Order 1983 some types of dog, including pit bulls, are deemed inherently dangerous and can be destroyed. Hank is the 12th dog to be placed on the exemption register since 2011. The couple have said their fight is not over as they believe the current legislation is fundamentally flawed and want it overhauled. They are planning a rally at Stormont next Sunday and said they  simply could not just walk away and leave other dog owners in the same situation. Hank's other owner, Leonard Collins said they did not think he would have been coming home so soon without the public support they had been offered. "Belfast City Council, when the pressure was put on, they expedited the process," he said. "We've spoken to people going through similar situations in England and here and it seemed to be that once this picked up public pressure, they wanted it finished as soon as possible." "We'd just like to thank everyone across the world, never mind Northern Ireland, Belfast, the media, friends, family, just everybody," Miss Meadows said.	A dog seized by Belfast City Council for "looking like a pit bull" has been reunited with his owners.
They are the stars of a new South Korean apocalyptic thriller terrorising audiences and breaking box office records at home and set to open in cinemas across Asia this week. Director Yeon Sang-ho's adrenaline-filled Train to Busan premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival. Blood, brains and mayhem all feature prominently as hordes of zombies devour unfortunate passengers trapped on board a bullet train from Seoul. Train to Busan is South Korea's first home-grown zombie offering and has already achieved local box office success, taking a record $5.76m (Â£4.33m) on its opening day in July. The movie starts off with an innocent enough train journey, until a viral outbreak outside starts to infect passengers on board, turning them into the undead. The Korean government eventually declares a state of emergency and martial law. At the heart of the chaos is actor Gong Yoo, a typically-workaholic South Korean businessman travelling with his estranged daughter, oblivious to the unfolding apocalypse. The monsters are fast, really fast, and their attacks lightning speed, putting their Hollywood counterparts from World War Z to shame. Equally terrifying is the infection and the rate at which it spreads rapidly between those unlucky enough to be trapped onboard as the high-speed train races to its final destination. To young Koreans like student Hahn Kwan-woo, 23, it is the film they have been waiting for. "Western films featuring zombies have always been huge hits in our country and there was not a single Korean zombie movie until 'Train to Busan' came out," he said. "Many of my favourite actors also star in the movie." It may have all the predictable elements of a zombie story, but aficionados have also praised the film's uniquely South Korean take on the genre. "With a Mers epidemic [Middle East respiratory syndrome] sweeping South Korea in 2015 and soaring discontent with corruption and economic disparity, a zombie apocalypse serves as a potent allegory for the dog-eat-dog world," film critic Maggie Lee explained in one review. Stunning visual and special effects and "lean, gritty" screenplay also could not have hurt its chances of domestic success. Other critics praised the "brilliant" choice of setting on a Korean bullet train. "I even have a friend who loved it because she takes the same train every time she goes home," said Mr Hahn. But timing was also key, due to the appetite for summertime horror movies, said Jean Lee, a journalist and Wilson Center Global Fellow who also teaches Korean culture and film courses. "South Korean horror films really took off in the late 1990s and 'Train to Busan' is a new twist on the horror genre," she told BBC News from Seoul. "Most horror movies here are released in the summer, when the heat and humidity send people into air-conditioned theatres for movies that quite literally send a chill up their spines." Of course the best part about zombie movies is getting to see the best and worst of humanity, as the world comes to an end. "'Train to Busan': Best zombie scare ever. This is coming from someone who can't even watch 'The Walking Dead'," wrote one fan on Twitter, referencing the popular US drama series. Some even proclaimed it the "best zombie movie" they have ever seen. Fans like 24-year-old Oh Won-heo hope the movie will propel home-grown horror films to an international audience. "When people mention Asian horror, they think of Japan. But Korean horror tales are truly frightening and I hope 'Train to Busan' will make the world realise that our local movies are just as scary - or even better." However, he added: "For my sake, I hope Hollywood will not ruin it with a remake." On that point he may be out of luck - European and US film studios are already reported to be vying to make their own version.	Snakes on planes are old hat - it's zombies on trains you need to worry about this year.
Shiels, whose played for League of Ireland champions Dundalk last year, joins a club that plays in the tier below the MLS in North America. FC Edmonton are captained by former Linfield defender Albert Watson. "Dean's a goalscorer and a creative player who works at a level we would expect of someone at FC Edmonton," said Edmonton head coach Colin Miller. "Dean did very well for my old club Rangers and has had a fantastic career." The 32-year-old, son of Derry City manager Kenny Shiels, spent four years at Rangers where he played in two promotion-winning teams. Previously he had spells with Hibernian, Doncaster Rovers and Kilmarnock. The attacking midfielder from Maghera won the last of his 14 Northern Ireland caps in 2012. FC Edmonton will begin their NASL season in early April.	Northern Ireland strike Dean Shiels has signed for Canadian North American Soccer League club FC Edmonton.
The former Nottingham Forest defender signed for struggling Longford AFC in January in a bid to end its season-long losing streak and 178-goal deficit. He was due to get his boots on for the Gloucestershire non-leaguers last month, but the match was called off. A club spokesman said with Pearce on side, it was hoping to get its "very first win of the season" on Saturday. Rooted to the bottom of the Gloucestershire Northern Senior League Division Two, Longford AFC has lost all its games this season and conceded nearly 200 goals - earning it the name of "the worst team in England". But following their star January signing, club treasurer Mike Dean said the squad had been training hard and "games haven't been as bad". "We went down to Bisham Abbey - the old England stomping ground - a couple of weeks ago with Stuart and were training down there for about two-and-a-half hours," he said. "We have been getting beat but the scores are only 1-0, 2-0 - very low now.  So things are getting better and the confidence is in the side." On Saturday, 53-year-old Pearce - nicknamed Psycho - will be turning out for Langford AFC in a bottom of the league clash with Wotton Rovers. Simon Graham, Wotton Rovers manager, said it was "chuffed" but their right winger was a "little bit nervous" about marking an "ex-England superstar". "We've got a young squad and Stuart Pearce's legs aren't as fresh as they used to be so we'll run some rings around him," he said. Pearce, who won 78 England caps, was part of Sir Bobby Robson's squad that reached the last four of the World Cup in Italy in 1990, and the Terry Venables-led side that was eliminated at the same stage of Euro '96. He retired from playing six years after that, having enjoyed spells at Newcastle United, Manchester City, West Ham, Coventry and non-league Wealdstone, as well as captaining Forest under the management of Brian Clough.	England football legend Stuart Pearce is set to finally make his debut for a team dubbed "the worst in the UK".
The firm admitted releasing a quantity of benzole, exposing five workers to risk of death from flammable vapours coming off it, in June 2011. A Health and Safety Executive (HSE) investigation showed it failed to take appropriate safety measures. Tata Steel was fined £930,000 and ordered to pay costs of £70,000, at a hearing at Hull Crown Court. At a previous hearing, the company pleaded guilty to breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. More stories from around East Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire The HSE said two of the workers involved in the incident were exposed to the chemical and suffered coughing and breathing difficulties. They were sent to hospital and discharged the next day. It said the release of benzole could have caused serious injury or death had it been ignited. HSE inspector Stephen Hargreaves said: "It was extremely fortunate no one was seriously affected by this incident. Had the flammable vapour cloud ignited this could have resulted in multiple fatalities. "This incident highlights the need for all duty holders to implement and address all concerns and potential risks which have been identified. "Tata's failure to do so in this case put a number of workers at risk of serious harm."	Tata Steel has been ordered to pay £1m after it exposed five people to toxic substances at Scunthorpe Steel Works.
The 23 year-old stroked the GB boat to a fast start and they were ahead after 500m but European champions, Romania and New Zealand proved too strong. The Romanians came out on top, with the British eight comfortably holding off the challenge from the Netherlands The GB eight now prepare for the World Championships in Sarasota in September. There was no medal success for Enniskillen's Holly Nixon in the women's quadruple sculls. Nixon and her GB team mates Bethany Bryan, Alice Baatz and Mathilda Hodgkins-Byrne, were always off the pace and finished fifth in a race won by Poland.	Belfast's Rebecca Shorten won a bronze medal as part of the Great Britain women's eight at the final World Cup regatta of the season in Lucerne.
That scenario once seemed beyond the reach of clubs that were being weighed down by the heedless spending of the past and drastic changes in the financial landscape of the game. What has brought about this shift, though? And what does it mean to the individual clubs and the state of Scottish football itself? There are a number of questions to ask about how the debt has been shed and what the impact might be. In terms of bank debt, essentially all are free of long-term liabilities now that Aberdeen have reached a deal with Lloyds Bank. Dundee United and Kilmarnock reached similar agreements last season, while Motherwell and St Mirren have been operating at more or less break even for a number of years. That said, the former often need the financial support of major shareholder John Boyle at points in the season and have been operating at a loss. Celtic have no bank debt and their interim results for the financial year to 31 December showed a surplus in the bank, while, through long-term planning, St Johnstone, Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Hamilton Academical are all free of bank debt. Dundee received investment from a US consortium and are now managed carefully financially, as are Partick Thistle, while Ross County's progress has been enabled by the largesse of the owner Roy MacGregor. Essentially, because Lloyds Bank had already written off the debts and there was no prospect of clubs ever being able to pay it back in full. Clubs have been fortunate that when Lloyds took over HBoS in January 2009 it provided a window of opportunity for the new owners to review all the debt on the bank's books. Any that was declared bad could then be written off in the accounts. With Scottish football unable to generate rising income streams - indeed, the league is still currently operating without a title sponsor - clubs saddled with large debts were ultimately able only to service them. Kilmarnock, for instance, owed £9.4m, having invested in the building of the Park Hotel next to Rugby Park. Last season, with the hotel valued at around £2.5m, it was sold to a company owned by Billy Bowie, with the businessman then converting the balance of the bank debt into equity. As a result of the restructuring, chairman Michael Johnston's 87% stake was reduced to below 50% and he was joined on the club board by Bowie and three new investors: Jim Mann, David Moran and Russell Smith. Yes, the bank's debt is being bought by Willie and Elaine Donald, who own the Stonehaven-based engineering company, WM Donald. Whatever sum the bank receives towards the approximately £9m debt is more than they expected, since in accountancy terms it was written off five years ago. The Donalds will likely convert the debt to equity at some stage and join the Aberdeen board. By wiping out the bank debt, Aberdeen have a little more financial freedom and can direct more resources to investing in the football side of the business. To an extent. The club will still have to operate at break even, since banks are no longer lending to clubs. They have to live within their means now that sources of credit have reduced or, as with the case of some clubs, disappeared completely. There will be more money available to Aberdeen since they will not have to service the debt any more, but it will not mean a drastic increase in available finance. Manager Derek McInnes won't be about to embark upon a spending spree. Dundee United will feel less constrained now, since selling assets was part of their agreed strategy with the bank to meet repayments. There is no essential need to accept offers for young players each summer, so the club can hold out for higher fees. The bank will have protected itself to an extent so that the debt reduction deal wasn't agreed only for the club to suddenly sell a batch of players and raise millions of pounds; percentages of future transfer fees will, until the end of next August, still go to the bank. Similarly, other clubs will not suddenly be able to sell their stadium having just agreed to a debt reduction deal. The bank was in a position to do these deals out of necessity but also desire, since there is no wish to be involved in football any more. There are also community and social benefits to striking the deals. It is too early to tell, but the best case scenario is that clubs are no longer on the brink of financial collapse. Also, there should be more leeway to try to hold on to their better young talents, although there must always be a recognition that English clubs will lure them south eventually. It is also often good for the players' career to move to a higher level, but they can move too early and become lost in the reserve squads of clubs when staying for longer in Scottish football will help them develop and boost the game in Scotland.	Debt has become a rarity in Scottish football.
The Public Accounts Committee says there has been a "systemic failing" in support to young people leaving foster care or children's homes. Its chair Meg Hillier MP says young adults are "let down by the system that's supposed to support them". The government says it is committed to improving the lives of care leavers. The committee found outcomes for the 10,000 young people aged 16 or over who leave care each year are "poor and worsening". Its report says the quality and cost of support to care leavers "varies unacceptably" between local authorities. Ofsted has rated two-thirds of council care leaver services inadequate or requiring improvement, say the MPs. "The scale of variability in the quality and cost of support, and a lack of understanding of what causes this, show that this is a systemic issue, rather than a problem in just a few local authorities," says the report. Young people must leave local authority care by their 18th birthday "whereas 50% of all 22-year-olds still live at home" it notes. These children have often had difficult lives with 62% in care because of abuse or neglect, it adds. "Those leaving care may struggle to cope with the transition to adulthood and may experience social exclusion, unemployment, health problems, or end up in custody." Some 41% of 19-year-old care leavers were not in education, employment or training in 2014 compared with 15% of the age group as a whole, says the report. It welcomes government initiatives to improve the lives of care leavers and acknowledges more good practice is emerging but says there is more still to do. "It's time the government reviewed its care leavers' strategy to make sure these young people get the full support they need," said Ms Hillier. The Department for Education should take formal responsibility for improving the system, the MPs urge. In particular they believe the DfE should improve care leavers' access to apprenticeships and training, suitable accommodation and better advice. Town Hall bosses said 40% cuts to their budgets meant providing care leavers with adequate support was "becoming an increasing challenge" which councils could not handle alone. "We urgently need to see the whole system properly funded and joined up to ensure children and young people receive the support they need, when they need it," said Roy Perry, chairman of the Local Government Association's Children and Young People's Board. The Department for Education said its reforms would help care leavers make a successful transition to adulthood. These include giving every care leaver a personal adviser and allowing young people to continue to live with their foster families after 18, though councils complain funding for the latter is "significantly underestimated". A DfE spokesman said the government was also funding apprenticeship programmes for care leavers and encouraging Ofsted to focus more on care leaver support. "But we want to go further, which is why we've committed to update the cross-government Care Leavers Strategy to improve support for these young people," said the spokesman.	Too many of the most vulnerable young people in England are "cut adrift when they need help the most", says the head of a powerful committee of MPs.
The former Liverpool boss succeeded Ronny Deila 10 days ago and has already moved into his office at the club's Lennoxtown training ground. Rodgers, 43, revealed he invited captain Scott Brown, 30, to his London home for a discussion over dinner. "It was good to get his opinion on how things are and how it looks for him at the club," Rodgers told Celtic TV. "It was also good for me to introduce myself to him as the club captain and talk through my ideas and how I'd like to work. "He's been here a long time, so he's been here through good times and tough times." Brown's fellow Scotland international Charlie Mulgrew, 30, is out of contract at Celtic and revealed that Rodgers telephoned him to ask if he would stay for another season. "I've spoken to a number of the players on the phone also," said Rodgers. The Northern Irishman will have six weeks to prepare the Premiership champions for their first competitive outing, in the second qualifying round of the Champions League on 12 or 13 July. "I'm really looking forward to 20 June, the first day back in and getting to meet all the players and talk through how we want to go forward," Rodgers added. "That's when the hard work begins. It will be a long season, a hard season, but it will be really exciting. I can't wait to get started."	New Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers says he has been discussing his future plans with some of his senior players.
The Hollywood A-lister turned up unexpectedly at Sunrise of Sonning, a care home in Berkshire, on Sunday to treat resident Pat Adams. Staff had written to Clooney, who lives nearby, telling him a visit would make Pat's dreams comes true. "This was a classy gesture from a wonderful man," a Sunrise UK spokesman said. "She was absolutely thrilled to meet her great icon, and it was such a lovely surprise to see George greet her with flowers and a card." The spokesman said Clooney was holding the letter staff had sent to him when he rang the doorbell asking for Pat. He said staff regularly try to fulfil their residents' wishes as part of an ongoing programme, but added: "They didn't think they would be able to pull this one off." The care home's concierge, Linda Jones, posted on Facebook that she was in "utter shock" when she saw the Oscar-winning star arrive. She said that Pat "loves George Clooney and mentions everyday how she would love him to meet him". Clooney moved to Sonning, where he lives with his human rights lawyer wife Amal, in 2014.	George Clooney has surprised an 87-year-old fan with a bouquet of flowers for her birthday.
Every week BBC Radio 1 plays a countdown of the week's top songs, based on downloads and online streaming. In May, the programme will move from Sunday to Friday evenings. CBBC will also launch a TV version of the Official Chart Show, presented by Cel Spellman. The new programme will be broadcast live from the Radio 1 studios and presented by Greg James and will play the top 20 songs of the week.	The Official Chart Show is being moved from Sunday to Friday evenings, as part of a big shake-up of the music charts.
In an open letter, he said he loved Russia, calling it "a great democracy". Mr Depardieu had recently announced he would give up his French passport after the government criticised his decision to move abroad to avoid higher taxes. Moscow earlier said President Vladimir Putin had personally signed the decree granting the actor Russian citizenship. In December, Mr Putin had said he would be happy to welcome the actor in his new country. "If he'd like to have a Russian passport, consider it settled," Mr Putin said. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault had called Mr Depardieu's decision to leave the country "shabby". In the letter, broadcast on Thursday on Russian TV station Pervyi Kanal, Mr Depardieu said: "I filed a passport application and I am pleased that it was accepted. "I love your country, Russia - its people, its history, its writers. I love your culture, your intelligence." He said that he had spoken to French President Francois Hollande and told him Russia was "a great democracy, and not a country where the prime minister calls one of its citizens shabby". Under France's civil code, dual citizenship is permitted but it is unlawful to be stateless. A person must obtain another nationality before giving up French citizenship. Mr Depardieu's highly publicised tax row began last year after Mr Hollande said he would raise taxes to 75% for those earning more than 1m euros (Â£817,400). The actor accused the new socialist government of punishing "success, creation and talent", and announced in early December that he would move to Belgium. Although the Constitutional Council struck down the tax rise proposal on Sunday, Mr Depardieu said this did not change the situation "one bit". The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says the series of events would be amusingly eccentric, were it not also serious in its implications for France's international image. Mr Depardieu, described by Mr Putin as a successful businessman and friend, has developed close ties with Russia, which has a flat 13% personal income tax rate. He currently appears in an advertisement for Sovietsky Bank's credit card and is prominently featured on the bank's home page. In 2011, he played the lead role in the film Rasputin, a Franco-Russian production about the life of eccentric monk Grigory Rasputin. In addition, Mr Depardieu has also helped raise funds for a children's hospital in St Petersburg.	Actor Gerard Depardieu has hailed Russia's decision to grant him citizenship, following a tax row with the government in his native France.
It would also cut foreign aid in order to spend 2% of GDP on defence. The party said there was "not a cigarette paper" between the defence policies of the Conservatives, Labour and the Lib Dems. The Conservatives accused UKIP of "playing politics with the military... in an irresponsible way". The dedicated veterans' minister would be part of the Cabinet Office rather than the Ministry of Defence. They would ensure veterans get specialist support, UKIP leader Nigel Farage said. This would include priority access to social housing and a fast-track card for NHS mental health services. During a visit to the West Midlands, Mr Farage accused the Conservative Party of being guilty of "shocking double standards" over defence and foreign  aid. The Conservatives and Labour have not committed to matching the 2% Nato spending target, which was met during the last Parliament, beyond 2016. Mr Farage said: "No previous Conservative prime minister in history would have countenanced sanctioning continual rises in foreign aid giveaways while at the same time pursuing a programme of continual cuts in defence." This election issue includes foreign policy and the role of UK’s defence forces at home and abroad. Policy guide: Where the parties stand He said troops who had served more than 12 years would, under UKIP, be offered jobs in the police force, prison service and the borders agency. Campaigners have long called for a national defence medal, awarded by the Queen, for everyone who serves in Britain's armed forces. Mr Farage said the medal could be worn by all veterans during parades, and would mean "millions of people would feel more engaged". UKIP say extra spending on defence would come through cutting the foreign aid budget by £9bn per year. Last year, the foreign aid budget was £11.7bn. A Conservative Party spokesman said the UK had the second largest defence budget in Nato and would spend over £160bn in the next decade on new military equipment. He added: "We've also enshrined the armed forces covenant into law so our troops are treated with the respect they deserve. "It comes down to this: you can only have strong armed forces if you have a strong economy first." Speaking to reporters during his visit to Dudley where the defence policy was set out, Mr Farage said UKIP's support had dipped since the "euphoric" feeling that followed the party's by-election wins in Rochester and Clacton last year. Everybody had "peaks and troughs", he said, adding that the by-election wins of Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless had caused a "slightly euphoric" feeling among UKIP supporters but the party is "back a bit since then." This week Prime Minister David Cameron urged UKIP supporters to "come home" to the Tories, saying the general election was not the time to register a protest vote. UKIP called his comments "absurd".

It comes in a shake-up of UK military buildings and resettling of regiments. Brecon and Radnorshire Conservative MP Chris Davies condemned the closure, saying there had been a barracks in Brecon since 1805, home to troops who fought the Zulus at Rorke's Drift. "This decision is abhorrent and I shall be fighting it every step of the way," he said. "The government has a great deal of questions to answer over why it is proposing to close a well-loved and historic barracks in a vitally important military town. "Brecon Barracks has served our country with distinction over its long history, with soldiers from the site fighting in every conflict since the early 19th century. "This decision shows a blatant lack of respect for that history." Mr Davies said he was launching a petition against the decision, saying the Brecon area had some of the highest unemployment levels in Wales. He also hoped the closure would not damage the town's "thriving" military tourism industry. Brecon barracks has about 85 civilian staff and 90 military but it is not thought jobs are at risk. Mr Davies said he understood the nearby Sennybridge training ground and infantry school at Dering Lines would not be affected. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon told the Commons on Monday the reorganisation in Wales would see a specialist light infantry centre created at St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan. Cawdor Barracks, Pembrokeshire - whose closure was previously announced in 2013 - will now shut in 2024, while a storage depot at Sennybridge will go in 2025. Responding for Labour, Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith, MP for Llanelli, said the ministry was "right to restructure its estate". But she warned closing bases would affect the livelihoods of many people who would face "gnawing uncertainty" over their future.	The Ministry of Defence is to close the British Army's Welsh headquarters at Brecon, Powys, in 2027.
Cryptography was once controlled by the state and deployed only for military and diplomatic ends. But in the 1970s, cryptographer Whitfield Diffie devised a system which took encryption keys away from the state and marked the start of the so-called "Crypto Wars". Whitfield Diffie and three other experts spoke to the BBC World Service Inquiry programme about the tensions at the heart of the spat between Apple and the FBI. In 1975, cryptographer Whitfield Diffie devised "public key cryptography", which revolutionised encryption. "The basic techniques we used until public key cryptography come from around 1500 in the western world, and were known from about 800 in the Middle East. "They are basically arithmetic. Not ordinary integer arithmetic, but something like clock arithmetic - it's 11 o'clock and you wait three hours and you get 2 o'clock - and table lookups. What's the 5th element in the table? What's the 20th element? "The trouble is you can't do them very well without some kind of mechanical computation. A human being can't do enough of those calculations to produce a secure system without making too many mistakes. "Before what we did, you could not have supported cryptography outside a fairly integrated organisation. If you look at the US Department of Defense, it's very large, but very centralised; everybody knows the chain of command. "They can have a trusted entity run by the National Security Agency (NSA) to manage the keys [used by the military and government]. If you were in the military, and it was part of your assignment to talk to somebody securely in another part of the military, they would supply you with a key, and every morning you come out and put one in your teletype machine or phone or whatever. "But the internet is not just meant for friends to talk to friends, it's for everybody to talk to everybody. Until you have public key cryptography you have no way of arranging the keys on demand at a moment's notice for these secure communications. "That's what browsers do with websites all the time. Amazon, eBay, all of the merchants on the internet encrypt at least some of the traffic you have with them, at the very least the payment portion of it. "[At the time] the NSA reacted like any other enterprise that has had a monopoly in a market for a long period of time. Suddenly somebody was treading on its turf, and it made several attempts to recapture its market." Susan Landau is professor of Cyber Security Policy at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. "Public-key cryptography was mathematically elegant and also quite elementary. That's what made it so powerful and so wonderful. "The NSA said 'Wait a minute: this work should be classified.' They had been accustomed to being the only place that cryptography was done. They didn't want a competitor developing algorithms that maybe they would have trouble breaking into. They wanted to hold the keys to the kingdom. "There was a big fight between the academic and industry research community and the NSA. But it was settled fairly amicably, fairly quickly. The next problem was who would control the development of cryptography standards for the US government. "The NSA does this for military and diplomatic communications, but there's a vast need for cryptography for civilian agencies such as health and human services, education, agriculture. The National Bureau of Standards had been doing this in the 1970s but in the 1980s the NSA began pushing in this direction. "Congress, who had always looked more favourably on the civilian side, put the National Institute of Standards and Technology in charge. "But the law also included this little thing about three people from NSA approving certain things. They exercised tremendous control, and kept blocking standards that were more friendly to the commercial sector. That battle went on between 1987 until the mid 1990s. It was quite ugly. "Another battle was over the clipper chip. Clipper was a very hard algorithm with a secure key, but the key was split and was to be shared with agencies of the federal government. The idea was [that] a business person travelling overseas would be able to use a clipper-enabled phone and talk securely with the office back at home. "But if you're doing something illegal the US government will be able to decrypt easily, because the keys are held by its agencies. "It was a complete flop. Outside the US, no one wanted it. Inside the US, no one bought it. It was a total failure. "The controls on cryptography in the 1990s were very odd because they were controls on an export. If you wanted to export a computer or communications device with cryptography, you needed an export licence from the US government. "Much of the time you would get 'We're looking at it, we'll get back to you.' Of course, when you're selling high tech, you don't need a delay of two months, [so] you decide not to have strong encryption within the device - you put in something very weak that the US government will allow to go without a licence. The effect was to not have strong encryption domestically as well as abroad. "In 2000, the US government loosened the controls on export of devices with strong encryption; it looked as if the private sector won the battle." Alan Woodward is an expert in signals intelligence, intelligence gathered from communications, who has worked for the UK government in various roles. "Suppose you got intelligence that people appeared to be mobilising their military forces. You'd need to know whether that was a prelude to war, or just an exercise. One of the ways to do that was by analysing the signals and communications traffic going around on the other side. "In the early 2000s, it got harder. Previously they'd had the ability to decrypt things that were weakly encrypted. You could throw a super computer at the problem and try all the possible keys until you unlock the message. "You just physically couldn't do that for the number of encrypted messages that were starting to pile up. But also, the forms of encryption were becoming stronger. The encryption that was being used by governments themselves back in the 1970s was called the Data Encryption Standard. With a modern PC, you can break that in a matter of seconds. That kind of evolution in encryption and decryption has been going on ever since. "It got worse because there were various other forms of technology that were based on encryption, where you were able to remain anonymous, completely hidden. There's a thing called the Tor network which causes security agencies a great deal of trouble, because you don't even know where that person is based, never mind who they're communicating with. "Governments recognised that there wasn't a lot you could do about this technically or from a policy perspective. It's out there. So what you have to do is  be able to get at it before it is encrypted or after it's decrypted. "They recognised that they needed to work more closely with the technology providers because they were the ones that owned the infrastructure that was being used.  They were the ones running it; it was no longer governments and state telecommunications companies. "They had very good relationships. Microsoft produced a suite of software called Cofee (Computer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor), which is only given to government and Law Enforcement Agencies. It's a forensic tool that allows you to analyse Windows systems. "You used to be able to go along to Apple and they could unlock the phone. With messaging services it was possible for governments with the right authorisation to go along and sit in the middle of the conversation and look at the messages in a non-encrypted form. "All of that changed when Edward Snowden got his leaks out." Jeff Larson is a reporter at New York investigative newsroom ProPublica. It worked with the Guardian newspaper on the sensitive material leaked by Edward Snowden from the US National Security Agency in 2013. "I had seen something in the Snowden tranche of documents that made me suspicious that the NSA and GCHQ had been working behind the scenes to crack encryption that powers internet technologies. "When you log into your bank or Twitter or Facebook, your web browser talks to those servers over what's known as TLS, which is an encryption layer that protects the confidentiality of that traffic. "The intelligence agencies - not only NSA and GCHQ, but Canada and Australia and New Zealand- had spent 10 years and untold billions of dollars trying to break these fundamental encryption technologies. "They honed things, like their power with super computers, but they were also able to mount a programme of inserting back doors into cryptographic software, and - perhaps a bit more troubling - the NSA launched a covert campaign to influence the very standards that programmers rely on to create encryption. "So standards bodies write up 'here's how encryption works, here's how you implement it in your software', and the NSA was actually working against that effort. "Ever since [the Snowden revelations were published in] 2013, there's been quite a movement to further encrypt the internet. "I think there's been an awakening on the part of private companies that it is important to their users to keep [their data] confidential and secret. "Apple saw these revelations about the overreach of intelligence services and law enforcement services, and created a phone that was harder to crack because they wanted to increase the security of their users. I do believe that. "The Apple case is very hard. I see the arguments on both sides. I see the fact that the FBI wants access to this information, and I also see Apple's need to protect its customers' privacy. "I hope that we come to a conclusion that is more open and transparent. What I would say is I like that this fight is happening in public so that we can have debates like this." The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 12:05 GMT.

The clash between Apple and the FBI over whether the company should provide access to encrypted data on a locked iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers highlights debates about privacy and data security which have raged for decades.
The FTSE 250 company said this was due to customers switching less between savings and current accounts because of low interest rates. The news overshadowed the 16% rise in annual profits to Â£73.5m that the company reported for 2016. Another big faller in the FTSE 250 was transport group Go-Ahead. Its shares dived nearly 14% after the company warned of lower-than-expected full-year profits, partly due to the disruption caused by strikes on Southern rail services. Go-Ahead owns a 65% stake in Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), which runs the Southern rail contract. Half-year profits at Go-Ahead fell 11.7% to Â£67m, and the company said its results had been "significantly impacted by a reduction in rail profitability due to losses from our GTR franchise, as a result of ongoing industrial action on Southern". The benchmark FTSE 100 index gained ground during the afternoon after spending the morning in the doldrums. At the close, it was up 10.44 points at 7,263.44. The biggest riser in the FTSE 100 was support services group Babcock, which rose 7.1% after issuing a positive trading update. On the currency markets, the pound dipped 0.13% against the US dollar to $1.2427 and was 0.4% lower against the euro at 1.1707 euros.	Shares in Moneysupermarket fell more than 6% after the comparison website warned that revenues so far this year were running below last year's levels.
Caitlin Ruddy had been with a group of teenagers on the north pier at Cullercoats Bay on Saturday evening. Northumbria Police said she was rescued from the side of the bay by a member of the public. Caitlin died in hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest. Her mother, Sabrina Cook, said she had lost her "everything". Mrs Cook has warned young people "not to take water for granted, because it is dangerous". "I've lost my daughter through it," she said. "She was stunning, she was my everything really, she was my friend." Caitlin's friends and family have been paying their respects at Cullercoats Bay, writing messages in the sand and leaving flowers. A RNLI lifeboat, a Coastguard search-and-rescue helicopter and police were called to the scene at about 20:00 GMT. Caitlin was taken to Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital in Cramlington. Another 15-year old girl, and a boy and girl both aged 14, were also taken to hospital as a precaution but were uninjured, police said. Ch Insp Paul Knox issued a warning that "people can be taken unawares by the strength of the waves" when it is dark and cold. "People should always be careful around water and if the sea is looking rough with waves pounding on to the pier, we would advise people to be particularly cautious and keep their distance," he said. A Cullercoats resident who witnessed the rescue operation said the weather had been "absolutely freezing". Newcastle University lecturer Clare Guilding said the beach was a popular place for teenagers to congregate. "It was minus 2C, but once you get out on the front it was just bitterly, bitterly cold," she said.	A 15-year-old girl has died despite being rescued after she was swept into the sea in North Tyneside.
Essex Police said two teenage boys and a man were taken to hospital after being stabbed in Colchester between 18:22 and 18:31 GMT on Saturday. As a result, the force's temporary deputy chief constable approved use of additional powers to search people. The "robust policing tactic" was used for three hours to "ensure order had been fully restored", the force said. A 17-year-old boy and an 18-year-old man from London were arrested, along with a 21-year-old man from Barking. Ch Insp Simon Anslow said none of those who were stabbed suffered life-threatening injuries. "This is a rare situation in any town and we are using the full range of legal tools at our disposal to keep the overwhelming majority of people safe, while making sure those intent on causing trouble will be swiftly picked up and dealt with," he said. "We will be pursuing a vigorous investigation to put all those we can find who are responsible for this detestable behaviour before the courts." The use of section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 gives officers the power to search people for dangerous objects and weapons without the need to have a reasonable suspicion. The powers were in force in Colchester town centre from 18:40 until 21:50 GMT on Saturday. Read more on this and other stories on the BBC Essex Live page Colchester MP Will Quince said he supported the force's use of the powers in this instance. "Their swift action in getting the section 60 order, which is a rarely used piece of legislation, means they can stop anybody without reasonable cause to check if they have a weapon within a certain time frame - I applaud the police for doing that," he said.	Police invoked special stop and search powers after three people were stabbed within 10 minutes in a town centre.
"The rules of the game are changing," the prime minister declared. And he launched a 12-point plan of tough measures to deal with the threat of terrorism. I can remember writing them all down in my notebook and wondering when this bewildering list of policies was going to end. Chaos ensued. Opposition parties protested they had not been consulted. The then Labour chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee dismissed the policies as "half-baked". And Mr Blair went on holiday leaving his Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, to pick up the pieces. Day after day, there were emergency news conferences as the policies were clarified, rewritten and embellished. Some were quietly forgotten - such as new powers to close mosques - and others provoked divisive parliamentary battles, such as allowing the police 90 days to detain terror suspects without charge. The attacks transformed the politics of the summer. But the key point is this: Mr Blair had already won his third election in May with a healthy majority of 66. In contrast, Theresa May is dealing with her terrorism while the election campaign is still going on. For the prime minister, there are several lessons she could take from the experience of her Labour predecessor. Anti-terror laws made up on the hoof in the heat of the moment are not always the best ones. And laws do not always help. Since 2000, there has also been a lot of counter-terrorism legislation passed by Parliament and yet the threat is still there and very real. Yet Mrs May clearly felt the need to say something in Downing Street in response to the London Bridge attack that went beyond the usual condemnation of the violence, sympathy for the victims and their families and praise for the security forces. The fact that she announced some policy prescriptions showed that, in her mind, the need to be seen to being doing something outweighed the inevitable criticism of politicising the reaction to the incident. And, of course, a four-point plan was better than Mr Blair's 12. This was a recognition by the prime minister that security is now a significant issue in this election. Long after the rows of this campaign are over the government that is elected will still be facing the threat of Islamist terrorism. Where once the last few days of the election might have been focused on Brexit or tax or spending, much time and space will now be devoted to police numbers, intelligence capacity and extremist ideology. It is a political truism that security issues tend to favour the incumbent, allowing the prime minister of the day to look and be prime ministerial. It lifts them temporarily from the petty partisan point-scoring to the Olympian heights of statesmanship and all that a Downing Street podium can confer upon them. In times of uncertainty, the status quo looks attractive. As Belloc rhymed, "Always keep a-hold of nurse for fear of finding something worse". Yet for Mrs May this is a double-edged sword. Her security background gives her the experience and knowledge to sound convincing and credible on counter-terrorism. Yet it also gives her opponents a record to attack and ask what on earth she has been doing as home secretary over the past seven years to tackle the threat. Has she, for example, been increasing or cutting police budgets? Security is also double-edged for Jeremy Corbyn. These attacks have allowed his opponents to revive past comments revealing his reluctance to use armed force, to accuse him of consorting with members of the IRA, and to remind voters of his opposition to many counter-terrorism laws. But the issue also allows the Labour leader to surprise voters with a counterintuitive promise to give the police full authority to use force. It also gives him space to question some of Britain's alliances with countries in the Middle East from where some Islamist ideology originated. The truth is that the impact of such incidents on elections is not straightforward. In Israel, for instance, what are considered to be terror attacks tend to favour parties of the right over parties of the left. But the evidence elsewhere appears inconsistent and sketchy. The terror attack in Paris this April did not help the Front National leader, Marine Le Pen. But in Spain in 2004, the attack on Madrid's commuter trains that killed 192 people - just three days before polling - did not help save the ruling centre-right Popular Party from defeat. The bottom line, perhaps, is that many voters in Britain will have seen terrorism before. And they will see it as just one issue among many on which they can base their vote. They also know that elections are about choosing a government for potentially five years and knee-jerk decisions are not always best for the long-term.	After the bomb attacks on London in July 2005, Tony Blair summoned the media to Downing Street for a news conference.
Highways England plans to "increase capacity and reduce congestion" between Worthing and Lancing. But Adur and Worthing councils say the Â£69m proposal is not fit for purpose and the government body should launch a fresh consultation with updated plans. Highways England project manager Tom Beasley said the improvements were the "best achievable option". Large-scale options were considered by Highways England, including dual carriageway schemes with flyovers. But the consultation focuses a mix of new traffic signalling and road widening on six junctions between Durrington Hill and the Lancing Manor roundabout. In a joint statement, the leader of Adur District Council, Neil Parkin, and the leader of Worthing Borough Council, Dan Humphreys, said the "modest" plans are not good enough. Mr Parkin said: "Highways England say they want to consult with us but we say this is a sham. By not allowing the public to weigh up options and see full costings how are we to make any kind of decision? "All I do know is the current scheme on the table is barely worth the disruption and certainly not worth spending Â£69m on." Mr Humphreys added: "Highways England do not seem to be taking us seriously. Our questions were met with an 'experts know best' response." But Mr Beasley said Highways England think that the proposal "would make a worthwhile improvement to people's journeys and is the best achievable option within the scope and budget available for the project". "We welcome all views and promise that we will take all responses to the consultation fully into account." Consultation into the proposal ends on 12 September.	A consultation into improvements on the A27 has been dubbed "a sham" by council leaders.
A 30ft (9m) decomposed whale washed up on the beach at Felixstowe on Sunday and the body of a minke whale was spotted near Orford on Saturday. Scientists from the Cetaceans Strandings Investigation Programme (CSIP) say there is now a third dead whale off the coast. They do not think the deaths are linked. The third whale floating off the Suffolk coast is thought to be a sperm whale, Rob Deaville, from CSIP, said. More on this and other news from Suffolk He believes the whale on the beach at Felixstowe is a fin whale and a large injury on its body is the result of it being struck by a vessel "some time ago, perhaps hundreds of miles away". CSIP - which attends cases of whales, porpoises and dolphins that become stranded on the UK coastline - is currently examining the Felixstowe whale. It is too decomposed to carry out a full post-mortem test but samples have been taken to assist with analysis in terms of whale population, Mr Deaville said. The Orford whale stranded on mud flats on the tidal River Ore will be "tricky to get to", Mr Deaville said. However, he does not believe the deaths are in any way related. "Three very different species, and in my opinion, they're not linked," he said. "It's a series of coincidental events. "We see hundreds of strandings a year, it just happens that these three are in close proximity." A spokeswoman for Suffolk Coastal and Waveney Councils said contractors were expected to remove the whale from the beach at Felixstowe on Wednesday. It is not yet known when the body of the Orford whale will be moved.	A third dead whale has been found by experts investigating the deaths of two others found along the Suffolk coast.
BBC Radio 5 live found football ticket-touting laws are being flouted, leaving fans vulnerable to online brokers. Some ticketing websites have deals with clubs but others could be "duping" customers on "an industrial scale". The FSF says supporters "would not mind paying an administration fee" to clubs to keep secondary ticket prices down. "Any company that gets between fans and a club will try to make a profit," Michael Brunskill, FSF spokesperson, which represents the rights of football supporters in England and Wales, told BBC Sport. "We understand fans might want to sell on tickets because they can't make it to a game, but our preference would be that clubs manage that." Arsenal are one club that already provides an in-house service where season ticket holders who cannot attend a game can resell tickets to members. The club says that 50,000 tickets were redistributed through their exchange last season, with 44,000 so far this season. The general resale of football tickets was banned in 1994 because of safety fears over the possibility of rival fans mingling together. Only outlets officially authorised by clubs can offer unwanted seats, with Everton and Tottenham having deals with one firm, Stubhub. Another website, Twickets, has a deal with Crystal Palace where tickets cannot be sold for more than face value. But overseas firms can avoid UK consumer law and the Society of Ticket Agents & Retailers warns the online trade allows unscrupulous firms to "dupe unsuspecting ticket buyers". Under UK law, tickets advertised must include the cost and location of seats in the stadium, but during its research 5 live Investigates found many examples where this did not happen or the tickets arrived late. The investigation also found that Premier League tickets with a face value of £23 were being be resold for as much as £130 each. In a bid to clamp down on illegal trading, Manchester United have seized more than 1,750 tickets during the past two seasons. One firm, Ticketbis, was found to have distributed season tickets and it was also claimed it was reselling tickets associated with people already banned from a stadium. When asked to respond to the allegations, Ticketbis, which is based in Spain, said it is a "secure online platform that works as an intermediary between individuals that want to buy and sell tickets in 40 countries". The company did not comment on the illegal sale of football tickets. Brunskill added: "It's important fans understand there are different types of secondary ticket companies. Some have no affiliation with football clubs, and are often based offshore so are not subject to UK law. "If anyone is planning to buy tickets, do your research because with these companies there is a danger that your tickets don't turn up. "There is a place in the market for the fair reselling of tickets and we would like clubs to use their own in-house systems."	Clubs could prevent fans being ripped off by creating their own secondary ticket exchanges, says the Football Supporters' Federation (FSF).
The world number one, 32, beat Waters 11-2 11-5 11-4 in just 24 minutes at the National Squash Centre to secure a first national title since 2012. "I am really happy that I played well all week to win the title again," she told the tournament website. In the men's event, Nick Matthew beat James Willstrop 11-2 6-11 11-3 11-3 to win his eighth British title. World number three Matthew, 35, lost his first set of the week but recovered to win the final in 50 minutes.	Laura Massaro won her third British title with a straight-set final victory over Alison Waters in Manchester.
Zaneta Krokova, 11, and Helina Kotlarova, 12, who were "holding hands" as they crossed the road, died after the crash on Ashton Road. Four men, aged 59, 48, 38 and 18, remain in custody on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. A fifth man, aged 23, has been de-arrested, police said. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said he was initially arrested for the same offence but was now assisting police with enquiries. Greater Manchester Police said it had identified the car involved in the collision as a Blue Peugeot 807. The dark blue vehicle, which had evidence of previous damage to its rear window, was found abandoned on Honeywell Lane. Nigel Whittle, principal of Oasis Academy, Oldham, said the school was "deeply saddened" by the news of the deaths of Zaneta, who was a first year student, and her cousin Helina Kotlarova, a former pupil. He said: "Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and friends at this extremely distressing and difficult time. "We are a very closely-knit school community.  As our students return following the Christmas break, I know that they will care for one another, and our staff will be available to offer the support and time necessary as we all come to terms with this awful loss." He said with the agreement of the Krokova family the school would join together to pay tribute to Zaneta in the coming weeks. A book of condolence would be opened on Thursday, he said.	Police have been given more time to question four men held over an apparent hit-and-run crash in Oldham on New Year's Eve in which two cousins died.
There has been damage to property but no injuries. Forecasters have indicated that it will be dry and bright for most of Scotland by Wednesday afternoon. Ferry services have been considerably disrupted and falling trees have caused some problems on roads and railways. Transport Minister Keith Brown chaired a meeting of the Scottish government's resilience team. Mr Brown said: "No-one is being complacent and whilst the weather alerts remain in place, the focused response will continue." A train travelling south from Aberdeen to Edinburgh suffered minor damage when it hit some fallen branches and a bus was hit in Aberdeen. In Edinburgh a tree landed on the side of a house in Redford Road. No-one was injured. High winds has also forced the closure of the Royal Botanic Garden in the capital. Aberdeen City Council said trees were down across the city, and the tree squad was working flat out. Huge quantities of foam blown in from the sea covered cars, buildings and a park beside Aberdeen beach at the Footdee area. Scottish Borders Council activated its emergency response team after warnings of extremely heavy rain, while Tayside Police warned of an increased risk of surface water on many routes and possible river flooding. Part of a building roof has come down blocking Bridge Street at Peterhead harbour and Grampian Police said minor roads across the region have been blocked by trees. High winds have seen restrictions on some of Scotland's bridges, while fallen trees are affecting some minor routes and ferry crossings. Historic Scotland has shut several of its sites across the country including: Fort George, Craigmillar Castle, Loch Leven castle, Inchcolm Abbey, Tantallon Castle, Seton Collegiate Church, Tolquhon Castle, Kisimul Castle, Spynie Palace, Elgin Cathedral and Inchmahone Priory. The National Trust for Scotland has closed: Brodie Castle, Newhailes, Pitmedden, Preston Mill, Fyffie castle, Haddo House, Castle Fraser, Leith Hall Gardens, Crathes Castle, Craigevar Castle, Drum Castle and Crarae Gardens.	Heavy rain and severe winds have caused power cuts and travel problems and swept sea foam into parts of Scotland.
The poster, on Tamworth Road, in Sawley, Derbyshire, shows aliens beaming up a person into their spaceship with the text, "they'll take the fat ones first". Combat Bullying, based in Nottinghamshire, said it would "further harm" those who are being bullied. Fit4Less said it wanted to create a "light-hearted and humorous" advert. It reads: "They're comingâ€¦ and when they arrive they'll take the FAT ones first!". It then has "save yourself!" with an arrow pointing to the gym's website. One passer-by said the poster was "ridiculous" and he would "rip it down" because "being a big lad myself, it upsets you". Many other people said it was "in poor taste" and "offensive". Natalie Harvey, founder of the charity, said the poster has caused her concerns because it would "aid bullying". "This week alone three cases have been brought to my attention of children being bullied because of weight issues," she said. "If those children or the perpetrators saw this poster it would cause further harm for the children who are being bullied. "The poster should be removed and replaced with something more tasteful to attract the gym goers." Kerry Matthews, from the gym in Long Eaton, Derbyshire, said: "We really didn't mean it offensively. "It was supposed to be a bit cheeky, hence the alien image, and grab people's attention in a couple of seconds. "So many campaigns use ultra skinny people and that's not the reality." Ms Matthews added that the gym wanted to get people talking about getting fitter.	An anti-bullying charity has called for a gym billboard poster to be removed for being "offensive".
The 40-year-old 14-time major champion twice had back surgery during 15 months out before returning in December, when he tied for 15th at the 17-man Hero World Challenge. Over the next five weeks he plays four full-field tournaments. "That is a concern, no doubt about it, but I'm also looking forward to it. I've sat out long enough," Woods said. "I've gone through some pretty tough lows. There were points when I didn't know whether I would swing a golf club again. "But I do feel good about it. I just need to get out there and do it and see what happens." Woods begins his 2017 season at the Farmers Insurance Open in San Diego, which begins on Thursday. He will then play at the Dubai Desert Classic from 2-5 February, followed by the Genesis Open at Riviera from 16-19 February and the Honda Classic in Palm Beach Gardens from 23-26 February. "I've got my body in a pretty good state where I feel I can handle that workload, but I've still got to go out there and do it," he added. "Feeling good about it and doing it are two totally different things." Media playback is not supported on this device	Tiger Woods admits he has concerns over the physical challenge of stepping up his return from long-term injury.
The 45-year-old, who had a spell as a player at Headingley between 1990 and 1995, spent eight years as Essex coach before leaving at the end of 2015. He replaces Richard Pyrah as Diamonds boss, with the latter to assist new Yorkshire head coach Andrew Gale. "The opportunity to work with an elite female team is really exciting for me," Grayson told the club website. Yorkshire Diamonds will start their 2017 Super League campaign with a Roses game against Lancashire Thunder on 11 August. The two sides won only one game each in the round-robin group stage of the inaugural competition last summer.	Yorkshire Diamonds have appointed Paul Grayson as their head coach on a deal until the end of 2019.
The environment department says what should be a carpet of blue at this time of year is now fringed with white. Commonly known as wild garlic, the alium was introduced as a garden plant but it escaped and is now rampant in woods and hedgerows. Plant expert Jane Gilmour from the Biological Records Centre is advising gardeners to get rid of the invader. Its leaves appear in the autumn which means the department can use contact weed killer to tackle the problem without harming the bluebell bulbs. Ms Gilmour said: "Sometimes called stinking onions, this is from the Mediterranean. It has increased massively in numbers in the past few years. "The milder weather and generally milder winters have suited it brilliantly and it is out-competing bluebells as it comes into leaf just a little bit earlier. "It is one of those plants people are staring to realise is a thug."	Bluebell woods in Guernsey are being invaded by a non-native species, environmentalists say.
The family had asked that half the remains be returned to them with the other half scattered in the grounds. Half were returned but the remainder had been wrongly used in an un-witnessed scattering earlier that day at  Weston Crematorium, Worle. The two workers lost their jobs and Dignity, which runs the crematorium, apologised for the family's distress. Instead of admitting their mistake, two members of staff, who have been described as "very experienced", tried to cover it up by using another person's ashes for the ceremony in front of the family. Eventually, they admitted what they had done to their manager, and Dignity - which runs the crematorium on behalf of North Somerset Council - started an "extensive" disciplinary hearing. In a statement Dignity said it was an "isolated incident" and would look at why "very experienced staff failed to follow our established procedures". "Following disciplinary hearings, two employees are no longer in our employment. The family and North Somerset Council have been kept fully informed throughout." A North Somerset Council spokesman said Dignity had kept it "fully informed during the process". "We are satisfied that they have investigated the matter thoroughly."	The ashes of a stranger were scattered in front of a family by two cemetery workers trying to cover up a mistake.
As first reported by The Express, the settled community in the Hovefields area of Wickford reported hardcore-laden lorries arrive at the weekend. The lorries were followed by large mobile homes. Basildon Council said it is aware of "an alleged breach of planning laws". Essex Police has also been informed. The Hovefield site - which is subject to a High Court injunction preventing further development - is less than three miles (5km) by road - from the Dale Farm traveller site in Wickford. Dale Farm was Europe's largest traveller site before about 80 families were evicted from unlawful plots in 2011. Jill Walsh, of the Hovefields Residents Association, said an English Traveller family in five caravans left the site on Friday. After they departed, she said, a number of large lorries carrying concrete, hardcore and three mobile homes drove down Hovefields Avenue and onto the five acre field at the end of the road. Mrs Walsh said because of the narrowness of the road one of their neighbours - an elderly couple - had their fence ripped out and shrubbery damaged so that the lorries could get through. "If the council does not prosecute over this and deal with the situation urgently they will have a Dale Farm II, but bigger." Phil Turner, leader of Basildon Council, said: "Basildon Council is aware of an alleged breach of planning laws in the Hovefields area. "We share the frustrations of residents, but the council does not have powers of arrest and must follow the proper legal process. "As a public body, we must act within the existing legal framework, as set out by Parliament, and this adds considerable time and cost in dealing with such situations. "However, residents can be assured that the council is taking all appropriate steps to deal with unauthorised development." Essex Police said it was investigating a criminal damage report involving the fence and has urged any witnesses to contact them. A police spokesman said: "Essex Police is aware of an unauthorised traveller development on land near Hovefields Avenue. "We are liaising with the local authority and will continue to monitor the situation."	Residents have called for urgent action amid claims that a new mass Traveller site is being created at the end of their road in Essex.
Attendances have fallen in recent years since the Premiership side moved from Edgeley Park in Stockport to AJ Bell Stadium in Barton in 2012. Sale have moved home games back to Friday nights for the upcoming season. "I think there is some rebuilding to do because I think people in the early days of moving have had a pretty poor experience," Cotton told BBC Sport. "That could be queuing up on a motorway, couldn't get away from the stadium, couldn't buy a drink at the ground. Listening to the things we're going to do to change that, if people come down from now they will find a very different experience. "The infrastructure is still well away from where it needs to be but there are plans to develop that." Cotton, 69, a former England and British and Irish Lions prop returned to Sale - a club he served as both a player and director - after Simon Orange's takeover of the Premiership side in June. He has promised to be active in his role, despite his commitments with his clothing business. "What I really want to see is a very strong north of England club that can compete at the highest level," he added. "That is my motivation for giving up the precious thing that I have got, and that is my time. "I think what was lacking before was that the board weren't very often represented at games home and away, and I think that is very wrong - board members will travel to away games and home games." One of the standout announcements from Sale's new 10-man board was that director of rugby Steve Diamond will have a seat on it. However, Cotton insists there will be no conflict of interest with a member of the coaching staff also working as a director. "It will put no strain whatsoever on the relationship, we're here to support him," Cotton continued. "We'll be working very closely with Diamond to make sure we can achieve the ambition which we all hold - if we went down we'd still be with them." Diamond also confirmed they are close to signing a new full-back and are still looking for another player to add to their backline, with former Bath and London Welsh winger Nick Scott on trial with the club.	New Sale Sharks chairman Fran Cotton has conceded they must work to restore their relationship with some fans.
The visitors led when Simon Makienok finished calmly for his second league goal this season from Greg Cunningham's pass just before the interval. Forest improved after the break and they levelled when Thomas Lam's volley went in via the post and Preston goalkeeper Chris Maxwell. Makienok and Alan Browne forced fine saves from Forest's Vladimir Stojkovic as the match finished level. Forest, who had been hammered 3-0 at rivals Derby on Sunday, started slowly and could have fallen behind in the opening minutes when Stojkovic saved brilliantly from Callum Robinson before later diverting Browne's strike from range onto the post. Nicklas Bendtner should have put the hosts in front when he fired over from Eric Lichaj's cross before Makienok scored just his second league goal of the season. Philippe Montanier changed formation at the break and Forest got the goal their improvement deserved when Lam's shot hit the post before bouncing off Maxwell's heel and into the net. Both teams had chances to win it, with Preston defender Alex Baptiste producing a brilliant goal-line clearance to deny Apostolos Vellios in the dying minutes. Nottingham Forest manager Philippe Montanier told BBC Radio Nottingham: "We deserved to lose the first half. The first half was awful, but we had a good reaction and a good game in the second half. "The players showed good determination at the beginning of the second half and after that we were confident." Preston manager Simon Grayson told BBC Radio Lancashire: "If you'd offered us a point before the start of the game, we'd have taken it because you expect Forest to have a reaction from the weekend's result. "But we knew that if we got after them early on we could put them on the back foot and we did that. "Overall I thought we had a very, very good first half. You just want to have that extra goal to go in 2-0 possibly at half-time based on how well we'd played. "Second half, you knew there was going to be a reaction and they changed their system and had a go at us so it's a bit frustrating that we've not won the game, but the way the second half went at times I'm delighted we got another point."

On Tuesday, First Minister Peter Robinson urged the prime minister to suspend the Northern Ireland Assembly. The crisis was sparked by the murder of an ex-IRA man and the Ulster Unionists' subsequent exit from the executive. Arlene Foster said the DUP was prepared to take "our own action" if the government did not intervene. "We will be taking unilateral action next Monday," the finance minister said. "We will give them space the rest of this week to come forward with their own solution, but if nothing happens between now and next week we will be taking our own action." The assembly is due to return from its summer recess next Monday, and Mrs Foster said it would "certainly be very different" after a turbulent month in Northern Ireland politics. After meeting with Secretary of State Theresa Villiers on Wednesday, Sinn Féin's Alex Maskey said the party again made clear its opposition to any assembly suspension. "Martin McGuinness made it very clear to the secretary of state that any suggestion that the  British government should suspend these institutions, Sinn Féin will be very, very hostile to that," he said. "Further to that we will not be in any way cooperating with the concept of self-suspension. "We believe that people out there want all the parties to ensure that these institutions succeed and more importantly that they deliver for the communities." Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt said it was up to the Northern Ireland parties to sort out the crisis. "I believe we can sort it out if there's political will and we certainly have the will to sort this out, because we don't want to collapse anything, we want to fix everything," he said. In August, police said they believed Provisional IRA members were involved in the murder of Mr McGuigan Sr. Chief Constable George Hamilton said the paramilitary organisation still has structures in place at a senior level but added there was no evidence that hierarchy had sanctioned the killing. That was rejected by Sinn Féin - it said the IRA had left the stage after ordering an end to its armed campaign in 2005. But the UUP leader Mike Nesbitt said Sinn Féin's denial that the IRA existed made it "impossible to do business with them" and has left the executive. Mrs Foster said her party would give the government time and would watch how "the matter will progress over the next few days". "We will see what happens - we're not going to pre-judge what happens from the government, but come Monday it will not be business as usual. "We will not engage in normal politics." Downing Street has said Prime Minister David Cameron recognises the gravity of the situation at Stormont and has asked Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers to hold "urgent" talks with the parties. Mrs Foster said she hoped discussions could begin immediately, and said she believed the talks would take the same format as last December's Stormont House Agreement negotiations. "There is no reason why talks can't take place next week or the following week. "There are two main issues - the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and dealing with paramilitary activities." But Alliance MLA Stephen Farry said the odds of any talks proving to be successful were slim. "If these talks do fail I'm afraid the assembly will be bust," he said. "The implications of failure are extremely high."	The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) will take action next week if the government does not provide a solution to the crisis at Stormont, it has said.
In 2013 a working group, set up by the Scottish government, recommended eligible couples should be offered up to three treatments. But that would only be after health boards had reduced IVF waiting times. Infertility Network UK said it was a "no-brainer" there should now be three cycles as waiting times have fallen. New IVF criteria was introduced in July 2013, following recommendations by the National Infertility Working Group. The changes were designed to standardise fertility treatment across Scotland to prevent a "postcode lottery". Giving evidence to Holyrood's health committee, the charity's chief executive Susan Seenan said: "The group recommended three cycles and said that once the waiting times were down to below 12 months, at the latest early 2015, they would consider moving to three cycles. "It just doesn't seem to be happening as fast as we would like it to. "We just think now that the waiting times are down, that it is a no-brainer - we should move to offering everybody who is eligible three cycles." Susan Seenan added: "Everybody in the group was agreed that...three cycles was the best possible way to move forward for patients. "Why anybody would not want to move forward with that, I have no idea, unless it is finance related." A spokeswoman for the Scottish government said Scotland was "leading the way" in the provision of NHS IVF treatment, with Â£12m of investment over the last three years. She said the number of IVF cycles that couples were entitled to was under review. The spokeswoman added: "The reconvened expert group has met twice and its review will consider a range of issues, including the number of IVF cycles, to ensure access to IVF treatments remains fair, reliable and timely. "The views of patients and our stakeholders, including Infertility Network Scotland who are part of the Infertility Group, will be instrumental to this process, along with data collection and modelling." Fertility treatment is currently available to those under 40, and is not offered to women who are obese. In addition, couples need to have been in a stable relationship for two years and neither partner can smoke for three months before treatment begins. Both partners also need to be methadone-free for a year before IVF starts. Women aged between 40 and 42 are eligible for one cycle of fertility treatment if they have never previously undergone the procedure.	A charity is calling for couples in Scotland who need help conceiving to have access to three cycles of IVF instead of two.
The Welsh national field of remembrance at Cardiff Castle features 10,000 wooden crosses remembering the fallen. Each one carries a message to someone who has died while serving their country since World War One. Royal British Legion members and First Minister Carwyn Jones were among those at the service. Mr Jones said he was "proud to be attending this event to honour those who have died in conflict." "As we mark the 100th anniversary of the First World War, there is an even greater opportunity for us to remember those who took part in the War, and the impact of the conflict in shaping modern Wales," he added. At 11:00 GMT there was a two minute silence during which Royal British Legion buglers played the Last Post trumpet call. National Chairman of The Royal British Legion, John Crisford, says the service shows the public's gratitude to those who "made the ultimate sacrifice in defence of our country".	A field of remembrance honouring members of the armed forces from the past 100 years is open at Cardiff Castle.
The 82-year-old, who has had health problems in recent years, reportedly does not wish to remain emperor if he has to reduce his official duties. But a palace spokesman denied that there is any official plan for the monarch to abdicate in what would be an unprecedented move in modern Japan. Crown Prince Naruhito, 56, is next in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne. An unnamed government source told Japan's Kyodo news agency that the emperor, who plays a largely ceremonial role but is respected deeply by many Japanese, has been contemplating the move for about a year. His family had accepted his decision, an unnamed palace source told NHK. However, both palace and government sources say the Imperial Household Law would have to revised to allow for the abdication to take place. A change to the Imperial Household Law, which stipulates the rules of succession, would require approval by Japan's parliament. Despite a categorical denial of the reports by imperial palace spokesman Shinichiro Yamamoto, the emperor's reported wishes are being given prominent attention in the Japanese media. Emperor Akihito has been admired for distancing the monarchy from its association with the aggressive nationalism of World War Two. In 1989 he succeeded his father, Hirohito, who had had the status of a living god in Japan until he was stripped of that role by the victorious Americans who wrote the country's post-war constitution. Emperor Akihito had surgery for prostate cancer in 2003 and a heart bypass operation four years ago. In 2011, he took the highly unusual step of making a televised national address following the devastating earthquake and tsunami at Fukushima. Five things about Japan's emperor:	Japan's Emperor Akihito has expressed his desire to abdicate in the next few years, public broadcaster NHK reports.

General Vladimir Padrino tweeted that the "leaders and masterminds of the paramilitary and terrorist assault" had been arrested. The suspects are a 38-year-old former captain, Juan Carlos Caguaripano Scott, and a lieutenant, Jefferson Garcia. Two of the rebels were killed and eight seized after the incident in Valencia. Venezuela has seen four months of violent anti-government protests, and almost 130 people have died in clashes. Just before the barracks attack, a video released on social media showed the uniformed men saying they were rising against the "murderous tyranny of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro". "This is not a coup but a civil and military action to re-establish constitutional order," said the leader, who gave his name as Juan Caguaripano. Venezuelan officials say Mr Caguaripano was discharged from the army in 2014. They claim he commanded around 20 uniformed men during the attack. He then escaped with Lieutenant Garcia and some stolen weaponry, they say. The 6 August incident raised tensions in the divided country, where critics of President Maduro say he is trying to cement a dictatorship. Mr Maduro insists his actions - which include creating a pro-government assembly with the power to rewrite Venezuela's constitution - are the only way to re-establish peace. The US has led a chorus of international alarm against the Maduro government in recent weeks, and has imposed sanctions on several high-ranking Venezuelans - including the president. President Donald Trump said on Friday that he had not ruled out "a possible military option if necessary" against Venezuela. Gen Padrino dismissed the claim as an act of "craziness". He told Venezuela's state television: "It is an act of supreme extremism. There is an extremist elite that rules the United States. "As a soldier, I stand with the Venezuelan armed forces, and with the people. I am sure that we will all be on the front lines of defending the interests and sovereignty of this beloved Venezuela." The White House said Mr Maduro had requested a phone call with his US counterpart on Friday. It said President Trump would speak to Venezuela's leader "as soon as democracy is restored in that country".	Two renegade officers who attacked a Venezuelan army base last weekend have been captured, the country's defence minister has said.
The US Geological Survey said the quake struck at 08:23 GMT, 420km (260 miles) north-west of the capital, Port Vila. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said the threat of tsunami waves had now mostly passed. The USGS said the quake was fairly shallow - at a depth of about 35km (21 miles) - but no damage had been reported so far. The quake, originally measured at 7.2, struck in the north of Vanuatu off Espiritu Santo. Quakes are fairly common in the region. Two similar sized tremors last October and December caused no damage. Vanuatu has a population of about 270,000, with some 44,000 living in Port Vila.	A 6.9 magnitude earthquake has struck off the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu.
A Calum Dyson double and first-half goal from Chris Clements saw the home side ease to their first win in five League Two games. The Mariners took the lead when a scramble in the penalty area resulted in Tom Bolarinwa's header being cleared off the line, but only to former Stag Clements who bundled the ball home. Sam Jones had a great chance to double the advantage after the break when Mansfield goalkeeper Jake Kean missed Clements' long ball forward, but Rhys Bennett got back just in time to block the midfielder's shot. But Grimsby got their second when Dyson took the ball out on the right before charging his way into the box and finishing superbly beyond Kean. Things went from bad to worse for the visitors when Evans was sent to the stands where he clashed with Blundell Park security staff. Hayden White then saw red after bringing Bolarinwa down in the box, with Dyson converting from the spot to secure the home side's victory.

A 9mm self-loading pistol, ammunition, four Enfield pistols and a rifle component were found at Albert Patterson's house in Hereford, the Hereford Times reported. The 65-year-old was jailed for 15 months at the city's Crown Court. He had already admitted three firearms offences, possessing prohibited ammunition and possessing ammunition without a certificate. More on this story and others from Herefordshire West Mercia Police said Patterson was arrested in January last year and charged in December. Two charges of possessing a prohibited weapon and a second charge of possessing ammunition without a certificate will remain on file following Wednesday's hearing. Former SAS soldier Lofty Wiseman who helped train Patterson, described him as a "good lad" who had been naive. "He broke the law unfortunately. He had to get punished," he said. "If he wanted a weapon as a keepsake, you could have had it de-activated, but by having a weapon, a serviceable weapon and ammunition, I think it's the ammunition that's really been the nail in the coffin. "If you have a weapon in a house with ammunition, there's always that temptation... you can never say you're going to use it but different circumstances, state of mind, if it's there, it can be used so that's where you must have laws."	A former SAS soldier has been jailed for possessing weapons and ammunition.
After weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered. Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third. Extend, yes, but for just one more year. Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge. Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to? Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote? Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two? The third, it appears, was the clincher. When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to "taking an egg out of omelette"), was a remote one. But that all changed on 23 June. Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor. If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations. Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve? That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets. And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he "wanted to serve" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years. But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a "third way" - the short extension. The reasons were personal and unique. In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs. Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system. He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week. "To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision," he said about whether he would extend his stay. "No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that. "Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors." Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of "tension" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision. Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add. Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations. But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year. By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete. It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain's economic future.	Sometimes, the simplest explanation is the right one.
Dartmoor Hill Pony Association (DHPA) said it had put forward the idea "reluctantly". The group claims numbers have dropped from about 30,000 at the beginning of the century to just 1,500 in 2011. The DHPA said if numbers continued to fall, the breed could lose its hardiness to survive on the moor. It said demand had dropped for the ponies as pets because of the economic downturn. The ponies were traditionally used for farming, postal deliveries and pulling carts. Charlotte Faulkner, founder of the DHPA, said in a letter to South West Equine Protection (Swep): "It has taken years of considering reports and listening to the outcome of meetings to recognise and reluctantly accept that Dartmoor pony herders will only carry on keeping their herds if they have a sustainable market for them. "We are in real danger of ponies disappearing from Dartmoor altogether." Ms Faulkner said selling ponies for riding and driving would continue. "The Dartmoor Hill Pony Association believes the meat trade should be (used) too," she said. "Strangely, having a meat trade should improve a pony's chances of finding a new home at sale." Becky Treeby, of Swep, said: "Dartmoor hill ponies were there for a reason, for ecology purposes to keep grass on the moors down, and they have been there for thousands of years. People have never eaten them before. It is promoting over-breeding for profit." You can see more on this story on Inside Out SW on BBC One, Monday 29 September, at 19:30 BST. Correction 2 December 2014: This story has been amended to clarify that it refers to Dartmoor Hill ponies rather than Dartmoor ponies.	Dartmoor Hill ponies should be bred for human consumption to ensure their survival on the moor, says a pony group.

Tory MP David Davis said news of the proposed in-work benefits ban could encourage workers to head to the UK. Sir Eric Pickles, a Eurosceptic who supports Mr Cameron's reform proposals, said action had to be taken to prevent a "new influx" of migrants. The ban has to be agreed by all EU nations at a summit on 18 February. It will be graduated, so that the longer migrant workers stay in the UK, the more in-work benefits, such as tax credits, they will be entitled to, in order to top-up their wages. EU referendum: PM faces grassroots anger over EU vote Mr Cameron says the move will "make a difference" to high levels of immigration by reducing a "pull factor". But it will have to be agreed by member states, as part of a wider package of reforms to Britain's relationship with the EU, and will only apply for a temporary period as an "emergency brake". If Mr Cameron can get a deal on his reform package in two weeks' time at the Brussels summit he is expected to call a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU in June. David Davis, a former Tory leadership contender and leading Eurosceptic, said eastern European newspapers had carried numerous stories about the plan to terminate in-work benefits for the first four years after a migrant's arrival in the UK. At the same time, he said, Brussels has suggested the scheme could take 12 months to implement. "Under such circumstances the incentive for anybody wishing to come to live in the UK will be to come as quickly as possible to beat the deadline when any such restrictions come into effect," he said. "Accordingly we are likely to see a surge in migrants in the next 12 months." Mr Cameron has suggested the "emergency brake" could come into effect within three months of the UK applying for it. Eric Pickles defended Mr Cameron's reform deal, on the BBC's Sunday Politics, saying: "What we need to be clear is, we're not trying to prevent people moving inside the European Union." The reforms were instead aimed at preventing people gaining "something for nothing" by claiming UK benefits before contributing anything in tax. But Sir Eric. a Conservative former cabinet minister, said action was needed to prevent a surge of migrants: "Clearly as part of the negotiations we have to ensure that that doesn't happen." Meanwhile, speculation is continuing about whether a big cabinet name will lead the campaign to take Britain out of the EU. The Mail on Sunday said Boris Johnson, who has previously said Britain could prosper outside the EU and suggested Mr Cameron's deal needed more work, has told a fellow Tory MP he had "never been an 'outer'". Bernard Jenkin, a leading member of Vote Leave, told the newspaper: "He is genuinely torn but I hope he will change his mind because he is one of the few who understands that if we stay in, Britain will be in a weaker position than ever before." Other potential Tory "outers" include Justice Secretary Michael Gove and Employment Minister Priti Patel, who have said they will make their position clear when they have seen the final deal. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who according to the Mail on Sunday has described the deal to friends as a "load of rubbish" which would be challenged in the European courts, is also refusing to comment publicly until the deal is finalised. UKIP MP Douglas Carswell told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme it "would be wonderful" to have a Eurosceptic cabinet minister fronting the exit campaign but it would welcome anyone who wants to join it. He refused to enter into the war of words between the rival groups vying to be designated as the official Leave campaign, but ruled out a merger between them saying they had fundamental differences. He said Leave.EU, which is backed by UKIP donor Arron Banks, wanted to focus on "identity and immigration," while Vote Leave, which he supports, wants to put forward an "optimistic, upbeat internationalist message". A third group, Grassroots Out (GO), which was founded by two Conservative MPs and is backed by UKIP leader Nigel Farage and Mr Banks, has said it is exploring whether it has enough cross-party support to make a bid to be the official Leave campaign. One of its founders, Peter Bone, told the Sunday Politics there were 42 different Eurosceptic groups working together under the cross-party GO "umbrella," and it was possible for them all to to operate as "one happy family".	David Cameron's EU benefit plans could cause a surge in migration before the "emergency brake" is applied, the PM has been warned.
Media playback is not supported on this device Paris Saint-Germain's £50 million defender David Luiz waved across the Parc des Princes pitch and then gestured with a thumbs up. Beaming with a bright smile I waved back immediately, then embarrassment set in. I realised the recognition wasn't for me, it was for another Ballymena man standing just to my left, the head groundsman at PSG. I was immensely proud for Jonathan Calderwood. A man raised just 'up the road' from me in Clough, County Antrim. This is a matchday ritual for Jonathan, receiving accolades from some of the world's most expensive footballers. "When we played Barcelona, I was told that Messi and Neymar both said it was the best pitch they've ever played on, when we played Real Madrid in September I got the same feedback from them," he said. It all started at east Belfast club Glentoran, where Jonathan cut his teeth (and grass) at the Oval. Next stop was the old Wembley Stadium in London, which coincided with his studies at Myrescough College, where he gained a National Diploma in Turf Science. Jonathan worked his way through the ranks, ending up as deputy head groundsman at Wembley. Calderwood went on to become head groundsman at Wolverhampton Wanderers before a move to Aston Villa. During 15 successful years at Villa Park he picked up multiple turf related awards including two Premier League Groundsman of the Year trophies. At Villa he met Gerard Houillier, one of the game's most respected managers. Meanwhile, across the English Channel a group of investors from Qatar made PSG one of Europe's richest football clubs. They wanted the very best of everything, including the blades of grass on the Parc des Princes pitch. On the advice of Houllier that meant a groundsman from Clough. He told PSG that Jonathan was the best groundsman in the world and Carlo Ancelotti, their manager at that time, agreed. Jonathan and his family moved to a new life in Paris and he made an immediate impact, becoming French Groundman of the Year in his first season. He added: "When you hear someone saying 'the guy just cuts grass' it's a little bit hurtful because I know what skills are involved, what dedication, what hours, what knowledge and experience goes into having a pitch like what we have at PSG. "Modern day football pitches are so complex and so complicated. I spent three years full-time at university and I would say 90% of my time was spent in the laboratory doing soil analysis, weeds, pesticides, disease management, wind, water, sunshine, fertiliser programmes and aeration - there is so much to it.' Jonathan's story doesn't end there, for his pitch will host Northern Ireland's game against Germany in Euro 2016. "If you're a groundsman like me, you want to work at the very top and it doesn't come much bigger than the European Championships," he said. "For me to move to Paris and for Northern Ireland to end up playing Germany in Paris on my pitch it doesn't get any better than that - it's like a dream come true." So Jonathan has already had recognition from some of the best players in the world - come 21 June he'll be hoping for a thumbs up from the likes of Steven Davis, Jonny Evans and manager Michael O'Neill. Who knows, that could be after a win over the world champions!	It was just minutes before kick-off, and that's when it happened.
The Victorian Society released its annual list, which it says names those in urgent need of help and protection. It includes Red Barns in Redcar where Bell lived, St Paul's Church in Chester, Wakefield's Clayton Hospital and Mount Street Hospital in Preston. A Grade II flour mill in Grimsby and a Cardiff railway station also feature. For more stories about Victorian England follow our Pinterest board For the first time no properties in London and the South-East have been mentioned. The charity's director, Christopher Costello, said it had "simply got far more nominations from other regions". "Retaining historic buildings like those in the top 10 is vital to maintaining local identity and creating places in which people want to invest, live and work," he said. This Grade II* listed building by arts and crafts architect Philip Webb has been left in a "terrible state" with internal water damage, the society said. It was the childhood home of explorer, writer and archaeologist Gertrude Bell, who travelled around the Middle East in the early 1890s. A Grade II former flour mill, warehouse and office complex which was partially converted to flats in the 1990s. The tower, which was not converted, suffered structural problems earlier this year forcing some people to move out temporarily as their homes were declared unsafe. Thought to have been designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the Grade II* station was home to the first steam-powered train service in Wales. A Grade II building that was partially funded by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie and once housed Clement Lindley Wragge's collection of ethnographic, zoological and geological material. Built as an orphanage, this Grade II Victorian Gothic building later became a convalescent home but has been empty for more than a decade. The stone Tudor-style hospital is threatened under a planning application by a foundation to demolish it for expansion purposes, the charity said. The society said the Grade II* church was "going through a closure process after the congregation merged with another church". A Grade II complex of Gothic sandstone buildings which was first a seminary and then a boarding school whose alumni are said to include comedians Tom O'Connor and Johnny Vegas. A Grade II listed former cotton mill, with boiler, engine house, chimney and weaving sheds which has been left derelict since the early 2000s and is currently for sale at Â£2.5m. This Grade II Shapland and Petter brick factory, showroom and office complex on the riverside was designed by William Clement Oliver.	The former home of explorer Gertrude Bell, a Grade II* listed church and two derelict hospitals are among 10 of the most endangered historic buildings.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Scot, 28, beat world number 87 Taro Daniel 6-1 6-3 6-1 in his first match since becoming a father last month. World number six Kei Nishikori brought the visitors level with a 6-3 7-5 7-6 (7-3) win over Dan Evans in Birmingham. Victory in the best-of-five first-round tie will secure a quarter-final place and World Group status in 2017. Dom Inglot and Jamie Murray are scheduled to take on Yoshihito Nishioka and Yasutaka Uchiyama in Saturday's doubles contest, although the line-ups can change up to an hour before the 14:00 GMT start time. "We will wait and see," GB captain Leon Smith told BBC Sport. "[It will be] hopefully our strongest team, put it that way." Britain are defending the title they regained last November for the first time in 79 years with victory against Belgium. "It was amazing," Murray said of the reception he received after needing only 90 minutes to see off Daniel. Media playback is not supported on this device There were signs of rustiness - four double faults and 25 unforced errors slowing his progress at times - but the Scot broke serve six times and saved both break points he faced in a one-sided win. Murray, 28, won the opening 11 points in his first match since losing to Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open final 33 days ago. He wrapped up the first set in 28 minutes and took hold of a more competitive second after a double fault at 3-3 from Daniel, the US-born 23-year-old with just five ATP wins to his name. Two blistering returns gave Murray the decisive break at the start of the third and he wrapped up the 28th Davis Cup singles win of his career in style. "The last few weeks have been the best of my life, really special," Murray said of becoming a father to Sophia. "It has been tough the last few days being away from her for the first time but it had to happen to some stage, and it is a pleasure to represent my country and be with team-mates that we won with last year. "The second set was tough - a lot of close games and some tough points, which was good for me. "I was getting a little out of breath but I played a good match, served well, missed a few second serves but the first serve went extremely well, so it was a nice start." Evans, from Solihull, had the support of his home crowd and the confidence from a victory in his only previous meeting with Nishikori, but the Japanese player was still too strong. It is over three years since he surprisingly lost to Evans at the US Open and Nishikori has since become established among the game's elite. Evans, 25, once again played above his ranking of 157 but could only convert four of 13 break points that came his way. After dropping serve twice in the first set he failed to capitalise on 0-40 early on in what proved to be a tight second. Both players missed break point chances and a tie-break loomed with the Briton serving at 6-5, but after saving two set points he then netted a volley and double faulted. With both men apparently tiring, the third set saw a rash of service breaks - six in eight games - with Evans unable to build on leads at 3-2 and 4-3. Nishikori, 26, was similarly vulnerable on his own serve but got himself across the line in the tie-break after two hours and 44 minutes. Andy Murray slipped fairly seamlessly back into the day job, but Kei Nishikori had to absorb a lot of pressure from Dan Evans to make sure the tie is level heading into Saturday's doubles. But who will play? Murray told me he "would love to play if it's the best thing for the team," as long as his body feels fine in the morning. But will Nishikori be on the other side of the court? It is looking likely - even though he has only ever played two Davis Cup doubles matches for Japan. "He missed a few balls and looked a bit rusty but overall you've got to give Andy a 9/10. He just wanted to feel the ball out there but he looked sharp, and will be looking forward to the big match against Nishikori on Sunday. "Nishikori got very nervous against Evans for a while there, but in the end the class player came through and upped his game."

Sightings of creepy clowns have sparked minor hysteria across the US since August. People in clown masks have reportedly chased others and tried to lure children into woods. Victoria police warned that such escapades would "not be tolerated". Creepy clown sightings leave US baffled 'Killer clowns' come to Canada Lurking clown arrested in Kentucky woods In a statement on its Facebook page, which appears to have since been deleted, the force wrote: "Victoria Police are aware of people who are parading in public wearing clown masks. "The clown purge appears to be a copycat of incidents being seen in the USA recently. "Any intimidating and threatening as well as anti-social behaviours will not be tolerated and will be investigated by Police." Clowns have also been spotted in Sydney, with one pictured loitering outside a fast food restaurant in the Campbelltown area. Australians have responded by setting up Facebook pages dedicated to "clown hunting", as the sightings spread. One theory has it that the upswing in "killer clown" antics is linked to the release of novelist Stephen King's new film, It. The plot involves a child-slaughtering being which takes the form of a clown called Pennywise to lure its prey. But King has criticised the craze. This week, he tweeted: "Hey, guys, time to cool the clown hysteria - most of em are good, cheer up the kiddies, make people laugh." The sinister craze began in South Carolina with reports that men dressed as clowns were trying to coax children into the woods with money. It was followed by sightings in Alabama, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Schools in Texas and Alabama have even shut down over the phenomenon. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told a press briefing that President Barack Obama had not been briefed on the issue, but added, "this is a situation that local law enforcement authorities take quite seriously". Reports suggest New Zealand has also been sucked into the epidemic, after a clown "lurking" at a school spooked parents on Wednesday. Some professional clowns fear the negative trend may put them in physical danger. Professional clown Jordan Jones, who goes by the name Snuggles, has started a #ClownLivesMatter movement, inspired by the #BlackLivesMatter campaign, to remind the public that real clowns want to spread happiness, not fear.	Australian police in Victoria have warned the public not to engage in "intimidating" behaviour after reports of clowns terrorising people in Melbourne.
Patrick Ewing, 66, collapsed at his home in Oakham, Rutland, and was given resuscitation by his partner, Yvonne Ainsworth. Paramedics used a defibrillator to shock Mr Ewing to restore his normal heart rhythm for almost an hour. East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) said only about 8% of patients survived a cardiac arrest outside hospital. Andy Swinburn, of EMAS, said: "Patrick's case is extremely rare. His heart muscle was very unstable, which lead to a repeated cardiac arrest meaning the crew had to shock him 17 times." Mr Ewing said: "It's an astonishing thing to tip over the edge and be hauled back again. "What they did for me might of just been part of their day job but they worked so hard to keep me going. I will forever be grateful."	Ambulance crews who gave a cardiac arrest patient 17 high-energy electric shocks say he is lucky to be alive.
"Bonkers Bruno Locked Up", was changed to "Sad Bruno in Mental Home" by the time later editions rolled off the presses. The revised words were still criticised by mental health charities. Eleven years on, after high-profile cases including Stan Collymore,Marcus Trescothick,Neil Lennon and Robert Enke, has the reporting of mental health issues in sport improved? A panel including cricketer Michael Yardy, whose depression became public knowledge after he left England's 2011 World Cup campaign, and the Professional Footballers' Association head of welfare Michael Bennett met at MediaCity UK in Salford to discuss how they would change reporting of mental health in sport. It may be tempting to look for indications of a sportsperson's mental health while they are under the spotlight in competition. But it is often when people are free to reflect, rather than when they are consumed by the action, that problems can arise. "After I left the World Cup, Geoffrey Boycott took my depression to be a reflection of my performances," explained Yardy. "But it is not always about performance. "There are times that I have performed brilliantly, driven home, gone to bed and not been right in myself. "I think I had my worst bouts of depression during the winter months when I have been away from cricket. "Sometimes it is actually nice to have the ball and bat in your hand and it is just you in that moment. "Conversely fielding can actually be quite difficult because if you have bowled a bad last over or something you can 'catastrophe' things." "There is an assumption in the media sometimes that something on the field of play has triggered these issues and it is not always the case," added Daily Telegraph columnist Jim White. A survey by mental health charity Mind earlier this year showed that 60% of people were encouraged to seek help for their own mental illness after learning about a sportsperson with similar problems. Coverage of a sportsperson's problems will have an effect on those consuming it just as it does on the star at the centre. "The way that these are issues are dealt with around big heroes in the sports pages is read, watched and listened to be people who suffer from depression themselves," said White. "If the analysis is that a sportsperson should have nothing to worry about, then you start to question the validity of your own problems. "The way we deal with it is not just to be sensitive to the suffer themselves, but the way it is presented to everyone else." When England batsman Jonathan Trott left the Ashes tour of Australia in November with what the ECB described as, a "long-standing stress-related condition", the end of Marcus Trescothick's international career came to mind. Wracked with depression, Trescothick dissolved into tears at Heathrow's duty-free in 2006, as he prepared to board a flight to Australia with his team-mates. But Trott later revealed that he was "emotionally and mentally spent" rather than depressed when he flew home. Former England captain Michael Vaughan said that he felt conned by the impression that Trescothick and Trott's cases were similar. "A lot of players come to talk to me about things and I'm happy to speak to them but I have my own issues and everyone is very different," said Yardy. "It is very dangerous to say that one case of depression is the same as another." "It is now very clear that Jonathan Trott was not in the same boat as Marcus Trescothick," Sky News Sports editor Nick Powell added. Stories about mental health issues tend to focus on the trauma suffered, rather than the triumph over the odds. "We never talk about positive mental health, it is always seen negatively," said Bennett. "We need to change that around so it is seen as a positive that someone is confident enough to come forward and share their issues." "People who have suffered with mental health are actually very strong in that they have kept it inside so long and continued on in spite of it," added Yardy. It is the white noise to which the serious business of the dressing room is played out to - joking and joshing, mockery and mirth. But does banter have to stop when it comes to mental illness? "In a strange way I embrace it, because the worse thing can be that people feel they can't have a joke with you," said Yardy. "People do take the mickey out of me, but in a closed environment and they know the boundaries. You obviously have to know somebody very well."	The Sun's original headline, above the 2003 story of former heavyweight champion Frank Bruno's admission to a psychiatric hospital, did not last long.
United Nations officials rarely use the words "genocide" and "ethnic cleansing," but they now say potentially both could envelop the world's youngest country. Since violence flared in Juba in July and spread to the previously peaceful southern Equatoria states of South Sudan, 340,000 people have fled the violence into neighbouring Uganda. That is more than any other country this year - the UN says 200,000 people have fled Syria in 2016. Every day, on average, another 2,500 South Sudanese become refugees, and the stories of what they escaped and what they saw on the way, add to the evidence of killing, rape and the targeting of civilians along ethnic lines. Nelson Ladu Thomas has twice walked over the small wooden bridge dividing South Sudan and Uganda at an unofficial border crossing known as Busia. A trickle of a stream divides these two countries and there are small bridges or fallen trees every couple of kilometres. The first time he crossed was with his immediate family; the second - a day later - was with his brother's wife and her five children who he had gone back to help. Six-year-old Moriswani was limping up the hill to the Ugandan police post where their possessions were inspected before being allowed on to a reception centre a little further up the road. I asked him what they had left behind. "They are killing people, sleeping with wives, stealing. They are not shooting you, they are cutting you with a knife. Even small children can be beaten down," Mr Thomas told me. The children gulped water and sat exhausted in the shade of a harsh sun. "They don't want us," he said, and gave his explanation of why his town of Yei, just 80km (50 miles) from the border, had become a place he had to leave. "These tribes of Dinka, they don't want Equatorians, they don't want… Nuer. They don't want them." Ethnic violence has dominated the crisis in South Sudan. The civil war began as a dispute between the Dinka President Salva Kiir, and former Vice-President Riek Machar who is Nuer. Equatorians only started to be targeted in July, when the violence spread to their part of the country after rebel troops fled the capital. In a long line of people at a nearby refugee reception centre, Otima Amos, 21, explained how he had crossed the border after walking through the bush for many days with 16 other people - most children, and among them two-year-old twins."We walked up to here - without any other form of transport," he said. "It was very hard because they were killing people. If you were a boy you would be killed, if you were a girl or a woman they would just rape you. If not, you would be killed." They were afraid they would be caught as they tried to escape. Uganda is coping extremely well with the huge influx of refugees. With the help of aid agencies, within 36 hours each family is allocated a 30m square patch of land and a tarpaulin to set up a shelter and start planting crops. Faida Sarah arrived in August with her children, but already has okra ready to harvest as well as onions, tomatoes and greens bursting out of the ground. The reason she left Yei was because one night soldiers came round to her home, demanded car keys from her husband and then hacked him to death just outside the house. In July Bidi Bidi was a village, but now it is one of the biggest refugee settlements in the world - home to more than a quarter of a million people and covering 250 square kilometres. But now home to nearly a million refugees, Uganda is beginning to struggle with its generous approach. "This has been unrelenting since July," said Nasir Abel Fernandes, the UNHCR's senior emergency coordinator in northern Uganda. "The international community has to pay attention, and pressure the South Sudanese leaders to stop this, as it's a massacre of civilians from both sides." He says supplying water to the refugees is a problem, as it has to be trucked in. As many as half the refugees are children, and schools are already running - exams were being marked and a presentation prepared for our visit. Girls sang and danced in a circle then Patricia Mercy, 16, stepped forward with confidence to deliver her poem. "War, war, war," she began, "who are you and where do you come from?" The confidence and resilience of her performance hiding deep trauma. "You have killed my mother and father, even my brothers and sisters, leaving me to be called an orphan."

One of the uprising's leaders said the soldiers were "ready to fight" if attacked. Sergeant Seydou Koné said they did not want to negotiate with anyone, according to Reuters news agency. The unrest began after a spokesman for the soldiers announced on Thursday that they had dropped their pay demands. In January, they forced the government into paying them about $8,000 (£6,200) each in bonuses to end a rebellion. They were due to receive a further payment this month and about 8,000 mutineers are unhappy that they were not consulted ahead of Thursday's televised announcement. Three former rebels from the country's civil war era were wounded on Saturday after the mutinous soldiers opened fire in Bouaké to stop them staging their own protest, Sergeant Koné said. There have also been reports of injuries after shooting in the northern city of Korhogo. The military chief of staff, General Sékou Touré, had threatened "severe disciplinary sanctions" on Friday if the uprising did not end. Shops are closed and soldiers are patrolling and firing in the air in Bouaké, residents said. The mutineers have also taken control of the city of Odienne, in the north, reports say. On Friday, shots were fired in the air at military bases in Abidjan, Bondoukou in the east, Bouaké in the centre, and Korhogo. It is believed the mutineers were firing blanks. In response, elite Republican Guard troops in Abidjan fired warning shots that pushed the mutineers back inside the military headquarters compound in Abidjan, Reuters reported. The situation in the city on Saturday was said to be calm. Reacting to the spreading unrest, President Alassane Ouattara held an emergency meeting of the country's security council. The mutiny has raised fears of a resurgence of the violence seen during Ivory Coast's 10-year civil war, which ended in 2011. Many of the mutineers in January were thought to be former rebels who joined the army after the conflict.	Angry soldiers have blocked off access to Bouaké, the second largest city in the Ivory Coast, as a revolt over a pay dispute continues.
John Stollery, 58, a social worker from Nottinghamshire, was one of 30 UK holidaymakers killed by a gunman near Sousse last year. His wife Cheryl said her husband was the most "fantastic man" and his legacy could bring about "peace" and "understanding". The terror attack on June 26 claimed the lives of 38 people. The attack in the resort of Port El Kantaoui was claimed by the so-called Islamic State. Mr Stollery worked at Nottinghamshire County Council for 33 years and for the last 16 years was a social worker, working with children in care. Mrs Stollery said she had been focussing on what good could come following her husband's death. She said: "Hopefully [the] legacy of John's of making somebody else's life brighter and fulfilling their dreams, might bring about some better understanding and hopefully some peace. "Acts of violence are not the answer. "He was the most fantastic man I could have met. He made a difference in so many ways to myself, Matthew our son, to the people that he worked with." Neil Duckmanton, Mr Stollery's best friend, said: "If there was anything he could do for anybody, he would, and he did that with me for 30 years." He will be remembered at a service at St Edmund's Church in Walesby, Nottinghamshire.	A victim of the Tunisia beach massacre is to be remembered in a church service one year on from the attack.
The 35-year-old joined the Iron from Blackpool in 2013 and has made 119 league appearances for the League One side. He helped them to a third-placed finish this season, before they were beaten by Millwall in the play-off semi-finals. Bishop told the club website: "With the way the season finished, it's a sense of unfinished business and it was disappointing for all of us."	Scunthorpe midfielder Neal Bishop has signed a one-year contract extension.
The High Court granted the adjournment after hearing a share purchase agreement was due to be completed, which meant HMRC would receive £1.4m. HMRC had applied to put the Formula 1 team, based in Enstone, Oxfordshire, in administration over unpaid tax. On Thursday, Renault confirmed it would take over Lotus. The adjournment was granted by Mr Justice Birss until 21 December, with the completion of the purchase agreement due on 16 December. He approved Lotus' application for the adjournment, which was backed by Renault Sport and not resisted, because the proposed deal was the result most likely to be of benefit to the creditors and the best chance of rescuing the business as a going concern. Other creditors, owed in excess of £2m, would be paid by 31 December, counsel Jeremy Bamford told the court. Renault first announced its intention to take over the cash-strapped team in September. HMRC brought the case against Lotus because of unpaid income tax and National Insurance contributions.	Lotus has been given a further two-week breathing space in insolvency proceedings brought by Revenue and Customs (HMRC).
Three fire engines were called to Railway Street, Tunstall, at about 2320 GMT on Tuesday. Crews brought the fire in the lounge under control within half an hour. The cause was believed to be accidental. The two people, who were suffering from smoke inhalation, were rescued from a first floor window. They were later discharged from hospital.	A man and a woman have been taken to hospital after being rescued from a house fire in Stoke-on-Trent.
2 December 2016 Last updated at 18:32 GMT We look back at the 22-year rule of the controversial and outspoken leader.	Gambia's Yahya Jammeh, who once said he would rule the country for "one billion years", has lost the presidential election to property magnate Adama Barrow.
Brian Buckle of Fishguard was convicted of child sex abuse in the 1990s, when his victim was aged between eight and 10-years-old. Swansea Crown Court sentenced him to a combined 33 years in prison, to be served over a 15 year period. He was found guilty of 16 counts of non-recent sexual abuse against a child. Dyfed-Powys Police Det Insp Richard Yelland said the sentence recognised "long-lasting harm" to the victim. He added: "This is the second case for the force, in recent weeks, where a significant custodial sentence has been passed down to a perpetrator of non-recent sexual offending."	A 45-year-old man from Pembrokeshire has been been jailed for historical sex offences against a child.
In experiments on mice, the stem cells were genetically engineered to produce and secrete toxins which kill brain tumours, without killing normal cells or themselves. Researchers said the next stage was to test the procedure in humans. A stem cell expert said this was "the future" of cancer treatment. The study, published in the journal Stem Cells, was the work of scientists from Massachusetts General Hospital and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. For many years, they had been researching a stem-cell-based therapy for cancer, which would kill only tumour cells and no others. They used genetic engineering to make stem cells that spewed out cancer-killing toxins, but, crucially, were also able to resist the effects of the poison they were producing. They also posed no risk to normal, healthy cells. In animal tests, the stem cells were surrounded in gel and placed at the site of the brain tumour after it had been removed. Their cancer cells then died as they had no defence against the toxins. Dr Khalid Shah, lead author and director of the molecular neurotherapy and imaging lab at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, said the results were very positive. "After doing all of the molecular analysis and imaging to track the inhibition of protein synthesis within brain tumours, we do see the toxins kill the cancer cells." He added: "Cancer-killing toxins have been used with great success in a variety of blood cancers, but they don't work as well in solid tumours because the cancers aren't as accessible and the toxins have a short half-life." But genetically engineering stem cells has changed all that, he said. "Now, we have toxin-resistant stem cells that can make and release cancer-killing drugs." Chris Mason, professor of regenerative medicine at University College London, said: "This is a clever study, which signals the beginning of the next wave of therapies. "It shows you can attack solid tumours by putting mini pharmacies inside the patient which deliver the toxic payload direct to the tumour. "Cells can do so much. This is the way the future is going to be." Nell Barrie, senior science information manager for Cancer Research UK, said it was an "ingenious approach". "We urgently need better treatments for brain tumours and this could help direct treatment to exactly where it's needed. "But so far the technique has only been tested in mice and on cancer cells in the lab, so much more work will need to be done before we'll know if it could help patients with brain tumours." She said this type of research could help boost survival rates and bring much-needed progress for brain cancers. Dr Shah now plans to test the technique using a number of different therapies on mice with glioblastoma, the most common brain tumour in human adults. He hopes the therapies could be used in clinical trials within the next five years.	Scientists from Harvard Medical School have discovered a way of turning stem cells into killing machines to fight brain cancer.
The Accounts Commission said there was a risk services could not be maintained without improvements in the way the council was run. But the report recognised that the council delivered good services at the moment. The authority needs to save Â£22.3m - 10% of its budget - by 2017/18. On top of that, council reserves are low and are projected to fall further, the report said. The Accounts Commission is the public spending watchdog for local government in Scotland. In its report, the commission said the council urgently needed "clearer priorities" in its transformation programme to ensure key projects were completed and savings made. The report recognised the council's "commitment to improvement", but added that it was concerned about the pace of those improvements. Deficiencies highlighted by the commission included financial control and management of resources. The chairman of the commission, Douglas Sinclair, said: "There is a gap between the council's ambition and seeing evidence of that on the ground. This is what East Dunbartonshire needs to address if it is to continue to deliver good quality services in the future."	A public spending watchdog has published "serious concerns" over the financial control of East Dunbartonshire Council.
The school's headmaster said the "growing expense and luxury" forced on parents was also a major concern. Beaulieu Convent School in Jersey also referred to "worries about alcohol and drug consumption" at the end of Year 11 event for pupils aged 15-16. A former pupil said the prom was an important milestone and accused the school of overreacting. Chris Beirne, headmaster, said the "significant focus and distraction" caused by the prom "does not fit into the ethos of our school". Writing to parents Mr Beirne cited a letter from an unnamed colleague who was convinced the preparations and the event were "not positive, constructive or healthy experiences". The colleague wrote: "The financial strain and the inevitable competition associated with this is another very unwelcome, and sometimes crushing, aspect for many parents." The letter from the colleague also referred to "alcohol and drug consumption at after-parties" as "a considerable concern". It said the strain of trying "to be slim, fashionable, have perfect skin" led to "unacceptable pressure". Mr Beirne said he could no longer "safely manage the risk" associated with the event. The independent Catholic school said it would continue to offer Year 13 leavers a celebratory mass with their families followed by a drinks reception at the school. The Â£5,400-a-year convent has around 760 students aged 4-18. Former pupil Hannah Hosegood, 20, said her prom was "a first taste of maturity" and the school should tackle individual pupils if they had concerns about drugs or alcohol. She said: "It's really upsetting knowing those girls won't be able to experience an event you spend a fair amount of time looking forward to and remember for the rest of your life."	A girls' school has scrapped its end of year prom claiming it is too much of a "distraction" to pupils.
Tomasz Galwaz, 29, died after falling from the roof of Al Amin Wholesale in Aston, Birmingham on 5 January 2015. Mafizur Rahman, 32, of Trinity Road, Aston, pleaded guilty to manslaughter at Birmingham Crown Court in December. Police said his main priority had been to get roof repairs done as cheaply as possible with disregard to the safety of workers. Al Amin Wholesale Limited, the company who own the buildings, also pleaded guilty to two breaches under the Health and Safety at Work Act. The firm was also fined Â£144,000 and ordered to pay costs of Â£44,600. See more stories from across Birmingham and the Black Country here Mr Galwaz and a friend were employed by Rahman in December 2014 to carry out repairs to the roof of the warehouse in Grosvenor Road, owned by his brothers and father, police said. The deal was carried out through an interpreter as the two Polish men spoke little English. Police were later told by the interpreter that there were no discussions around safety procedures, personal protective equipment or risk assessments. There was also no mention of insurance. The men were working on the roof on 5 January when it cracked and they both fell through on to a concrete floor. Mr Galwaz was taken to hospital with a serious head wound and died from his injuries the following day. The second man suffered minor injuries. Det Insp Jim Munro, from West Midlands Police, said: "Rahman's main priority was to get the job done as cheaply as possible with complete disregard for the safety of these workers âˆ’ with tragic consequences." A second man also arrested in January 2015 on suspicion of manslaughter was released without charge.	A businessman has been jailed for 30 months after a man plunged to his death from a warehouse roof.
Steven Souley, 26, and his accomplice Zico Malavin, 20, were remanded in custody after they admitted attacking Robert Eadie, 25, in Glasgow in 2014. The victim required surgery to repair a wound to his groin and penis after being hit with an axe and knife. Souley was previously jailed for seven years for killing a man in 2010. Sentence on both accused was deferred at the High Court in Glasgow after they admitted assaulting Mr Eadie to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement. The court heard that the attack happened at a Christmas party hosted by Mr Eadie's sister at her flat in the city's Summerston area. Souley and Malavin, who were not invited, turned up at about midnight. Souley was armed with an axe and Malavin - who was wearing a red Christmas jumper - was clutching a knife. Mr Eadie's sister, who knew the pair, demanded that they leave. Her brother was attacked after he tried to put them out of the flat. Souley and Malavin both fled the scene and police and paramedics were called. A knife and a Christmas sweater were later found at a property linked to Souley. It was months later that the pair were charged. The court heard that Mr Eadie needed an operation to repair a "deep wound" to his groin and to his penis. He also suffered injuries to his head and hand. He was released from hospital days later, but will be permanently scarred. Souley and Malavin, both from the city's Drumchapel area, will be sentenced next month. Souley was jailed in 2011 after being convicted of the culpable homicide of 41-year-old Andrew Curran. In May 2014 he was deemed safe enough to be freed early. Zico Malavin's brothers were both found guilty of murder over the attack on Mr Curran. Angus Malavin was jailed for 18 years and younger brother Zak for 17 years. Mr Curran died from a sword wound to the neck. The fatal park attack happened following a row over a bottle of Buckfast. A fourth Malavin brother, Kris, was jailed for seven years in 2014 after he tried to run down and kill a key witness in the murder trial.	A convicted killer has been sent back to jail after he admitted carrying out a brutal attack on Christmas Day, months after being freed early.
London's first Lumiere festival will feature illuminations and animations projected at 20 locations in the West End and Kings Cross over four nights. Julian Opie will be among more than two dozen artists taking part. The Durham version has been running since 2009 and attracted 175,000 people in 2013. Almost 180,000 turned out when producers Artichoke staged a Lumiere in Londonderry when it was UK City of Culture the same year. The London event will take place from 14-17 January. Mayor Boris Johnson said it would be "a dazzling new festival for the capital" that would "expel the post-Christmas blues". The first artists to be confirmed for London are: Artichoke director Helen Marriage said: "Lumiere was born in Durham and its incredible success has been recognised across the world. Lumiere London will be a very different event with its own artistic programme, but the principles remain the same." This year's Lumiere will take place in Durham from 12-15 November.	A major festival of light art is to be staged in London next year by the people who organise the biennial Lumiere festival in Durham.
The country has now seen two consecutive quarters of declining growth, the usual definition of recession. Its vital oil industry has been hit by weaker global prices, according to the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS). But the government says there has been strong growth in other sectors. Crude oil sales account for 70% of government income. The price of oil has fallen from highs of about $112 a barrel in 2014 to below $50 at the moment. Outside the oil industry, the figures show the fall in the Nigerian currency, the naira, has hurt the economy. It was allowed to float freely in June to help kick-start the economy, but critics argued it should have been done earlier. The government, however, has found some positive news in the figures. "There was growth in the agricultural and solid minerals sectors... the areas in which the federal government has placed particular priority," said presidential economic adviser Adeyemi Dipeolu. Nigeria, which vies with South Africa for the mantle of Africa's biggest economy, is also battling an inflation rate at an 11-year high of 17.1% in July. "A lot of Nigeria's current predicament could have been avoided," said Kevin Daly from Aberdeen Asset Management. "The country is so reliant on oil precisely because its leaders haven't diversified the economy. "More recently, they have tried, and failed, to prop up the naira, which has had a ruinous effect on the country's foreign exchange reserves and any reputation it might have had of being fiscally responsible." This economic recession comes as no surprise to millions of Nigerians. Many say they've never known it so tough. The slump in global oil prices has hit Nigeria hard. The government depends on oil sales for about 70% of its revenues. But critics say government policies made a bad situation even worse. The decision to delay devaluing Nigeria's currency meant many businesses struggled to get foreign currency to pay for imports, which had a cooling effect on the entire economy. Following enormous pressure, the government changed tack this summer, allowing the naira to float. That's led to a spike in inflation, but the hope is that it will attract foreign investors. The government also says the country needs to import less: it wants to see more products made in Nigeria.	Nigeria has slipped into recession, with the latest growth figures showing the economy contracted 2.06% between April and June.
Aberdeenshire-based Harbro Group saw pre-tax profit increase by £800,000, to £3.5m, in the year to the end of June 2016. This was despite turnover falling by £1m to just over £100m. Harbro said international sales grew over the year, both in Europe and in new markets further afield. The Turriff-based company manufactures and supplies feeds for the beef, sheep, dairy, pig and poultry sectors. It also has a network of 19 shops across Scotland, operating under the Country Store brand. The stores cater for farming and rural communities with a range of products, including fireside supplies, country clothing and footwear. In accounts filed with Companies House, the company said: "As always, the outlook for agriculture is difficult to predict. "We have certainly been experiencing challenging times over the last 12-18 months but the industry is a robust one. "The impact of Brexit is still to be fully understood, although the board are confident that the group will be well positioned for whatever business challenges this may bring about."	One of Scotland's largest animal feed producers has posted a rise in profits, despite reporting a "challenging" year for the industry.

PM Viktor Orban said Hungary would not allow migrants to leave its territory without registering. His comments came as Hungarian authorities opened the main rail station in Budapest to hundreds of migrants after a two-day stand-off. One train left, but then stopped near a migrant reception centre. Migrants mostly from Syria but also from Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan resisted efforts by police to get them off the train at Bicske, about 40km (25 miles) west of Budapest. Some were banging on the windows and shouting "Germany, Germany." Follow our live updates EU rules place responsibility for assessing asylum claims on the country where a migrant first arrives. Many of the migrants currently in Hungary have been refusing to register there, in order to continue their journeys to Germany before seeking asylum. Nothing illustrates how difficult this crisis is to resolve than what has happened to these several hundred refugees who are currently on this train at Bicske. They jumped on the train after waiting at Budapest station for three hours. They were really tightly crammed in - women and babies. They were told no international trains would leave. but eventually they were told this train would leave and they believed and hoped it would take them close enough to the Austrian border to get across. There were some police on board. We got as far as Bickse and when the train pulled in, there were loads of police waiting for them on the platform. The plan seemed to be to remove them, to take them to a centre where they would be properly identified. Some people left the first carriage, but almost immediately there was resistance, a lot of people were banging on the windows, some were shouting "Germany! Germany!" The police put on riot gear. And then there was one really distressing scene involving a woman who was carrying a baby by the railway tracks shouting "help! help!" There was a struggle involving one of her companions and riot police. This incensed some of the other refugees who had been taken off the train, they began pushing and jostling and there was a little bit of fighting with the riot police. And then they forced their way back on the train, which is where we are at the moment with police on the platform with several hundred refugees on the train in sweltering conditions. International services from Budapest's Keleti station were suspended indefinitely. There have been days of tension at the station. The number of migrants entering Europe has reached record levels this year. Germany expects to take in 800,000 asylum seekers this year - four times last year's total. The surge in numbers has created tension and disagreement over EU migration policy. Germany has been prepared to accept large numbers of asylum seekers, but other countries have not. Mr Orban, who heads the anti-immigration Fidesz party and was in Brussels for talks, said Hungarians and other Europeans were "full of fear" because "they see that the European leaders, among them the prime ministers, are not able to control the situation". During a tense press conference with European Parliament President Martin Schulz, the Hungarian leader said that "nobody would like to stay in Hungary, neither in Slovakia nor Poland nor Estonia. "All of them would like to go to Germany," he said. "Our job is only to register them." Mr Schulz countered: "What we are seeing for the time being is egoism instead of common European sense. "To say 'yeah, you know we have refugees all over in Europe but they all want to go to Germany and therefore we are not concerned' is effective, but wrong. And therefore I think we need a fair and just distribution." European Council president Donald Tusk said on Thursday that EU countries should accept at least 100,000 asylum seekers between them, a sharp increase on a previous European Commission target of 40,000. EU states instead so far committed to sharing some 32,000 asylum seekers from Italy and Greece. Mr Tusk also took Mr Orban to task for comments in which the Hungarian leader said his country was being "overrun" with refugees who threatened to undermine Europe's Christian roots. He said: "Referring to Christianity in a public debate on migration must mean in the first place the readiness to show solidarity and sacrifice." The human cost of the crisis was also put into sharp focus on Wednesday when five children were among 12 migrants who drowned in Turkish waters while trying to reach Greece. Images of the washed-up body of a three-year-old boy, who died alongside his mother and five-year-old brother, circulated widely on social media. Czech unease at migrant numbering Five obstacles to an EU migrants deal Those who risk everything for a better life The word migrant is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as "one who moves, either temporarily or permanently, from one place, area, or country of residence to another". A refugee is, according to the 1951 Refugee Convention, any person who "owing to a well-founded fear" of persecution is outside their country of nationality and "unable" or "unwilling" to seek the protection of that country. To gain the status, one has to go through the legal process of claiming asylum. The word migrant has traditionally been considered a neutral term, but some criticise the BBC and other media for using a word they say implies something voluntary, and should not be applied to people fleeing danger. Battle over words to describe migrants	Hungary's leader says the migrant crisis facing Europe is a "German problem" since Germany is where those arriving in the EU "would like to go".
A ruling will allow users and expert analysts to carry out repairs. But changes such as extracting and selling code would still breach copyright. Vehicle manufacturers opposed the move, saying repair garages could fix any issues. The ruling follows claims the right to modify software could have prevented the Volkswagen emissions scandal. The Library of Congress, which oversees the US Copyright Office, agreed with fair use advocates who argued that vehicle owners are entitled to modify their cars, which often involves altering software, Reuters reported. Manufacturers, including General Motors (GM) and Deere, spoke out in opposition. A GM representative referred to a statement from an industry group that said the new rules would weaken safety innovation. "Sensitive vehicle data could be easily manipulated, altered, or distributed - undetected - if these changes are implemented," the statement said. Deere spokesman Ken Golden said the company stands by its earlier opposition. But he added that some systems that transmit data from the vehicle to Deere could still be protected by copyright. Security researchers also pushed for copyright liability protection because computer programs are "pervasive" in modern machines and devices, including vehicles, home appliances and medical devices. "We are pleased that analysts will now be able to examine the software in the cars we drive without facing legal threats from car manufacturers," said Kit Walsh, a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which advocated for the rule changes. In the wake of the Volkswagen emissions deceit, the EFF said car manufacturers' software should not be protected from independent scrutiny. "When you entrust your health, safety, or privacy to a device, the law shouldn't punish you for trying to understand how that device works and whether it is trustworthy," Walsh blogged. The new rules must be renewed in three years, he said. Some US government agencies expressed serious reservations about the new rules, and the Environmental Protection Agency flatly opposed them. "EPA explained that vehicle modifications are often performed to increase engine power or boost fuel economy, but that these modifications increase vehicle emissions and thus violate the Clean Air Act," the Library of Congress said in its final rule. However, the new rules do not allow vehicle owners to break any other laws, the Library said, and will not take effect for a year so the EPA and other agencies have time to prepare.	Security researchers have been given the green light to hunt for flaws in car software by US authorities.
Brentford goalkeeper Daniel Bentley saved Aluko's initial shot but the winger followed up from close range to give Fulham a deserved half-time lead. The Bees did not register a single shot on goal in the first period. Ex-Brentford keeper David Button superbly saved Josh Clarke's effort before Cairney slotted in Fulham's second on the break in stoppage time. A win for Dean Smith's Bees would have taken them into the play-off places before Saturday's Championship fixtures, but they failed to find the net for the fourth time in six league games. Instead, they were leapfrogged by a Fulham side that is only outside the top six on goal difference. Fulham, who had scored 11 times in their previous four Championship matches, should have been further ahead by the interval. Full-backs Scott Malone and Ryan Fredericks were constant attacking threats but some wayward finishing let the visitors down, while Bentley rescued Brentford with saves from Stefan Johansen and Cairney. Brentford struggled to seriously test Button too often on his return to Griffin Park following his summer move to Craven Cottage. He made an excellent one-handed stop to deny Clarke an equaliser and Fulham survived a number of scrambles from set-pieces before Cairney's calmly-taken goal sealed victory. Brentford boss Dean Smith told BBC Radio London: "We didn't perform well and didn't deserve to win. We knew they would come and press us but our use of the ball was not good enough. "In the second half our midfielders had to get on the ball higher up the pitch and we were better. "While not playing at our best, we showed some spirit and stayed in the game until the 93rd minute." Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic told BBC Radio London: "I am very happy. We showed another positive step and our progress. We tried to show our identity and our style and I am very satisfied for my lads and the Fulham fans. "We didn't win in the last four games against Brentford and this is a nice present for people around us. "We are in a learning process and want to be better." Match ends, Brentford 0, Fulham 2.

Bomb disposal officers were sent to Birmingham's Lee Bank area on Friday and nearby roads were closed and cordoned off. The men, two aged 32 and 37 were arrested in Stoke-on-Trent and three others, aged 18, 24 and 28, were arrested in Birmingham. Magistrates granted police a further seven days to question the men. Detectives from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit appeared before London's Westminster Magistrates' Court via video link on Saturday to submit their request for a warrant of further detention, a spokesman said. The men were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. Ch Supt Sue Southern, from West Midlands Police, said: "The arrests of the five men were intelligence led and our investigation continues at full pace." A number of properties in the Stoke and Birmingham areas have been searched as part of the investigation. The BBC understands the force was dealing with two suspect devices that were found at a business in Lee Bank on Friday.	Police have been given more time to question five men arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences.
That steady stream of stories has led to the launch of a major public inquiry into their activities. The breadth and nature of what is being alleged is almost too big to grasp, but it fundamentally comes down to a simple question of whether elements of the police were out of control. So, here are seven key themes and allegations that lie in the road ahead - and some of the real practical and legal problems the inquiry faces. Some police officers had relationships with women whom they met within the protest movements they had been deployed to infiltrate. Last year, the Metropolitan Police paid one woman who had a child with an officer Â£425,000 in compensation. There are approximately a dozen civil claims for damages before the courts amid allegations that officers were expected to have relationships as part of their cover identity. But how many did so and under what circumstances? This is a huge challenge for the inquiry. How will it find out and inform the public if the undercover officer involved remains unknown, there are no records and, crucially, the partner never had any suspicions? During the 40-year history of the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) - the police unit at the heart of many of the allegations - officers used 106 "covert identities". According to a published police review, some 42 of them were almost certainly taken from children who had died - and the parents did not know about it. In 2013, a senior officer said the practice wasn't sanctioned by Scotland Yard - yet it seemed to have gone on for years. How many names were used? Who authorised it? Should the parents have known? If the names of the dead children are revealed, will that identify the officers the police want to protect? The undercover affair has so far led to more than 50 convictions being quashed after a failure to disclose that officers had infiltrated protest groups later accused of criminality. The two largest cases relate to environmental protests at power stations, both of which involved Mark Kennedy, an officer with the National Public Order Intelligence Unit. He would drive protesters around, effectively facilitating demonstrations later found to have broken the law. A review for the Home Office said there could be a possible further 83 miscarriages of justice - although its author, Mark Ellison QC, couldn't be sure there were not more. So will the inquiry look at allegations that officers lied in court? John Jordan was convicted over his role in a protest in 1996 - but was cleared on appeal in 2013 after it emerged that his co-defendant was Jim Boyling, an undercover officer. The officer even gave evidence in character. Jordan has been taking legal action for a full explanation of what happened. Peter Francis, the only former SDS officer speaking publicly, says that Scotland Yard kept intelligence files on MPs during the 1990s. During his time in Special Branch, he says he saw files on 10 Labour MPs which he and others would regularly update. So what did that monitoring amount to? Was the information on MPs incidental, gathered as part of watching campaign groups? Or did some Scotland Yard chiefs want deeper intelligence on the MPs? Separate allegations have emerged that undercover officers also gathered information on some trade union activists. The most toxic allegation so far has been that Scotland Yard had a "spy" in the Lawrence family camp. He later had a meeting with a senior officer helping to prepare Scotland Yard for the public inquiry into the London teenager's murder. The exact nature of what information was gathered, why it was gathered and how it was used remains unclear. The then Metropolitan Police Commissioner and now peer, Lord Condon, has said that had he known of the existence of such undercover action in relation to the Lawrences, he would have stopped it. Peter Francis spent four years deep undercover and he eventually became mentally ill, suffering post-traumatic stress disorder. Today, he says some of what he was asked to do was wrong - and he wants senior officers to account for the way they deployed officers like him. He is not the only officer to have had concerns about the ethics of their work. Phase two of the inquiry is expected to look at the "operational governance and oversight" of undercover operations, including how officers are selected, trained, managed and cared for. The most important acronym in this inquiry stands for Neither Confirm Nor Deny. It's a legal position adopted by the police and other security agencies in cases involving protection of undercover officers or sensitive sources. The first potential legal battle will come if police will refuse to admit whether or not they had officers deployed in specific circumstances. Official reports have already revealed the existence of some of these undercover officers - such as the one who was in a campaign group close to the Lawrence family - but they remain anonymous. If officers remain in the shadows because, quite simply, they were incredibly good at their job, police chiefs will almost certainly argue that the public interest lies in protecting their anonymity because of their legal duty of care.	The allegations of wrongdoing by undercover police officers that have emerged since 2011 have been extraordinary.
Tony Tinley responded to The Sunday Times report that the company may spend research budgets overseas if government support for innovation is cut. Mr Tinley said he wanted the firm to commit itself to the city. Rolls-Royce said it invests in research and development "where the environment is supportive". The union fears that grants offered by the department for Business, Innovation and Skills, to firms like Rolls-Royce, could be turned into loans as a result of spending cuts. Mr Tinley, a senior regional Unite officer in the East Midlands, said: "If you move [research and development], the manufacturing goes with it. "You could be arguing that the whole presence of Rolls-Royce is being put at risk. "I get called a scaremonger for this but when I've sat and looked in the eyes of these people [senior management], I don't see that commitment." Dr Ian Jackson, from Staffordshire University's business school, said turning grants into loans could have a serious effect on Rolls-Royce. He said: "It would put at risk the qualified scientists and engineers not just at Rolls-Royce in Derby, but also the supply chain, and wider into the hinterland of what supports that." Rolls-Royce, which employs about 13,000 people in Derby, said in a statement: "Rolls-Royce has always maintained that we invest in research and development where the environment is supportive. "The location of research and technology is dependent on where the early stages of innovation happens, and the UK today has a compelling and competitive environment for Rolls-Royce to invest." A government spokesperson said: "We want the UK to be the best place in Europe to innovate and grow a business. "We are simplifying support for business, boosting collaboration and investing in research infrastructure on a record scale."	Hundreds of jobs could be lost if Rolls-Royce moves it research and development work out of Derby, a Unite union organiser has said.
An independent report commissioned by the Department of Health estimated these groups cost the NHS £2bn a year. Ministers said some of that spending was unavoidable, but said it would be realistic to save a quarter. Savings would come from deterring so-called health tourism, recovering money owed by other countries and a levy on non-European temporary residents. One senior doctor questioned the government's figures and said doctors should not have to spend time "vetting eligibility" of patients. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he did not want to "turn GPs into border guards" and no-one would be denied emergency treatment, but foreign visitors must make a "fair contribution". Mr Hunt said he recognised the NHS's duty of care must "transcend" financial concerns, but collecting an extra £500m a year could pay for 4,000 extra doctors. "We have one of the most generous systems in the world when it comes to healthcare for foreign visitors, but it's time for action to ensure the NHS is a national health service - not an international one," he added. By Nick TriggleHealth correspondent The issue of which foreigners are entitled to treatment and which are not is complex. The first thing to say is if someone needs emergency care - for example if they have an accident - the NHS will treat them no matter where they come from. Another exemption is if someone has an infectious disease as treatment helps protect the wider public. Beyond that the UK has reciprocal agreements with most European countries and 28 other nations, including countries such as Canada and Australia. It means if their residents need care while here temporarily - either on holiday or working - they will be seen and the NHS will then reclaim the cost of that care from the other country. The research released by the Department of Health shows the NHS is not very good at clawing that money back. This is because of a perverse incentive in the system which ministers now want to rectify. Meanwhile, travelling to the UK deliberately for health treatment - so-called health tourism - is not allowed. The rules are less clear in other cases, such as expats and asylum seekers. The latest research is published in two separate reports by firms Prederi and Creative Research. The government has been criticised for using financial estimates from the Prederi report, but Mr Hunt said it was the "most thorough research there has ever been" in this area. The report itself notes that it is based on "incomplete data, sometimes of varying quality, and a large number of assumptions", but it says the estimates are the "best that can be made at present", and Mr Hunt said researchers had been "completely honest about what they do know and what they don't know". The government is currently consulting on the measures it will take to tackle this issue. It has already announced a £200-a-year levy on migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) staying for between six months and five years, and Mr Hunt said this could raise £200m a year. A cost-recovery unit will also be set up to help hospitals claw back money they are owed by other governments for treating foreign nationals visiting the UK. Meanwhile, "deliberate health tourism" - whereby people travel to the UK to get NHS care - is estimated by Prederi to cost between £60m and £80m a year. The report's authors concede this figure is "uncertain" and the "plausible range" of the cost is £20m-£100m. Frequent visitors "taking advantage" by registering with GPs and getting access to prescriptions and some hospital referrals cost the NHS a further £50m-£200m a year, the report adds. The government accepts it cannot recoup all of this money and entirely stop health tourism and so it has put forward the "conservative" £500m figure. To achieve this, it said a better system of identifying when visitors and migrants got treatment was needed. More details on what this will involve will be revealed in the coming weeks. Free NHS care is offered to anyone with living in the UK who has temporary or permanent permission to do so. Asylum seekers, non-EEA nationals who do not have permission to live in the UK, British ex-pats and visitors usually have to pay for treatment. The UK has reciprocal agreements with most European nations and 28 other countries, and under these visitors are given free NHS care. The NHS should claim these costs back from the relevant governments - but the research suggests just £73m a year is recouped out of more than £460m at present. This is because there is a perverse incentive in the system whereby if they declare the fact they have treated a foreign national it is up to the individual hospital to chase up the home nation for the money whereas if they do not declare it they get money from the NHS system for seeing a patient entitled to care. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: "We are not against improving the recovery of costs from people with no entitlement to NHS treatment." But he added the figures were based on a "large number of assumptions" and was more about "spin than substance". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs committee, said the government's £500m savings figure was "exaggerated", partly because it did not take account of the costs of implementing its plans. He said migrants paying the proposed £200-a-year levy could be more likely to use the NHS to "get their money's worth", and he said the cost of a single hospital outpatient appointment would be more than £200. Dr Nagpaul said doctors should not be distracted from their work in order to check the eligibility of patients for treatments. Dr Clare Gerada, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said it was imperative GPs were not tasked with being a "new border agency" in policing the NHS. "The risks to public health that will arise from these proposals are also very real. They will deter people from seeking medical help in the early stages of illness when they can be dealt with cost-effectively and efficiently in primary care, rather than requiring expensive specialist care and increasing admissions to emergency departments," she said. Jonathan Portes, of the Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank, said the research revealed the extent of deliberate health tourism had been "hugely overstated" and was in fact a "very small part of NHS expenditure".	Up to £500m could be recovered from overseas visitors and migrants using the NHS every year, ministers believe.
Media playback is not supported on this device The 40-year-old won Olympic heptathlon bronze for Britain in 2004 and has been upgraded to two more bronze medals from 2008 after retrospective drug tests. All world records set before 2005 could be rewritten under a new proposal from European Athletics, after the sport's latest doping scandal. Sotherton said tweaking events would create "a new slate" and new records. She said: "Could we go back to yards or run 101m instead of 100m? "We all know that some of the records are completely out there. But not all of those records were achieved by people who cheated. "Scrapping those records is unfair on those athletes. And what about my pre-2005 performances? Did they happen? Does this apply to national records too?" Sotherton referred to the IAAF's decision to remodel the men's javelin in 1986. Changes were made to the javelin's design because of increasingly frequent flat landings. All existing records were reset after the change, but not erased. "I am open to the discussion - for the greater good of the sport it's a good thing," she added.	Kelly Sotherton says athletics chiefs should consider tweaking events rather than rewriting existing world records.
Media playback is not supported on this device Koeman has advised midfielder James McCarthy not to join the Ireland squad after previously saying he had been "massively overloaded" by the Republic. Republic manager Martin O'Neill said this week that Koeman was "bleating" about the matter. Keane added: "Maybe Everton need to look at their own training schedule." McCarthy, 25, has been ruled out of the Republic's World Cup qualifier against Austria on Saturday because of a hamstring injury. He has missed most of his club's season because of injury but played in the Republic's qualifier wins over Georgia and Moldova last month. That angered Everton boss Koeman, who has only seen McCarthy play 33 minutes of competitive action for the Premier League club since then. However, Keane says he "could not care less" about Koeman's concerns - and also criticised previous Toffees manager Roberto Martinez. "Everton traditionally have always had brilliant Irish players doing well for the football club, so they shouldn't be so quick to stop Irish players coming to play for Ireland," said the former Manchester United midfielder. "We have had a problem previously with Martinez - I think he was slightly over the top. "Every time, we felt, the Everton players were turning up - and this is not a criticism of the players, this is more from Everton and their staff - they were always carrying knocks. "I always felt the Everton players were going to turn up on crutches or crawling in the hotel door, and now it looks like we are probably going to have that issue again with Koeman. I hope not. "Maybe Everton as a club need to - and it's a brilliant football club - maybe their players need to toughen up a little bit."

The 24-year-old, who played 16 games on loan at Kilmarnock last season, will compete with James Tavernier. Hodson started his career at Watford and played 51 games in three seasons at MK Dons after a loan at Brentford. He joins new faces Matt Gilks, Clint Hill, Joey Barton, Niko Kranjcar, Jordan Rossiter, Matt Crooks and Josh Windass at Ibrox. Rangers paid an undisclosed fee for Hodson, who was part of Northern Ireland's squad at Euro 2016, but did not feature in any of their four matches.	Rangers have made right-back Lee Hodson their eighth summer signing on a three-year deal from MK Dons.
The Richmond Park and North Kingston MP said he was "honoured" after winning 70% of the 9,227 votes cast using an online primary system. He beat London Assembly Member Andrew Boff, MEP Syed Kamall and London's deputy mayor for crime and policing Stephen Greenhalgh. Mr Goldsmith's main rival is likely to be Labour's Sadiq Khan. Mr Khan beat former cabinet minister Tessa Jowell and a number of other current MPs to win the Labour nomination last month. Caroline Pidgeon is the Lib Dem candidate, Sian Berry will contest the election for the Greens and UKIP has chosen its culture spokesman Peter Whittle. Former Respect MP George Galloway is also running. Mr Goldsmith, who was the favourite for the Tory nomination, balloted his constituents earlier this year to seek permission to stand. At the very point of his entry into the race for London mayor, Zac Goldsmith's decision revealed two big characteristics. Only a politician with an acute sense of accountability would have sought permission to stand through a ballot of his constituency members in Richmond and North Kingston. Only someone with his personal wealth would have been able to afford the estimated Â£60,000 cost of doing it. Both characteristics could come to feature heavily in the months to come. Read the whole article He won Friday's vote comfortably, getting 6,514 votes, more than the other three candidates combined. Syed Kamall came second with 1,477 votes ahead of Stephen Greenhalgh (864) and Andrew Boff (372). Mr Goldsmith - who first entered Parliament in 2010 - told the BBC's Daily Politics that he hoped his environmental record would appeal to Green and Lib Dem voters and he also hoped to "reach out" to UKIP supporters frustrated with politics as usual and the UK's relationship with the EU. Mr Goldsmith, who has confirmed he would stand down from Parliament if he became mayor, triggering a by-election, said he wanted to build on current mayor Boris Johnson's achievements. But he said anyone who attempted to replicate Mr Johnson's style of leadership would be "deluded" as he was a "unique figure" in British politics. "If people are in the market for a 'Boris mark two' are going to be very disappointed," he said, adding that people wanted someone who "will bend George Osborne's ear and get a good deal for London". He also told the BBC News Channel that high-polluting vehicles should be "phased out" of the capital's streets and that his biggest priority would be housing. Both Mr Khan and Mr Goldsmith oppose a new runway at Heathrow airport, a fact described by the British Chambers of Commerce as "depressing". Mr Goldsmith is also promising more transport investment to prevent London "grinding to a halt" and to "protect, enhance and improve access" to green spaces. Current mayor Boris Johnson will step down next year after two terms in office. He is also currently the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, having been returned to Parliament in May. Some Conservatives have called for an inquiry into the mayoral election process after only 9,227 people voted - compared with a 87,884 turnout for the Labour contest. In an attempt to open up the contest to people who weren't Conservative members, anyone on the electoral roll was able register to vote for Â£1. But one of the campaign teams told the BBC earlier this month the process "looked chaotic". Speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics, Mr Galloway dismissed Mr Goldsmith as a "Great Gatsby figure" who could not relate to most Londoners' lives and Mr Khan as "a very boring man". He revealed policies including compulsorily purchasing any house left vacant for more than a year and having 50% of all homes in the capital as social housing.	Zac Goldsmith will contest the 2016 London mayoral election for the Conservatives, it has been announced.
Media playback is not supported on this device Fury upset Klitschko last November to secure the WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight titles but was charged by the UK Anti-Doping Agency (Ukad) in June. A provisional suspension was lifted pending an independent investigation. Fury, who fights Klitschko at the Manchester Arena, has denied any wrongdoing and threatened to sue Ukad. Co-promoter Frank Warren said: "After all the injuries and contractual problems, there is no danger of the fight not happening." I'm just waiting for my revenge. I'm obsessed with the goal of getting the belts back. The road to Fury-Klitschko II has been a rocky one. It was originally scheduled for July before the 28-year-old Englishman turned an ankle in training. In June, the media got wind that Fury and his cousin Hughie, also a heavyweight boxer, had been charged with a doping offence after the banned substance nandrolone was allegedly discovered in their urine samples. However, the samples were taken 19 months ago, nine months before Fury outpointed his Ukrainian rival, 40, in Dusseldorf. Fury claims he was told by Ukad that he would face no action over the test and that a blood test taken at the time, as well as all tests since, revealed no traces. Hughie's case will also be reviewed by the National Anti-Doping Panel. Fury's long-time promoter Mick Hennessy said he was "very, very confident" that his fighter would be exonerated after the investigation. Fury did not attend Monday's news conference in London because his car broke down on the way down from his home in Morecambe. But his uncle and trainer Peter Fury said the boxer was "very upset" with Ukad and the way he has been treated by the British public. "There's been chaos around this fight, especially with Ukad slipping statements out to the press," said Peter Fury. "Tyson was found guilty before he was even tried. But I told him that the main thing is he knows what the truth is and that it will come out eventually." At a news conference to announce the first fight between the two rivals, Fury turned up as Batman, prompting Klitschko to speculate that perhaps he had dressed as the Invisible Man on Monday. Klitschko, who had threatened to sue Fury's team over alleged contract tampering, also suggested his rival might not even show up on fight night. "I wouldn't have been surprised if Tyson Fury had turned up and sung a song, so I'm not surprised he hasn't turned up at all," said Klitschko, whose defeat by Fury in their first encounter was his first for more than 11 years. "Even if it doesn't happen in October, I will wait. I've never had such a long break between fights but I've been active, even if I haven't been competing. "I'm just waiting for my revenge. I just hope he's going to turn up. "I'm enjoying being the challenger. It has been a great experience for me and it has made me obsessed with the goal of getting the belts back again." "I don't feel my age. I'm still capable of performing as an athlete and I've just gained more experience as a fighter. And I'm not concerned about ring rust, because ring rust is in your head." Asked how the rematch would be different, Klitschko said: "The end of the fight is going to be different. I'm not just obsessed about winning this fight, I'm obsessed about winning impressively." Since beating Klitschko, Fury has been stripped of his IBF title for refusing to fight the governing body's mandatory challenger. The IBF belt is now held by Fury's compatriot Anthony Joshua, while American Deontay Wilder is the WBC champion.

A report by the Food and Agriculture Organization said agriculture accounted for about a fifth of emissions, which it said needed to be reduced. The State of Food & Agriculture 2016 report said "business as usual" would leave millions at risk from hunger. Last year, nations adopted a UN goal of ending hunger by 2030. "The climate is changing, so agriculture must change too," explained Rob Voss, director of FAO's Agricultural Development Economics division. "We are saying that because agriculture is already very affected by the impacts of climate change, particularly the countries in the tropical zones. "Also, agriculture is contributing itself to about one fifth of the global emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases," Mr Voss, who headed the team that produced the FAO State of Food & Agriculture 2016 report, added. "If we continue along the present pathways then we will not be able to [deliver] food security around the world and we will not be able to stabilise the climate." As a result, he told BBC News, there was a need for "major changes" to take place in the sector. "One of the challenges is agriculture itself. As soon as we shovel the ground then we are already releasing greenhouse gas emissions. Also, as it is so dependent on water and quality of land, any impact from the change in climate has a direct impact." Therefore, he said, the challenge was bearing these changes in mind and looking at ways to shift to a more sustainable footing. "A lot of the technologies that are available that allow us to do things differently do face a number of hurdles, especially when it comes to smallholder farmers in developing countries.' These include the cost of changing the way farmers produce their food; knowledge of shifting to the novel ways of farming; urbanisation; access to water. In terms of making the change to deliver a robust global food system, Mr Voss said the report highlighted four steps that could be taken: "First, put in the steps that would help farmers switch to more sustainable practices, such as more efficient use of fertilizers and using heat tolerant and drought resistant crop varieties." He added that management systems, such as agroforestry - which places forestry cultivation around farmlands, would also be beneficial as it helps farmers build in great resilience against the impacts of climate change. "Secondly, we need to work harder to increase the capacity of soils and forestry to sequestrate carbon. Deforestation and changes to land-use is one of the major sources of emissions from the sector. "A third area where we can immediately start work on is to reduce food losses and waste. We estimate that about one third of the food we produce gets lost in the post-harvest process or gets wasted at the consumer end. "The fourth area, which is more challenging, is to try and do something about people's diets. What we have been seeing around the world is a clear shift towards increasing demands for food products that put a lot more pressure on natural resources." The report observed: "Rebalancing diets towards less animal-sourced foods would make an important contribution in this direction, with probable co-benefits for human health." FAO director-general Jose Graziano da Silva said that the coming twelve months should be about "putting commitments into action", referring to the adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goal of delivering "zero hunger" by 2030. He also observed that agriculture was set to be one of the main topics for discussion at the forthcoming UN climate summit in Morocco in November. "Climate change threatens all dimensions of food security," Mr Graziano da Silva warned. "It will expose both urban and rural poor to higher and more volatile food prices. It will also affect food availability by reducing the productivity of crops, livestock and fisheries." He stated: "Hunger, poverty and climate change need to be tackled together."

The singer-songwriter appeared on two of the festival's smaller stages - the iArena on Friday night and the Other Voices stage on Saturday. His low-key appearances came a week after he played three sold-out solo shows at Wembley Stadium. Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds will close the festival's 10th anniversary event with a headline slot on Sunday. Portishead headlined the event on Saturday, and were joined by Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke before he played his own unannounced set at the iArena later that night. Mercury Prize winners Alt-J headlined on Friday. The bill also included music from the Manic Street Preachers and Laura Marling, comedy from Jason Manford and Ruby Wax and theatre companies like Kneehigh and Paines Plough. Sheeran played the festival at the start of his career and grew up in nearby Framlingham. He is now one of the Britain's biggest pop stars, having sold more than two million copies of his second album X in the UK. He announced his Friday night set on Twitter about an hour in advance. By the time word had spread, estimates put the crowd numbers at the woodland arena at between 1,000-3,000. The Guardian's critic Harriet Gibsone said he played an hour-long set comprising covers of songs like Blackstreet's No Diggity, Stevie Wonder's Superstition and Bill Withers' Ain't No Sunshine. Olly Gregson, 18, from Sussex, said: "It was an amazing show, really intimate. "Everyone was dancing and singing along. That's the best time I've ever seen him, just because it was so small. You see him in stadiums, arenas and stuff, but it's obviously amazing, the intimacy, so close to it." The following night's set was shorter but even more intimate. The festival's blog said: "Ed himself admits that he wasn't planning this, he was just having some fun. "So it came to be that a little before midnight at the Other Voices stage, Ed walks on to perhaps no more than 80 people, guitar in hand, and breaks into Thinking Out Loud." Sheeran went on to play Nina Simone's Feelin' Good and was joined by Snow Patrol's Jonny Quinn and Nathan Connolly for the band's hit Chasing Cars. The setting was a far cry from Wembley Stadium, where Sheeran played for 80,000 people last Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Following a set by The Unthanks, a small crowd of about 150 people in the Other Voices room were treated to a short surprise set by Ed Sheeran. Taking to the stage shortly before midnight, Sheeran told the crowd: "I'm quite cut at the moment, wasn't expecting to play." Armed with just his guitar, and minus his loop pedals, he played a traditional Irish song and a Nina Simone cover before being joined on stage by two members of Snow Patrol to play Chasing Cars. And with that, he was gone.	Singer Ed Sheeran has delighted fans at the Latitude Festival in Suffolk by playing two surprise sets.
The move mirrors an update by Apple in September that allowed ad-blockers to be installed as extensions for the Safari browser. Blockers on Samsung phones will have to be added in the same way and will not come as standard. The new browser has begun rolling out for Android Lollipop or higher users. Popular ad-blockers, Adblock Fast and Crystal, have already been made available for Samsung phones. As well as making web pages less cluttered, ad-blockers often improve browsers' performance - and reduce the draw on phone batteries and data plans. "Those who use ad-blockers will likely use other browsers than the default one," said advertising industry analyst Daniel Knapp at IHS. "It's nonetheless important for Samsung to jump on the ad-blocking bandwagon." "It wants to show customers that it is a premium brand that protects them as well as Apple." Mr Knapp also told the BBC there had been a "seismic change" in the ad industry, in which marketing budgets were increasingly being moved from traditional forms of advertising to, for example, sponsorship deals. He said it was those most highly prized by advertisers, young and affluent users, who were more likely to use ad-blockers in the first place. "I think it's an expression of massive consumer dissatisfaction with the way the ad industry works," he said. Ad-blockers work by removing scripts in web page code that would otherwise pull content from ad networks' servers. In November, 18% of British adults online were using some form of ad-blocker, up 3% from June, according to a report from the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB). Meanwhile, in Facebook's annual financial filing, the social network announced advertising earnings of $5.64bn (Â£3.9bn) for the fourth quarter of 2015 but warned ad-blockers could "adversely affect" future profits. "If such technologies continue to proliferate, in particular with respect to mobile platforms, our future financial results may be harmed," it said. But Mr Knapp said companies such as Facebook were less likely than other content publishers to be affected by mobile web ad-blockers because ads could still be delivered via their third-party apps. "Think of ad-blockers being admitted to iOS 9," he said. "They were all exclusively focused on the in-browser environment - not for third-party apps like Facebook."	The latest version of the default web browser on Samsung's Android phones will allow users to install ad-blocker extensions.
On Wednesday, the electric carmaker reported a first quarter loss of $282m (Â£195m) up from $154m last year. The loss was in line with investors' expectations, and the announcement that it was increasing production sent its shares up 4% in after-hours trading. Tesla had been struggling to ramp up production of its cars including its newest Model X SUV. Production of the Model X rose from 507 in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 2,659 in the first quarter of 2016. The company confirmed it was on track to deliver 80,000 to 90,000 electric vehicles this year. Tesla said it had seen demand rise across all its models, especially its Model 3 - the carmaker's first mass-market product. Deliveries of the Model 3 are due to hit the market in 2017 and the company received 325,000 orders for the car within a week of announcing it. This could result in $14bn in future sales. To meet that demand Tesla has cut two years off its timeline for ramping up production. "Increasing production five-fold over the next two years will be challenging and will likely require some additional capital, but this is our goal," chief executive Elon Musk said in a latter to investors. Tesla said its capital expenditure - money spent to grow the company - would probably increase by 50%. Some investors have been concerned about Tesla's cash flow. The company has been spending money to increase its manufacturing facilities. Though it has seen orders rise, the carmaker has yet to make a profit. Since the start of the year Tesla has faced some production hurdles. A shortage of parts for its Model X stalled production in January and February. On Wednesday, Tesla announced two of its manufacturing heads were stepping down from their roles. Greg Reichow, vice president of production will take a leave of absence as soon as a successor can be found. Josh Ensign, vice-president of manufacturing, is also leaving the company.	Tesla Motors says it is on track to produce 500,000 vehicles in 2018, two years earlier than expected.
The watchdog said these were some of the "main barriers" to local authority participation in the scheme. It estimates a need for 10,664 school places and 4,930 homes for the 20,000 refugees due to be taken in by 2020. The government said it remained on track with its programme. The NAO's report highlighted the government's success in having "expanded the original programme at speed to achieve a new target" of resettling 1,000 refugees by last Christmas, and progress in improving refugees' own experiences of the programme. However, it said there could be significant problems in meeting the target of resettling 20,000 refugees if pledges of help from local authorities did not become firm offers. 10,664 childcare and school places needed to meet UK commitment 4,930 homes required 2,659  refugees resettled so far 49% are under the age of 18 55% are survivors of torture or violence 118 local authorities have volunteered to resettle families Participation by local authorities is voluntary, and they can make what is known as an "indicative pledge" to resettle refugees before upgrading this to a "firm offer" once accommodation, support and other services have been secured. Although there has been a 97% success rate for allocating refugees to firm offers, by the end of June 2016 there were only 125 firm offers to cover 1,078 cases of refugees accepted for resettlement. According to the NAO, local authorities say the main thing preventing them from participating fully is that they are struggling to find suitable housing and enough school places. The report says that just under a third (31%) of refugees settled so far are of school age. Of those refugees still to come to the UK through the programme, an estimated 7,655 will be of school age and a further 3,009 will become old enough to enter the education system during the programme. But the NAO said school places were already "in short supply" and cited its 2013 report on funding for new school places, which revealed that about one in five primary schools were full or over capacity. The NAO also estimates that about 20% of children in the resettlement programme are expected to have special educational needs. This means local authorities will probably have to provide more than 1,500 special educational needs places, the NAO said - and some local authorities have already "turned away cases because they were unable to provide the required places". The programme so far has required 655 homes and is estimated to need a further 4,930 before 2020, based on the size of families resettled so far. Some councils had been successful in partnering with the private rental sector to house refugees, the report said, but others were "struggling to do so". Local authorities in areas where accommodation costs are high also have concerns about finding affordable accommodation for refugees given the current housing benefit cap. This has meant only 11% of refugees have been settled in areas such as London and the South East. Meg Hillier MP, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said: "Local authorities should be applauded for stepping up to help these people in desperate need. "But already under pressure local authorities will have to find over 10,600 childcare and school places, and nearly 5,000 homes over the course of the programme as well as social and community support services. "We need to be convinced that the government is committed to supporting local authorities in their efforts and is clear about its expectations and funding beyond the first year of a refugee's stay in the UK." Refugee Council head of advocacy Lisa Doyle said it was "fantastic" that UK communities were welcoming refugees. She said: "Each Syrian refugee welcomed by the UK will have their life transformed, if not saved by this programme. "The UK government must build on this success by offering more refugees safe passage here, particularly by enabling more refugees with family here to join them smoothly and swiftly." Refugee Action chief executive Stephen Hale said: "We are pleased that the programme has been established but I think there is a lot to do to help refugees integrate into Britain." He said the government's funding of English language classes was "crucial" in helping refugees integrate. A government spokesman said: "We ask local authorities to consider carefully whether they have the necessary infrastructure and support networks before a resettlement occurs. "We will only resettle individuals to a particular area once we've ensured these arrangements, including school places and housing, are in place." He added: "The level of funding enables local authorities to provide vulnerable refugees with a safe environment and the chance to rebuild their lives."	The government's Syrian vulnerable persons resettlement programme could be "at risk" because of a lack of school places and accommodation, a National Audit Office report has warned.
The city in western Germany is putting 2,500 police officers on the streets for the week-long event. Germany was shocked by the New Year assaults, largely blamed on migrants. More than 100 women were victims, but the full scale only emerged later. Separately, police have arrested three suspected Islamist militants in raids. Cologne sex attacks: Women describe 'terrible' assaults The raids on flats and offices took place on Thursday in Berlin, Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia. The two men and one woman detained are among four suspected of links to the so-called Islamic State group. One of those held was being sought by Algerian authorities, and they may have been planning an attack in Germany, police said. The New Year unrest in Cologne fuelled German unease about a huge influx of asylum seekers. Two men - a Tunisian and a Moroccan - have been charged over the Cologne offences. But in total there were 945 complaints to Cologne police after the New Year trouble, 559 of them allegations of sexual assault. Thirty-five suspects are being investigated. German authorities spoke of a new type of crime, in which gangs of drunken men - described as North African - targeted women. Cologne resident Miriam was attacked as she and a friend made her way home on New Year's Eve. She said she was going to the carnival celebrations "but with really mixed feelings". "I'm wondering if something like that could happen again." Miriam's mother, Jozi, said the incident changed the way she sees migrants. "We live in a multicultural area with lots of Moroccans, I've never had a second thought before - we're friends, we greet each other, talk to each other. It was all fine. But now I'm looking at it with different eyes." Organisers have not said how many people have attended this year's carnival, but correspondents say the numbers are much lower than in previous years. Police will be present at a new "Security Point" for women near Cologne Cathedral - the area where most of the assaults took place during New Year celebrations. Police have been trialling "body cams" which can film suspects during incidents. German authorities have also brought in British face recognition experts to help identify those involve in the attacks on New Year's Eve. Known as "super-recognisers", the officers from the London Metropolitan Police can recognise up to 95% of the faces they have seen - compared to about 20% for most people. Migration to Germany from outside the EU soared to a record 1.1 million last year. The Cologne assaults contributed to a slump in the approval rating of Chancellor Angela Merkel. She has been criticised by conservative allies, as well as by many opposition politicians, for having welcomed so many asylum seekers to Germany. The many Syrian and Iraqi refugees generally get asylum, but many economic migrants from outside the EU are also trying to settle in Germany.	Cologne has beefed up security for the city's annual carnival, after many women suffered sexual assaults and robberies there on New Year's Eve.
The injured girl was riding the the Hogwarts Express train with her family, who were on holiday from Tennessee visiting Universal Studios in Orlando. Police described the explosion as a "fireball", burning the girl's face. "It was just a weird, freak accident," Lieutenant Dan Brady told the Orlando Sentinel. "It wasn't a big explosion but was definitely enough to scare everyone who was in that cab of the train," he added. Her name has not been released. The girl was riding the train, which connects Universal Studios with the Island of Adventure theme park, at about 15:30 local time (19:30 GMT) on Saturday when the device exploded. The girl suffered mild burns to her face, arm, and leg, and was taken to hospital. The vapouriser was inside another man's pocket when it malfunctioned, causing minor burns to his leg. The explosion burned a hole in a seat, but otherwise there was no significant damage to the train, officials say. Universal Studios shut down the ride temporarily to allow detectives to investigate. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter opened at Universal Studios in 2010.	A 14-year-old girl suffered burns on a Harry Potter ride when another passenger's electronic cigarette exploded, police in Florida say.
As reported in the Daventry Express, Sam Chambers, coach of Weedon Bec Primary School, sent his CV to the FA after England crashed out of Euro 2016. "I feel like the perfect candidate as I have guided my school... to an unbeaten 2015-16 season," he wrote. Ladbrokes has made him a 1,000/1 outsider for the job. Roy Hodgson stood down as England manager after the shock 2-1 defeat to Iceland last week. Jessica Bridge from the bookmaker said: "Stranger things have happened in the last 12 months, like Leicester City winning the Premier League, so it's not out of the realms of possibility. "Sam enters the record books as one of the greatest sporting underdogs of all time." Mr Chambers, who describes himself as a "sports enthusiast", faces stiff competition from current favourites Jurgen Klinsmann and Sam Allardyce, but says he has the passion to be a success in the job. "I, along with millions across the nation, saw our beloved team fall to the minnows that are Iceland," he wrote in his covering letter to the FA. "It is my intention, should I be given the opportunity, to re-kindle the enthusiasm of the nation for the round-ball game." Elaborating on his school's impressive season, Mr Chambers added he had guided his side to an unbeaten campaign - even though they faced "mighty teams such as Woodford Halse CE Primary Academy". He ends the letter with an optimistic "I look forward to hearing from you all!" The FA is yet to comment on Mr Chambers' application. Earlier this year, a seven-year-old boy failed in his quest to become Inverness Caledonian Thistle's new manager, despite a pledge that his headmaster would probably let him leave school early "for important matches and training".	The coach of a primary school football team has applied for the England job, saying he is the "perfect candidate" to succeed Roy Hodgson.
Provisional data from the Department for Transport (DfT) showed the 3% rise came alongside a 2.2% increase in traffic in the 12 months to September. AA president Edmund King said the death toll was the "equivalent of three plane crashes" and called for more action. Separate DfT figures suggest about 240 deaths in 2014 involved drivers over the legal alcohol limit. Officials said the rise in deaths in the year ending September 2015 was not "statistically significant" - meaning the increase was "probably to do with a combination of factors that have come about by chance, rather than any specific change". Steve Gooding, director of automotive research charity the RAC Foundation, said: "Forty-nine more people dying on the roads might not be statistically significant, but try telling that to their family and friends. "It is true that traffic is on the rise again and that might partly explain why the downward trend in road deaths has plateaued in recent years. "But the pressing question is: what do we now do to get back on track?" Neil Greig, the Institute of Advanced Motorists' director of policy and research, said that although drink-drive deaths were "flatlining", the numbers were still "unacceptable". He called for the drink-drive limit elsewhere in Britain to be lowered to be in line with Scotland. In 2014, the Scottish government reduced the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg. The DfT said the new estimated figure of 240 road deaths involving people over the legal alcohol limit in 2014 meant the level was unchanged from 2013. Roads Minister Andrew Jones said: "Britain continues to have some of the safest roads in the world but we cannot be complacent on road safety and are determined to do more. "We launched our road safety plan last year which includes plans for tougher penalties for people using mobile phones while driving, extra money to crack down on drug-drivers and funding to train the next generation of cyclists."	Some 1,780 people died on Britain's roads last year - 49 more than the previous year, new figures suggest.
The 40ft (12m) whale was discovered by wardens at the Holkham National Nature Reserve on Thursday. The Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme (CSIP) was contacted and a post-mortem examination is expected to be carried out. Evolutionary biologist Dr Ben Garrod said it was "really unusual" for a fin whale to be found on the east coast. For more on the whale and other stories, visit the BBC Norfolk Live page "It should not be in those waters," he said. "We see fin whales occasionally on the southern coast or more the west coast of the UK, so Ireland, right up to Scotland. "But you never get them in the North Sea so what it was doing there, we have no idea at the moment." Dr Garrod, who is based at the Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge, said it was not yet known what killed the whale. He said: "There are no obvious signs of net entanglement, no obvious signs of boat strike, not a clue, and that's what is so interesting." The beach has remained open but Holkham Estate has urged members of the public not to venture close to the whale carcass and to keep dogs on leads. Dr Garrod also urged members of the public to show the whale respect. He said graffiti was found on the sperm whales which were washed up on the Norfolk coast in January. "I would be heartbroken to see that happen to this big, beautiful visitor to our waters," said Dr Garrod.	An expert has been left puzzled as to why a fin whale has washed up on the coast of north Norfolk.
It's not natural Labour territory. The party has lost every election here since 1950. At this year's general election, the Conservatives were returned with an 18,000 majority. But the people of Chelmsford, in Essex, were queuing round the block outside the city's civic theatre to hear Jeremy Corbyn. If this had been a football crowd, there would have been purveyors of hot pies. If it had been an audience waiting to the see the latest cinema blockbuster, there would be popcorn vendors. But it's the 87th Corbyn rally of the Labour leadership campaign. So the products being paraded at the venue were food for thought - newspapers from parties and factions to the left, or on the left, of Labour - Socialist Worker, Socialist Appeal, Labour Briefing. There were almost as many people here as there have been Corbyn rebellions against his own party leadership. So why were 500 giving up their evening to hear the veteran left winger? "He's a breath of fresh air," says Helen Davenport, a teacher who had left the Labour party for the Greens. "I gave up hope," she says. "But now there's an alternative. I like his ideas on renationalising rail and he has a more sympathetic policy on immigration. He has the wisdom of Tony Benn." Sasha McLoughlin agrees: "It's the first time a Labour leader has represented me in years. You vote Labour because that's what you do but it's so exciting to have a leftwing leader, not a Tory in disguise." Further up the line was Gerard Darcy. He says he wasn't a natural Corbyn supporter but found him to be "straight-talking". He went on: "There's no artifice. No spin. The other candidates are preened, moulded. He looks like a 70s sociology lecturer but people are now in to the issues, not the image - no one cares about what his smile looks like." He says Andy Burnham would be "excellent" but is now his second choice. And the phenomenon that is Corbynmania continued inside the venue. In the media scrum that now surrounds him everywhere he goes, he was asked by Finnish television to give advice to their social democrats, and by Le Monde to comment on French President Francois Hollande's move to the right. Incidentally, he responds that Hollande "hasn't felt sufficiently able to challenge austerity". Not a criticism he would level at himself. So how has a left-winger who had languished on the backbenches  - someone to whom Ed Miliband's former chief of staff Lucy Powell admits to never having spoken - now become something of an international celebrity? He seems quite bemused yet nonplussed by the attention. He needed the support of 35 Labour MPs to get on the ballot and he points out he only got enough nominations with just one minute fifteen seconds to the deadline. This was no long-standing left-wing conspiracy. He had to "max out" his credit card to get the campaign started and while he has received donations from trade unions such as Unite and communications workers' union the CWU, he appeared to have caught an anti-austerity zeitgeist, with his targets for "crowdfunding" from individuals exceeded. Irrespective of his politics, he does look and sound different from his Oxbridge educated opponents, all of whom were advisers to Labour politicians before becoming MPs. He's a generation older, for a start. At 66, he was a Haringey councillor in the 70s and 80s before the other contenders even went to university. "I have got very few qualifications," he tells me -  he dropped out of North London Polytechnic - "but I have a fascination of reading and read a lot. I spent a lot of time in the school library and the local library and I have this view that everyone I meet knows something I don't know and we can learn from each other." He was weaned on socialist literature. Not for him the Famous Five: "My mother gave me the Ragged Trousered Philanthropists to read." This was Robert Tressell's novel of working class life in Mugsborough - or Hastings - before World War One, and the philanthropists of the title are the people who are all too willing to do back-breaking work for the benefit of their "betters". His maths-teacher mother also gave him the diaries of George Orwell. He spent two years on voluntary service overseas in the Caribbean, but first became active in politics in Shropshire. He founded the Wrekin Young Socialists - the youth wing of the Labour Party -  in the mid-60s. He was the organisation's secretary and regularly attracted 40 to 50 youthful activists to Sunday night meetings. He produced a magazine and organised protests against nuclear weapons and the Vietnam War - perhaps the perfect pedigree for someone who would go on to form the Stop the War coalition with CND stalwart Monsignor Bruce Kent in 2001 - though it's worth remembering that was initially a protest against intervention in Afghanistan, not Iraq. He is not in principle against the deployment of British troops but cannot think of current circumstances where he would do so. He first successfully fought his Islington North in seat in 1983, when the party went down to a disastrous defeat nationally under Michael Foot's leadership on a platform of unilateral disarmament and withdrawal from the EU. Labour had moved decisively to the left in London, too, but with more success. Ken Livingstone was at the head of the then Greater London Council, later abolished by Mrs Thatcher's government. It had been literally a divisive time for his party, with some former cabinet ministers splitting away to form the SDP. Meanwhile some of those on the left tried to unseat MPs they regarded as too right-wing, but who hadn't jumped ship. Corbyn had backed Tony Benn's unsuccessful attempt to become the party's deputy leader - he was very narrowly defeated by Denis Healey. So what had he learned from that period of division? "It taught me in London we achieved a great deal - on transport, on the environment - but it also taught me the formation of the SDP was catastrophic to the electoral chances of Labour. "The Conservative so-called triumph in 1983 owed more to the division of the opposition vote than a move to the left. But it also taught me that you have to take communities with you." There has been a lot of focus on Jeremy Corbyn's disloyalty to his own party. He rebelled on a quarter of all votes during the 2005-2010 government. But I wondered why he had stayed loyal to Labour rather than moving to any of a myriad of parties to its Left when some of the policies he held dear - on nuclear weapons and re-nationalisation - had been ditched? "I want to see a more equal, more just society and the Labour Party has always been the vehicle to achieve that, especially with its organic link to the trade unions. I have argued my case on lots of issues and I think things are changing." And this is his verdict on the 2015 election: "One of the reasons we lost is we weren't offering anything sufficiently different." Well, you certainly couldn't accuse him of not wishing to put that right. He tells an appreciative if not overly enthusiastic audience in Essex that the government's welfare bill "is absolutely brutal" and he will oppose the benefits cap. The cost of welfare is so high, he says, in part because of high rents - which in turn are a symptom of not building enough affordable homes. He rebelled against his party's abstention on the welfare bill while Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham, despite their doubts, stuck with collective shadow cabinet responsibility. They see that episode as the catalyst for Corbynmania. He rails against tuition fees, but also opposes those in his party who want to see a graduate tax. He said that "wise" old Tony Benn had told him: "you should tax people because they are wealthy, not because they are educated." And he defends his policy of using quantitative easing - whereby the Bank of England would increase the supply of money in the economy - to fund infrastructure projects. His critics say it would push up inflation and erode living standards. He responds: "If you said to people in Germany I have a radical new idea of a National Investment Bank they would just shrug their shoulders and say we are doing that already. What's extreme about that?" And on challenging the agenda of austerity, he says his party has to be bold. The debt ridden government of 1945 - when, after a by-election, even Chelmsford briefly had a Labour MP - "didn't retrench, it invested". There is a feeling, though, that if his campaign isn't running out of steam, he to some extent is - cramming in public meetings, rallies and media appearances. "That's socialism," he says as he is handed, without asking, a glass of water mid-speech as his voice finally falters. He finishes by denouncing the legacy of the Iraq War and promises "whatever the result of the leadership election" that the party's grass roots will be empowered. Mandate for change And he does go on to get a standing ovation. But I ask him how he could be at the head of a shadow cabinet that disagrees with him on fundamental issues - such as the renewal of Trident - or indeed lead a party whose policies in some key respects are very different from his own? "Whoever is elected leader will have a very large mandate from the members and the Parliamentary Labour Party - important as it is - I hope will recognise there is at the very least a mandate for a full debate within the party." Andy Burnham has said he would not be part of a shadow cabinet that didn't commit to renewing Trident. Jeremy Corbyn sees this as a matter of party democracy: "I feel strongly about nuclear weapons. We have to have that debate fairly soon as the government might reach a decision in 2016." Possibly as soon a this month's Labour Party conference. Jeremy Corbyn is the front-runner in the campaign but his critics will say that his leadership would be dominated by those internal debates within Labour that would leave little time - even with the best will in the world - to take the fight to the government. But Corbyn insists "there is a thirst for doing politics differently". We will find out just how many people are drinking in his ideas a week from now.

The world's number one aeroplane manufacturer made sales of $94.6bn, down 2%, and net earnings of $4.9bn, 5% lower. It said revenues were likely to slip further in 2017, to between $90.5bn and $92.5bn. But the US company also expects to deliver more commercial aircraft and to improve its earnings per share. "Looking forward, our team is intent on accelerating productivity and programme execution," said chairman and chief executive Dennis Muilenburg. In the period, Boeing made 748 commercial aircraft deliveries, down from 762 in 2015, claiming to have led the market for "the fifth consecutive year". It also delivered fewer military planes - in particular, its new CH-47 Chinook helicopter and its F/A-18 fighter jet - while sales in the division slipped 7%. Revenue also fell in the firm's space and services divisions because of weaker demand for satellites and aircraft modernisation. However, overall group earnings surged 59% in the fourth quarter of the year as demand for the company's commercial planes ticked up. Boeing also projected higher commercial deliveries this year of between 760 and 765 aircraft. The company's shares were up by more than 2% in early trading in New York.	Sales and profits slipped at Boeing last year, driven largely by lower deliveries of its military aircraft.
The 18-year-old, who is the third-youngest player at Euro 2016, signs a five-year deal for an undisclosed fee. On Monday, Dortmund signed Bayern Munich midfielder Sebastian Rode, 25. Last week, they agreed a deal for Barcelona's Spain defender Marc Bartra, 25, after meeting his £6.25m release clause and previously signed Rennes forward Ousmane Dembele, 18.

Dean Owens, from Leith, knew that his great great grandfather Ambrose Salvona was buried somewhere in Inverness. After telling this to his audience at Perth's Southern Fried Festival, Inverness resident Judi Menabney came forward and offered to find the grave. Salvona's resting place has since been found in Tomnahurich Cemetery. Owens' research of his family tree influenced the writing of Dora, a track on his Nashville-recorded album Into the Sea. The song is about his grandmother, Dora Salvona Owens, who grew up in a circus that Salvona started in Scotland. Salvona was thought to have arrived in Scotland from Italy in the company of a dancing bear, sometime in the late 19th Century. Owens' lyrics of the song include the lines: "Somewhere way back there's a lion tamer/Ambrose and his dancing bear/He's buried in the Highlands/but we're not sure where." Ms Menabney works for High Life Highland, an organisation that runs archives, registration and family history services on Highland Council's behalf. With help from her colleagues at the Highland Archive and Registration Centre in Inverness she was able to find the grave in one of the city's largest cemeteries. Family historian Anne Fraser said: "It was great fun investigating Ambrose's story. "He turns out to have been a very colourful character - which may not be a surprise - but we have also finished up raising as many questions as we've answered." The staff at the centre found out that Salvona was married twice and was the father of at least 10 children. He was 80 when he first arrived in Inverness and was, at the end of his life at the age of 88, a resident of a poor house that later became Hilton Hospital and is today a block of flats. Salvona appears to been a popular figure in the Highland town. A procession of people carried his body to a prominent position at Tomnahurich following his death on 13 October 1917. The inscription on the gravestone acknowledges his career as a lion tamer. Owens said: "I can't believe the final resting place of my great great grandfather has been found. "I'm very grateful to Judi, Anne and their colleagues for all the work they've put into discovering his story. "I'm delighted they want to use it and my song Dora - which started the search - in their own presentations." The singer added: "You really don't know what's up there, way up in the family tree. And maybe there's another song in that."	A singer-songwriter has tracked down the grave of a circus lion tamer ancestor with help from an audience member at one of his gigs.
A yellow "be aware" warning has been issued for late Thursday into Friday for the Western and Northern Isles, Highlands and Argyll. The warning also applies to parts of Moray and Aberdeenshire. Earlier this year the Met Office asked the public for suggestions for names for storms. Storm Abigail could bring gusts of 60 to 70mph, potentially rising to speeds of up to 80mph in exposed areas. The warning is in place from 18:00 on Thursday until 14:00 on Friday. In its warning, the Met Office said: "The public should be aware of the risk of disruption to transport. In addition, large waves may give rise to local over-topping along some coasts. "A vigorous depression is expected to pass just to the northwest of Scotland on Thursday night bringing a swathe of very strong winds on its eastern and southern flanks. "There remains some uncertainty regarding the exact extent and timing of strongest winds and the extent of impacts and this warning will be kept under review." Sea swell charts produced by South Devon-based surfing website Magicseaweed.com suggest swell reaching heights of 10-11.5m (36-38ft) on Friday. Meteorologist Dr Eddy Graham, who lectures at Lews Castle College UHI in Stornoway in Lewis, said people should stay indoors if the weather deteriorates. He said: "The Met Office have issued the first high wind warning of the season for this Thursday and Friday for most of northern and western Scotland. "Winds are expected to reach over 70mph, possibly touching 80mph in the strongest gusts. Winds of these speeds are dangerous when outdoors - stay safely indoors when conditions deteriorate."	Storm Abigail, the first storm to be officially named by the Met Office, is set to bring winds of up to 80mph to parts of Scotland later this week.
Heydrich - one of the architects of the Final Solution when he was governor of occupied Bohemia - was assassinated by British-trained Czech and Slovak troops in May 1942. It was an operation which was so audacious in its planning and execution that it inspired John Martin from Mold, Flintshire, to research the topic for more than 40 years. He interviewed Heydrich's son, and descendants of the Special Operations Executive hit-team which killed him, as part of a book which has now been made into a film. Anthropoid, named after the mission's codename, has just gone on general release. It stars actors Cillian Murphy and Fifty Shades of Grey star Jamie Dornan who portrays a Czech resistance fighter. Mr Martin, who is an extra in the film, said: "Not many people have heard of Anthropoid, partly because it was earlier on in the war, and partly because afterwards Britain's role was played down by the Soviets. "It took me until after the fall of the Iron Curtain to be able to get into Prague and properly investigate what happened." Born in 1904, Reinhard Heydrich was a decorated German naval officer in the Weimar Republic. During the rise of the Nazis he progressed quickly to head several branches of the Nazi secret police, including the Gestapo and SD, and was a key figure in both 'The Night of The Long Knives' and 'Kristallnacht'. As Nazi head in occupied Czechoslovakia, he was instructed to improve the productivity of the region's flagging munitions and automobile factories. It was a role which he performed so successfully that the Allies determined he must be removed. Mr Martin said: "Before Heydrich's appointment the Czech Resistance had been quite successful in reducing productivity by as much as a third through go-slows. "Heydrich introduced a policy he called 'Sugar and Whip', whereby those who cooperated gained extra rations and clothing, whilst those who didn't were kidnapped, tortured and killed. "In one way the fact he rewarded people might be seen as a humanising feature, but I think it makes him all the more chilling. "For him, it wasn't about the violence, he'd do whatever it took to achieve the Nazis' ultimate ambitions." In December 1941 the SOE assassination squad of Josef Gabcik and Jan Kubis was parachuted into Bohemia from an RAF Halifax bomber. They spent six months undercover planning their assault, before finally ambushing Heydrich on a blind hairpin bend on the Prague to Dresden road on 27 May 1942. Heydrich died of his injuries a week later, and although the Nazis reaped devastating revenge, Mr Martin contends it was still a worthwhile mission. Mr Martin said: "Hitler personally ordered the levelling of two villages - Lidice and LeÅ¾Ã¡ky - where all the men over 16 were shot and all the women transported to concentration camps. "The ordinary population paid a terrible price for what was essentially an economic and military attack. Yet you can see in Hitler's response just what a devastating blow the assassination was. "Hitler was furious at the arrogance which led Heydrich to travel in an unguarded open top car, and later he'd say that the loss of Heydrich was the beginning of the end in the battle for the Eastern Front." Mr Martin currently works on cruise ships, where he gives both comedy performances and history lectures on Heydrich. "It's a strange life for me," he said. "One night I'll be telling jokes, and the next afternoon I'm lecturing on the holocaust. "Some comedians can make jokes about things like that, but I have to keep the two completely separate. "I'm delighted that my book's been made into a film. I can tell people about Heydrich, but it's only now they'll see him on the screen, that his true horror will really sink in."	Nicknamed "The Hangman of Prague", SS general Reinhard Heydrich was a man even Hitler himself feared as "the man with an iron heart".
Chastain, who is now retired from the sport, said she hoped it would help "change things for the positive". She joins a number of sporting figures helping to research long-term effects of concussion on competitors in sports. CTE, a degenerative disease, has been found in athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma. Chastain, 47, announced on Thursday she would be donating her brain to Boston University, which is leading studies into the effects of multiple concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). "It's scary to think about all the heading and potential concussions that were never diagnosed in my life, but it's better to know," she said, speculating about her own experience of head injury during her football career. CTE is associated with symptoms such as memory loss, depression and progressive dementia. No female athletes have been found to have suffered from CTE, the New York Times reports, though this may be because the sample size is too small. The disease has been found in a number of male sports stars - including many former American football players. CTE cases can only be diagnosed after examination of the brain post-mortem. Chastain's decision follows that of her team mate, Cindy Parlow Cone, who has also decided to donate her brain. Both women have been calling on football regulators to introduce regulation preventing children under the age of 14 from heading the ball. Research into CTE has thrown the spotlight on several sports, including American football, horse-racing and rugby in recent months. A Hollywood film about the effects of concussion on National Football League stars was released last year, starring Will Smith. In February, it was revealed Ken Stabler, one of the most celebrated quarterbacks of all time, had been suffering from the disease. Chastain became well known for scoring America's winning goal in a penalty shoot-out against China in the final of the 1999 Women's World Cup. Images of the football star kneeling on the pitch in her black sports bra, fists clenched, swept around the world, becoming an iconic image for women's football.	US football star Brandi Chastain, who shot to fame in the 1999 Women's World Cup, has pledged to donate her brain to the Concussion Legacy Foundation.
The Twickenham crowd watched England run in three tries within eight second-half minutes as the home side ran out comprehensive 38-21 winners. Their previous biggest win over New Zealand was 13-0 at Twickenham in January 1936, while the most points they had ever registered against the All Blacks was the 31 they scored at the same venue in November 2002. Only once in 498 Tests had New Zealand been beaten by a bigger margin (28-7). So, what have the pundits got to say about an England victory which very few saw coming? "I can probably see this being maybe the greatest ever England victory, ever, at Twickenham. Nothing is springing to mind where they have annihilated the world's best team as they have today. "I think I have been to every single England game at Twickenham since I was 14. This was by far the best game I've seen. "It's the best performance by an England side considering the opposition and considering what this team has been through, particularly over the last two weeks. This was absolutely magnificent. "Not only has this got to be the greatest game I've seen England play at Twickenham, we've got to put this among one of the world's greatest upsets, maybe even in any sport. Media playback is not supported on this device "It was an absolutely astonishing performance to win by 17 points. England harried, hounded and were just relentless. They said to New Zealand 'We will tackle you wherever you go and then we'll pinch the ball and see if we can live off scraps'. New Zealand cracked. "It has been England's day - this is not about today not being New Zealand's day. England have put New Zealand under pressure and they defended not only for their lives but for the 80,000 people inside Twickenham and the millions watching at home. It has been relentless and they gave everything, epitomised by man of the match Tom Wood. "People stepped up. Individuals stepped up one to 15, not just the odd player, particularly in that second half. It was wave after wave of England, whether it was defence or attack. That was the difference." Matt Dawson was speaking on BBC Radio 5 live. "It was a fantastic Test match played with great energy. This England team has had a lot of flak over the past couple of weeks and they've got a lot of pride back in the shirt. "The crowd just buzzed off it and it was wonderful to be here. "What I liked about the start was that when England walked on the field there wasn't a lot of song and dance about it, they knew they had to do a job and they took the game to New Zealand. "I said beforehand, if you're going to beat the best teams in the world, indeed become the best in the world, you've got to have self-belief and for me they played with that self-belief today. They took the game to New Zealand and deserved the victory. Media playback is not supported on this device "Looking at the first half, New Zealand will rue a couple of those missed penalties but psychologically England just built it and built it. "There was still room to improve - Ashton missed an opportunity in the corner, Tuilagi forced the ball - but this team today gelled. They got opportunities and took them - to me that's what Test match rugby is about. "It's very easy to look back at the past but England's 31-28 win against the All Blacks in 2002 was the day we actually said 'we are the top team in the world'. It was a massive transformation from which England then built for the next few years. "Hopefully we'll look back at this day not just as a great day for English rugby, but the day this team really grew up." Josh Lewsey was speaking on BBC Three. "Absolutely unbelievable. Not just to get the victory, but the best victory England have ever had against the All Blacks. No-one saw it coming, but maybe this England team did. "They played absolutely magnificently well, not just scoring penalties to build the score in the first half, but try after try in the second half. It was quite extraordinary. "Chris Robshaw was a hero - he deserves all the credit he will get. In the same way England were lambasted in defeat, when they play well - which they did, they were heroic - they should take a huge round of applause. "They got themselves 15-0 up and then conceded two soft tries, but the way they came back at New Zealand was so impressive. "The All Blacks looked shell-shocked at the end." Lawrence Dallaglio was speaking on BBC Three "It was a fantastic win. It was a great to be there, one of best games I ever seen at Twickenham. "It was the All Blacks against England who were coming off two average defeats. The scoreline reflected the performance. It was a great day for England. "I think because it was the last of the games in the series and what happened in the match means it was a David versus Goliath effort. "England got stuck into New Zealand early on and they were rattled. A key point was when Conrad Smith came flying out and England went through. "New Zealand never recovered from that. It was a great, great victory for England." Sir Clive Woodward was speaking to BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek	England's record-breaking win over New Zealand even had All Blacks coach Steve Hansen praising Stuart Lancaster's side.

Elizabeth Bowe, 50, was found badly injured in Bobby Jones Place in St Andrews at about 21:00 on Saturday 17 September. She was taken to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee but she died three days later. Her brother Charles Gordon, 51, appeared at Dundee Sheriff Court on Tuesday facing a single charge of murder. He made no plea or declaration and was remanded in custody. The police were called out to Ms Bowe's home before the incident. The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner's (PIRC) investigation was ordered by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS). A spokesman for the PIRC said: "The investigation will focus on the initial police response leading up to the incident. "A report on the Commissioner's findings will be submitted to the COPFS in due course."	The police watchdog has launched an investigation following the death of a 50-year-old woman.
Sheikh Obeikan, who was an adviser to the royal cabinet, opposed moves to relax gender segregation. The dismissal comes shortly after Sheikh Obeikan attacked plans by "influential people to corrupt Muslim society by trying to change the natural status of women". Saudi officials did not give a reason for Sheikh Obeikan's departure. His recent comments were taken to be an attack on tentative steps towards relaxing some stricter interpretations of Saudi law. King Abdullah has promised women the right to vote in future elections, has opened the country's first co-educational university and introduced measures against domestic violence. The head of Saudi Arabia's religious police, the "mutawa", was also replaced in January, with the new head widely seen as more moderate than his predecessor. Sheikh Obeikan achieved a degree of notoriety several years ago with a decree suggesting that unrelated Saudi men and women could mix so long as the man drank the woman's breast milk, thus creating a maternal bond between them.	Saudi King Abdullah has sacked one of his most hardline advisers, Sheikh Abdelmohsen al-Obeikan.
But in April - before the EU referendum - the then home secretary gave a speech warning of the implications of a vote to leave the EU. Here's how some of the key quotes compare: April 2016: "So, if we do vote to leave the European Union, we risk bringing the development of the single market to a halt, we risk a loss of investors and businesses to remaining EU member states driven by discriminatory EU policies, and we risk going backwards when it comes to international trade. "But the big question is whether, in the event of Brexit, we would be able to negotiate a new free trade agreement with the EU and on what terms." January 2017: "I respect the position taken by European leaders who have been clear about their position, just as I am clear about mine. So an important part of the new strategic partnership we seek with the EU will be the pursuit of the greatest possible access to the single market, on a fully reciprocal basis, through a comprehensive free trade agreement." April 2016: "The reality is that we do not know on what terms we would win access to the single market. We do know that in a negotiation we would need to make concessions in order to access it, and those concessions could well be about accepting EU regulations, over which we would have no say, making financial contributions, just as we do now, accepting free movement rules, just as we do now, or quite possibly all three combined. "It is not clear why other EU member states would give Britain a better deal than they themselves enjoy." January 2017: "If we were excluded from accessing the single market, we would be free to change the basis of Britain's economic model. "But for the EU, it would mean new barriers to trade with one of the biggest economies in the world. It would jeopardise investments in Britain by EU companies worth more than half a trillion pounds... and I do not believe that the EU's leaders will seriously tell German exporters, French farmers, Spanish fishermen, the young unemployed of the eurozone, and millions of others, that they want to make them poorer, just to punish Britain and make a political point." April 2016: "It is tempting to look at developing countries' economies, with their high growth rates, and see them as an alternative to trade with Europe. But just look at the reality of our trading relationship with China - with its dumping policies, protective tariffs and industrial-scale industrial espionage. And look at the figures. We export more to Ireland than we do to China, almost twice as much to Belgium as we do to India, and nearly three times as much to Sweden as we do to Brazil. It is not realistic to think we could just replace European trade with these new markets." "And while we could certainly negotiate our own trade agreements, there would be no guarantee that they would be on terms as good as those we enjoy now. There would also be a considerable opportunity cost given the need to replace the existing agreements - not least with the EU itself - that we would have torn up as a consequence of our departure." January 2017: "We want to get out into the wider world, to trade and do business all around the globe. Countries including China, Brazil, and the Gulf States have already expressed their interest in striking trade deals with us." April 2016 (responding to a question from the BBC): "What matters is that we have brought about changes in the free movement rules as a result of the negotiation." January 2017: "As home secretary for six years, I know that you cannot control immigration overall when there is free movement to Britain from Europe." April 2016: "With no agreement, we know that WTO rules would oblige the EU to charge 10% tariffs on UK car exports, in line with the tariffs they impose on Japan and the United States. They would be required to do the same for all other goods upon which they impose tariffs.  Not all of these tariffs are as high as 10%, but some are considerably higher." January 2017: "And while I am confident that this scenario need never arise - while I am sure a positive agreement can be reached - I am equally clear that no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain. "Because we would still be able to trade with Europe. We would be free to strike trade deals across the world. And we would have the freedom to set the competitive tax rates and embrace the policies that would attract the world's best companies and biggest investors to Britain."	Theresa May has said the UK will emerge from Brexit as a "great, global trading nation", becoming "safer, more secure and more prosperous".
It was one of several measures European and African leaders agreed to reduce the flow of people into Europe. The leaders said their aim was to "address the root causes of migration". The Europe-Africa meeting was planned after around 800 migrants died when their boat sank off Libya in April. Senegal's President Macky Sall, who currently heads the West African regional group Ecowas, told journalists on the sidelines of the summit that the money pledged was "not enough for the whole of Africa". Later, at the closing press conference, he said he was pleased with the trust fund, but said he would like to see it "more generously financed". Niger's President Mahamadou Issoufou echoed the Senegalese president's sentiments and added that "reform of global governance" was also needed, to make world trade fairer, Reuters news agency reports. While Somalia's Prime Minister Omar Abdirashidali Sharmatke told the BBC:  "What Africa needs today is not charity, but investment." EU Council President Donald Tusk said the summit had agreed "a long list of very concrete actions to be implemented by the end of 2016". These include setting up a joint European and African team in Niger to tackle people smuggling and increasing the number of visas available to students and researchers. "We are under no illusions that we can improve the situation overnight but we are committed to giving people alternatives to risking their lives," Mr Tusk said. The European trust fund is supposed to "foster stability... and to contribute to better migration management", according to a European Union statement. It is also aimed at "promoting economic... opportunities, security and development" in the 23 African countries named which, along with Senegal, include Nigeria, Eritrea and Libya. The money will be spent on: "Financial aid to accept deportation of thousands" declares Algerian daily El-Khabar, before quoting human rights groups warning that Europe was "forcing African countries to play the role of policeman". However, Germany's tabloid Bild asks: "Why is Chancellor Merkel negotiating with Africa's despots?" in its account of the "tricky Valletta summit". Similarly, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung says the EU's offer of money for fewer refugees from Africa was making critics "accuse the EU of showing its real values by cooperating with unjust regimes". In neighbouring France, Le Figaro urges President Francois Hollande to "have the courage" to drastically cut all kinds of aid for migrants. "In the short term, what is he waiting for to close the Calais 'jungle'... and change the policy against clandestine immigration?" In Russia, state-controlled Channel One TV describes the summit as "another attempt by Europe to stop the chaos", noting that "whilst Europe and Africa are bargaining with each other, thousands are embarking on fatal trips in the Mediterranean". The $1.9bn fund is in addition to the $20bn the EU already spends on development assistance in Africa every year, Mr Tusk said. The fund is also supposed to be boosted by contributions by individual member states, but only a small amount had been pledged. The UN says some 150,000 people from African countries such as Eritrea, Nigeria and Somalia have made the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean. But this has been dwarfed by the arrival of some 650,000 people - mostly Syrians - via Turkey and Greece. There have been more than 3,000 deaths as people try to make the crossing. BBC world affairs reporter Richard Galpin says the crisis has evolved so quickly this year that European leaders have been struggling to keep up and formulate any coherent policies.	The $1.9bn (£1.2bn) European fund to tackle African migration is not sufficient, several African leaders have said after crisis talks with their European counterparts.
Now the business organisation, the CBI, has become the latest civil society group to argue that a restructure is required. This week, the independent unionist MLA John McCallister has tabled a bill in the assembly that proposes big changes to the workings of the devolved parliament and government. The stalled Stormont House Agreement outlined plans for a formal opposition. But Mr McCallister's Assembly and Executive Reform Bill goes much further. He argues that his plans would help to move politics in Northern Ireland away from tribal divisions. "The public mood out there is that people desperately want to see this place working and functional - being about evidence-based policy making," he says. "Being able to change the government is a fundamental right of democracy." Under his plans, parties would have to gain 18 or more seats to be automatically entitled to enter the executive. They would negotiate with each other to agree a Programme for Government before taking up ministerial positions. Any party with fewer than 18 seats would not be excluded from the executive, as they could be included on the basis of the negotiations. But if a party did not agree with the Programme for Government, they would go into an enhanced opposition. First Minister's Questions in the assembly would work more like Prime Minister's Questions at Westminster. There would be a leader and deputy leader of the opposition, likely to be the leaders of the two largest non-executive parties. At least 15 days a year would be set aside for opposition business. Smaller parties could have a bigger say. In the Irish parliament, or DÃ¡il, independents have signed up to a technical group to get improved speaking rights. The Stormont bill proposes a similar system in Northern Ireland, suggesting that six or more MLAs could form a group that would be represented on the committee that decides assembly business. At the moment, 89 out of the 108 MLAs are in the parties that make up the executive. Queen's University Belfast professor Yvonne Galligan, who has carried out studies that have compared democratic institutions, says having an opposition makes more sense to voters. "The government and opposition model is one which is very familiar to people on these islands," she says. "I think that allows people to clearly distinguish between parties and political platforms. "A strong parliament and a strong opposition would help to shore up people's confidence in our democratic institutions." When it comes to critiques of the parliamentary system, Stormont is not alone. Mary Fee MSP, a member of Scottish Labour's shadow cabinet, told me that the Scottish Parliament's means of holding government to account had flaws. She says parliamentary committees should be fewer in number, but have more members, and be given more time to scrutinise legislation. "Committee members should take off their party hats when they go into committee," she says. "That is something that has dogged us. With a majority government, members of the governing party will more often toe the party line and not scrutinise the government." Besides government and opposition, there are other significant measures in Mr McCallister's bill. It would abolish community designation, the system by which MLAs must register as unionist, nationalist, or "other". Currently, 30 signatures on a "petition of concern" will trigger a cross-community vote, under which a majority of unionists and nationalists are necessary for a motion to pass. The bill would replace petitions of concern with another minority protection mechanism - 30 signatures from three parties or groups would be needed to require a motion or bill to have a "weighted majority" - 60% would be the threshold for success. There would also be a new rule for ministers. Collective cabinet responsibility would be written into the ministerial code, in an attempt to stop inter-executive sniping. And instead of having a deputy first minister, there would be two first ministers. Mr McCallister says he has had indications from many of the Stormont parties that they could sign up to "much" of the bill. He acknowledges that some parties may have issues with the proposals to have two first ministers and to abolish community designation. However, the South Down MLA claims that his bill is a "carefully put together package of something which will work and deliver a much more functional assembly and executive". Whether it is passed, in part or in full, will depend on what the assembly's bigger parties make of it. MLAs may hold their first debate on the bill next month. The View is broadcast on BBC One Northern Ireland at 22:35 on Thursday, and is available to watch afterwards on the iPlayer.	"Dysfunctional", "not fit for purpose", "in urgent need of reform" - these are just some of the phrases that politicians themselves have been using about the Stormont system.
Kara McCullough, a scientist at the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, appeared to link healthcare to employment. But the beauty queen, 25, faced a backlash on social media. It comes as the Trump administration battles to overturn Obamacare, which aimed to extend insurance coverage to the 15% of Americans who lack it. Earlier this month the lower chamber of the US Congress passed a new healthcare act that Democrats say will leave millions uninsured. However, Republicans in the Senate have indicated they will cast it aside and write a new law. Asked during Sunday's pageant in Las Vegas whether healthcare was a privilege or a right, Miss McCullough said: "I'm definitely going to say it's a privilege." She added: "As a government employee, I'm granted healthcare and I see first hand that for one to have healthcare, you need to have jobs. "We need to continue to cultivate this environment that we're given the opportunity to have healthcare as well as jobs to all American citizens worldwide." Her remarks divided liberal-minded and conservative-minded viewers. Some were quick to criticise her stance. Miss McCullough - who was born in Italy and was representing Washington DC - was also asked if she considered herself to be a feminist but said she preferred the term "equalism" and said men and women had equal opportunity in US workplaces. "I don't really want to consider myself - try not to consider myself like this die-hard, you know, like, 'Oh, I don't really care about men'," said the contestant, who says she wants to see more women employed in government science roles. Some people on social media supported her views. Obamacare has been opposed by Republicans since it was first proposed in 2009. Republicans say the law imposes too many costs on business and describe it as a "job killer", although the number of jobs in the healthcare sector has risen since it was introduced. Opponents have also decried it as an unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of private businesses and individuals.	The new Miss USA beauty pageant winner has sparked controversy by declaring that healthcare was a "privilege", not a right.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Reds drew 2-2 at the Stadium of Light, less than 44 hours after beating title rivals Manchester City. "I told the players if nobody wanted to play I would never speak about it and not tell anyone, but nobody came. That was a good thing," said Klopp. Match of the Day pundit Martin Keown said: "Klopp looked tired himself." The draw left Liverpool five points behind leaders Chelsea, who visit Tottenham on Wednesday (20:00 GMT). Former Arsenal defender Keown said: "The high-intensity game has taken it out of them but it has been a good half of the season for them." Klopp said he "does not know exactly what I saw" during the draw at the Stadium of Light. Daniel Sturridge and Sadio Mane twice put the Reds ahead, but two Jermain Defoe penalties pegged them back. "I'm not able to explain it," said Klopp. "We can play better football but I'm not sure if you can play better with that break." Klopp made just one change to his starting XI, with forward Sturridge coming in for injured midfielder Jordan Henderson in an altered formation. Liverpool covered a total of 118.63km as a team, outrunning Sunderland, who clocked up 115.89km. That is in keeping with their performances over the rest of the festive period, during which they ran 116.87km in beating Manchester City and 118.94km in their 4-1 win over Stoke on 27 December. Media playback is not supported on this device Sunderland manager David Moyes suggested Klopp would have been widely praised had he been responsible for the home side's tactics. Klopp described the Black Cats as "the most defensive team I ever saw" after his side won the reverse fixture at Anfield 2-0 in November. "Maybe if I was a German manager, you might praise that, actually," said Moyes. "If I had been German, you might have been saying, 'great, you're doing something different'." England striker Sturridge was forced off 10 minutes from full-time on his first Premier League start since October. However, Klopp is hopeful the 27-year-old, who has scored six goals in 14 club appearances this season, will be back sooner rather than later. "He got a knock on his right ankle. I don't think it's too bad," said Klopp. Sturridge has had a series of injuries since signing from Chelsea in January 2013, including hip and thigh problems.	Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says he gave his players the chance to opt out of Monday's match at Sunderland if they were too tired - but nobody wanted to.
Four officers were injured when the Met's Flying Squad swooped on the men in Piccadilly at 11:25 BST. A Taser was discharged several times and the policemen were hurt as the men tried to escape on mopeds. Four men have been arrested and are being held at London police stations. A Met Police spokesman said three officers suffered minor injuries and the fourth is in hospital in a serious condition. Store owner Avi Reed said the gang smashed a glass cabinet, causing more than Â£300,000 of damage, Mr Reed said police contacted them at the Chronext store earlier to warn them that there might be a robbery, and the shop was closed to protect customers. He said: "At about 11:30 we saw three guys, they had helmets on. One tried to smash the door with a hammer. The glass didn't break as it's protected but he managed to get in. "Another guy had an axe and managed to smash a cabinet, while the other stayed on the motorbike. They caused enormous damage." Mr Reed praised the actions of the "amazing" police. Det Supt Craig Turner, said: "Our officers are absolutely committed to keeping London safe and target the criminals who pose a danger to Londoners and our city businesses day in, day out. "They know that this work carries with it very real risks and dangers but take this in their stride as part of serving the public. "However, today's events highlight how the reckless behaviour of those determined to evade justice, heedless of the consequences, can have a real impact on all those involved." Piccadilly was closed eastbound at Hyde Park Corner for about six hours while investigations were carried out.	A moped gang armed with knives and an axe has been intercepted by police in a "terrifying" attempt to rob a luxury watch store in central London.
With a television audience of 110 million, it's one of the biggest platforms in the world - and Gaga has been putting in the hours to ensure her set is suitably spectacular. "We were [rehearsing] in the tent for about a week and a half, then we had to move to bigger studios in Hollywood where we are working on the rest of the show," she told Houston radio station Mix 96.5. "And then we will send that equipment to Houston where we will finish rehearsals. Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far." She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: "Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mikeâ€¦ BOOM! "And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up andâ€¦ BLAM! BORN TO RUN!" It led to the memorable headline: "America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds. Coldplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce. She only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement. Some of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring "Justice 4 Mario Woods" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier. The performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year. You can't out-diva Diana, something she was determined to prove when she strode onto the pitch in Tempe, Arizona, for Super Bowl XXX. She raced through 10 songs and four costume changes in 12 minutes, then jumped into a helicopter and fled the stadium. Which is one way to beat the post-game traffic. For the first few decades, the Super Bowl half-time performance featured marching bands, drill teams and Disney's mouseketeers. 1987's show was altogether more bizarre. A magician named "Elvis Presto" burst out of a jukebox, before performing a series of conjuring tricks, aided by 2,000 part-time dancers, 102 custom Harley Davidson motorcycles and some of rock's biggest classics. At the culmination of the show, the "Prince of Prestidigitation" performed an interactive magic trick ("pick a card, concentrate real hard") while viewers at home watched through 3D glasses. It was cheesier than a wheel of brie - and prompted the NFL to adopt a more modern approach. She arrived on a mechanical tiger, and departed on a shooting star - but Katy Perry couldn't compete with the infamous "left shark". He was one of two foam-suited dancers flanking Katy while she performed Teenage Dream. While the one on the right was forgettable, the left shark flailed around in a desperate attempt to remember his dance moves. It quickly became a viral sensation, spawning a whole range of merchandise from the ever-savvy pop star. And when the half-time show was nominated for an Emmy, Katy made sure to thank her faithful friend. Poor old Janet Jackson. She was at the end of a triumphant, hit-laden medley when Justin Timberlake ripped the front off her bodice, revealing a heavily-bejewelled superboob. Few ever believed that the "wardrobe malfunction" was indeed a malfunction - but if you look at the photographs taken immediately after the event, Jackson appears mortified (notably, these were not the pictures printed by the press). Nonetheless, America went apoplectic. The Federal Complaints Commission reportedly got more than 200,000 complaints, while Janet was blacklisted by MTV and radio. Her career never fully recovered. But there is a bright side to this story. A PayPal employee called Jawed Karim missed the half-time show and grew frustrated that he couldn't watch the incident online. In response, he and his friends Steve Chen and Chad Hurley began coding a website where people could upload their own content. That site would end up being YouTube.

Born in Bradford, Appleyard did not make his first-class debut until he was 27, but took 200 wickets in his first season in 1951. He made his Test debut in 1954 and had match figures of 7-123 in a victory over Pakistan at Trent Bridge. Appleyard retired from playing in 1958 and went on to serve a two-year term as club president between 2006 and 2008. During his career, he took 642 wickets at an average of 15.42 for Yorkshire, and 31 in nine Tests for England. Appleyard was named as one of  Wisden's cricketers of the year in 1952 and appointed an MBE in 2007.	Former Yorkshire and England off-spinner Bob Appleyard MBE has died at the age of 90.
The announcement follows last week's warning that a vast area of China would be badly hit by pollution. Beijing saw its second red alert over the weekend. The latest wave of alerts includes the industrial port Tianjin. Red alerts trigger advisories for people to stay inside, schools to stop classes, and restrict vehicle use. An environmental ministry statement issued on  Wednesday night said the 10 cities with red alerts include Tianjin as well as smaller surrounding cities Puyang, Xinxiang, Dezhou, Handan, Xintai, Langfang, Hengshui, Xinji and Anyang. They are among 30 cities including Beijing seeing "severe pollution". Another 20 cities have "heavy pollution". The latest news was met with resignation, and even some jokes, by Chinese netizens who have endured bad air quality levels in recent weeks. On Wednesday, images of  a purple-tinged sunset in Nanjing spread across social media with many users attributing it to the pollution in the city. "New type of haze: grape flavoured," joked Weibo user Chenyingshisupoman. Another Weibo user Diliutianmaoxianjia said sarcastically: "Compared to the heavy smog of Beijing, the strong smog of Hebei, and damp heat of Shanghai, I prefer the colours of Nanjing's smog... it is durable and refreshing... once you breathe it in it sticks to your heart." Beijing's second red alert ended on Tuesday night. The ministry said the capital's air quality was "slowly improving". But some parts of neighbouring Henan and Hebei regions were still seeing heavy pollution, with levels of the PM2.5 pollutant surpassing 300 mg per cubic metre - the hazardous level in China. China has seen extremely high levels of air pollution in recent years, particularly in the coal-reliant north east, the industrial heart of the country. Following criticism that authorities were not doing enough to protect citizens' health, the government has stepped up in issuing health advisories and promised to take action to address pollution.	Hazardous smog blanketing China's north-east has sparked more red alerts, with authorities advising residents in 10 cities to stay indoors.
Vardy, 29, has not scored for the champions since 10 September - a run of 14 games - but netted in England's 2-2 friendly draw with Spain last week. His form is in stark contrast to a year ago, when he scored for a record 11th Premier League game in a row. "He has restarted and is very close to scoring," said Ranieri. "He has started to also score in training, and that is good news because also, in the training, he didn't score so well." Vardy has scored twice in the league this season compared with 13 at the same stage in 2015-16. He finished last season with 28 goals in 48 appearances for club and country. Since his last club goal, the Foxes have slipped to 14th in the table with just two wins in nine matches. Ranieri believes Vardy and team-mate Riyad Mahrez no longer boast the "surprise" factor that worked in their favour last season. The Italian said: "That is the big problem. Jamie is always normal, the same last season. You don't see him nervous or frustrated. "But sooner or later Vardy will come back. I speak every day with him. He is very calm, very concentrated in his job, to work for the team." Leicester, who have qualified from their Champions League group with a game to spare, host Middlesbrough in the Premier League on Saturday (15:00 GMT).	Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri has backed Jamie Vardy to end his goal drought, but revealed the striker has even struggled to score in training.
In his first prime-time speech on a specific policy issue, the Republican leader will address the nation at 21:00 local time (01:00 GMT). He said he had reached a decision after reviewing war options with his national security team at Camp David. Mr Trump once called for a full US pullout from Afghanistan. He announced a strategic review soon after taking office in January. So what can the president do when he addresses the nation? Option 1: He could pull out all 8,400 US troops and let the Afghans get on with it. That could be popular at home and would be consistent with what Donald Trump has previously said. But it would leave a dangerous vacuum to be filled not just by Afghan rebels, but also by embryonic Islamic State affiliates which are taking hold in the east of the country. Option 2: He could pull out a large number of US troops and deploy private contractors to continue the work of advising and assisting the Afghan military, in effect outsourcing the job. That's not likely to be popular with the Afghan government, and Washington would still get the blame if things did not work out. Option 3: And this seems the more likely one. He could send more troops (up to 4,000 the best guess) to bolster the training of more Afghan security forces and perhaps add to the American special forces who are involved in the fight to expel IS related groups. Whatever he decides, analysts will be looking for something that amounts to a strategy and not just a change in tactics and that will probably have to involve drawing other countries in the region, such as Pakistan and Russia, into the discussion. He will deliver his first major national security address at a military base next to Arlington National Cemetery, where many of the 2,200 US troops who have died fighting over 16 years of war in Afghanistan are buried. Mr Trump is also expected to outline a more aggressive US counter-terrorism policy for Afghanistan and Pakistan. Earlier this year, the president empowered Defence Secretary Jim Mattis to set troop levels in Afghanistan. General John Nicholson, the top US military commander in the country, has requested some 4,000 additional US forces. He told Afghan troops at a training base southeast of Kabul on Sunday: "We are with you and we will stay with you." US combat operations against the Taliban officially ended in 2014, but special forces have continued to provide support to Afghan troops. Current US troop numbers in Afghanstan are about 8,400. The Afghan government continues to battle insurgency groups and controls just half of the country. Mr Trump has previously supported pulling troops out of the conflict, which began under President George W Bush in 2001 after the 9/11 attacks. "I took over a mess, and we're going to make it a lot less messy," Mr Trump said when asked about Afghanistan earlier this month. End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrump End of Twitter post 2 by @realDonaldTrump "We're not winning," he told advisers in a meeting in July. His defence secretary has argued a US military presence is necessary to fight off threats from Islamist militants. Mr Mattis visited Afghanistan over the weekend, saying he was satisfied with the administration's new strategy. Former White House strategic adviser Steve Bannon had called for the withdrawal of all US forces, arguing the war was unwinnable. But he was fired by the president on Friday.	US President Donald Trump is expected to indicate later that he is sending more troops to Afghanistan, prolonging a war-weary America's longest conflict.
The 79-year-old West Ham chairman was sent a tweet by a prankster, asking to spread awareness of a "missing" Hammers fan. Gold obliged, only for the fan to turn out to be West Ham winger Michail Antonio. Antonio, 25, cost the Hammers £7m when he arrived from Nottingham Forest on transfer deadline day - but he has made just one appearance for Slaven Bilic's team, coming on as a substitute in the 2-1 win at Manchester City on 19 September. Gold has since deleted the tweet, but the prankster has pinned a screen grab to the top of his Twitter timeline. The lesson - think before you retweet.	David Gold thought he was doing a good deed, but instead was found guilty of not recognising one of his own players.

St James' Park and West Ham United's ground were raided in April by HM Revenue and Customs as part of a Â£5m National Insurance fraud investigation. Newcastle's managing director Lee Charnley was among several men arrested and later released without charge. The ban remains in force until a court hearing on 22 June. High Court judge Mr Justice Supperstone imposed the ban after lawyers for Newcastle United applied for a judicial review against HMRC. He directed that any material retained by HMRC must be returned to the club. He also directed that the legal action involving the Magpies, who have just secured promotion to the Premier League, must return to court on 22 June. It is expected the club will then have to show that it has an arguable case to take to a full judicial review hearing. No details of the grounds of the challenge were revealed during Thursday's short court hearing. Lawyers for both the club and HMRC said they could not provide any further information. During the raids HMRC said it had seized business records and financial records as well as computers and mobile phones.	Tax officials have been banned from examining material seized from Newcastle United's ground, following a legal challenge mounted by the club.
Lizzie Mould, from Bristol University, was challenged by Gloucestershire firm Snow Business to come up with a "green" realistic snow for film and television. It took her two years and a "few hundred attempts" but now her new snow liquids are being sold to the industry. Ms Mould, said: "To say that seeing the products on the market is rewarding would be an understatement." The Stroud-based company which specialises in fake snow and ice effects, has previously worked on James Bond film Spectre, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens. But in a bid to create a "really good snow effect" which was "robust in different climates", environmentally friendly and would not damage people's skin or leave a residue - they approached the university. "I must have made hundreds of formulations. before we got to where we are today," said Ms Mould, who has now been offered a full-time job with the firm. "The original plan was just to make one fluid but by the end of my project we had two which both worked really well." Recently launched to the industry, Paul Denney, from the company, said as far as they know the new liquids are "the most environmentally friendly falling snow products in the world". "We had looked at developing the product ourselves but the chemistry involved was beyond our capabilities, which is why we approached the University of Bristol," he said. "We weren't totally sure what Lizzie would be able to do, especially as we had a long wish list of characteristics but she's really come up trumps and surpassed all our expectations."	A chemistry student has created "the most environmentally-friendly" fake snow, as part of her research.
It began just before 14:00 GMT at the property in Grove Lane on the outskirts of Elmswell, near Bury St Edmunds. Progress at the scene has been "slow due to the weather conditions", Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service said. Nine crews remained at the property into the evening, removing the thatch and damping down hot spots. At its peak 16 crews attended the blaze. The cause of the fire is not yet known.	A fire has ripped through the first floor of a thatched house in a Suffolk village.
United, who registered only one shot on target, fell behind when Alejandro Dominguez diverted home Giannis Maniatis's effort before the break. Arsenal loanee Joel Campbell's precise shot doubled the lead and the visitors only came to life late on. Robin van Persie blazed over the top when they finally opened up the Greeks. It would have been an injustice to the hosts had the Dutchman converted his late chance, however, after United's current limitations were exposed on a chastening night. Olympiakos lead the Greek Super League by 20 points, having won 24 of 26 games, in sharp contrast to their opponents' increasingly forlorn Premier League title defence. And, after reverses for Manchester City and Arsenal last week, the Greeks inflicted the third defeat of the round for English sides. Olympiakos manager Michel had suggested before kick-off that United, whose best hope of passage into next year's Champions League appeared to be winning this season's competition, could fold under the pressure of knockout football. The visitors, who were famously eliminated by Galatasaray in a similarly white-hot atmosphere in Istanbul in 1993, certainly fuelled the noisy home fans' enthusiasm with some early defensive wobbles. Media playback is not supported on this device After Rio Ferdinand had misplaced a couple of passes, a last-ditch challenge from Nemanja Vidic only just ended Dominguez's run after he had advanced into the area unchallenged. Dominguez continued to orchestrate Olympiakos's attacks from an advanced midfield role and with Juan Mata cup-tied, Adnan Januzaj left out of the match-day squad and Rooney frustrated by the referee and his own performance, the visitors lacked a similarly commanding figure. So it was fitting that it was the Argentine who opened the scoring. Maniatis's trundling low shot posed little danger to United goalkeeper David De Gea, but Dominguez's outstretched foot cleverly diverted the ball into the opposite corner giving the Spaniard too much ground to make up. United, who had lacked energy and invention, showed slightly more purpose before the break, but could not create any clear-cut chances, goalkeeper Roberto dealing competently with the visitors' crosses. The last time that Manchester United overturned a two-goal deficit in Europe was when they beat Diego Maradona's Barcelona 3-0 at Old Trafford in March 1984 in the quarter-finals of the Cup Winners' Cup. David Moyes's half-time team-talk needed to focus players' minds and change their tactics but neither was in evidence as Tom Cleverley knocked the ball out of play under no pressure soon after kick-off. A goal down, the visitors had no room for further error and Campbell's superb curling effort, after he slipped Michael Carrick's flimsy challenge, threatened to cut them adrift in the tie. Moyes introduced Shinji Kagawa and Danny Welbeck at the expense of Antonio Valencia and Cleverley, but it did little to change the momentum. Michael Olaitan sent a shot fizzing just over as the hosts revelled in the space and uncertainty in United's defence. Only in the final 10 minutes were United able to bring any pressure to bear, but, after two measured touches had given him a clear sight of goal, Van Persie crashed over the top with his weaker right foot from Chris Smalling's cross. It summed up a miserable new episode in Moyes's faltering first season in charge.	Manchester United's Champions League campaign is in serious peril after they were comfortably beaten by Olympiakos in the last-16 first leg in Athens.
The hosts were on course for the second highest chase in women's Twenty20 internationals before rain intervened. Sarah Taylor (66) top-scored in England's 156-6 but Dane van Niekerk hit 63 as South Africa reached 145-3 when the match was called off. England, who had never lost a T20 to South Africa before this match, dropped Van Nierkerk on 6 and 22. Van Nierkerk's 63 came off 43 balls, hitting seven fours and two sixes, as she put on 68 with captain Mignon du Preez. That partnership took South Africa to 98-1, but Du Preez scored 47 not out and Marizanne Kapp 21 to take South Africa home. England will rue their missed chances in the South Africa innings when a sloppy fielding performance saw them drop a number of catches, leak runs and miss run-out chances. Taylor scored 66 from 52 balls for England, with eight fours, her second half-century of the series after her unbeaten 74 in England's win in Paarl. Taylor had partnerships of 63 with Heather Knight (29) and 61 with captain Charlotte Edwards (34) but England struggled to kick on in the latter overs. Despite late hitting from Danielle Wyatt, who scored 17 not out, England lost two wickets to run-outs in the final over in which they scored just four runs. England captain Charlotte Edwards: "I thought we batted well and that should have been enough. We were undone by a brilliant innings by Van Niekerk and dropped catches cost us. "We let ourselves down a little bit, but Dane really took the attack to us. We must take our chances." South Africa captain Mignon Du Preez: "We knew that we had the firepower in the line-up, even though we had to go at eight an over. The momentum is with us so we're looking forward to a very competitive game at the Wanderers." Dane van Niekerk: "I enjoyed myself at the top of the order. I did things differently than yesterday and it came up. I'm hitting the ball well." Former England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent: "England bowled poorly and dropped catches and weren't up to standard. If they play at their best they will be fine because they have talented players such as Sarah Taylor, but they need to work on their game for the World Twenty20." Both sides travel to the Wanderers for Sunday's series decider which gets underway at 8:00 GMT. Sunday's match is both teams' last before the World Twenty20 in India which starts on 15 March, with England beginning their campaign against Bangladesh in Bangalore on 17 March.	South Africa beat England by 17 runs on the Duckworth-Lewis method to level the Twenty20 series with one game to go.
Oliver Hawkins turned in from six yards to put the Daggers ahead, before Matty Blair's strike and Adi Yussuf's left-footed finish gave the Stags the lead. Pearce was sent off and conceded a penalty for tripping Jamie Cureton, but the striker fired over from the spot. Matt Green slotted in for Mansfield, and the visitors could not rescue a point despite Cureton's late goal. Dagenham & Redbridge coach Ian Culverhouse told BBC Radio London: Media playback is not supported on this device "I thought we were excellent first half. Controlled the game in good parts, scored a well-deserved goal and went into the half deserved winners. "It's a bit of a blow really to come out on the wrong side of it.

Polish national Daria Pionko, 21, was found in Springwell Road, Holbeck, at about 01:30 GMT on Wednesday. Police said Miss Pionko, who had been living in Leeds, was a sex worker. She was taken to hospital for treatment, but died a short time later. A 38-year-old man was arrested in connection with the incident. Miss Pionko had been found unconscious with injuries consistent with an assault, West Yorkshire Police said. Officers found her in a defined managed area where sex workers operate during set hours, the force said. The force appealed for witnesses to come forward and in particular anyone who was in the Springwell Road area between 20:00 Tuesday and about 01:30 Wednesday.	A woman who died after being found seriously injured in Leeds, sparking a murder inquiry, has been named by police.
The 27-year-old man from Blackburn was riding a grey Triumph Daytona motorcycle along the B6479 near Selside when he crashed at 19:25 BST on Wednesday.

A motorbiker has died after hitting a sign at the side of the road in North Yorkshire.
Police now have a DNA profile for the mother of the girl whose bones were discovered by a member of the public at Washlands nature reserve in Wakefield. Forensic analysis of the remains suggest they had been left in the area some time before October 2015. A post-mortem examination was inconclusive, police said. Live updates on this story and others from around Yorkshire The bones were found in a blue plastic bag wrapped in a pair of dark leggings or trousers, which had a drawstring at the waist and were from Matalan, police said. They were discovered just off a towpath leading from Welbeck Lane on 3 May last year. West Yorkshire Police said it was believed the baby was born at full term. Det Ch Insp Nicola Bryar, from the homicide and major inquiry team, said the DNA profile of the mother meant several people had been ruled out of the inquiry. She said: "Twelve months on we continue to appeal for the mother of this baby to come forward. "While she may not require medical assistance, she will have suffered deep trauma and may very well be in need of some counselling and professional emotional support."	A plea has been made to trace the mother of a baby whose remains were found in a plastic bag at a nature reserve a year ago.
Leading F1 commercial figure Zak Brown has been contacted by McLaren as the company seeks a replacement. Dennis has been told by the two parties that own 75% of McLaren Group that his contract will not be renewed for 2017. But Brown, a 44-year-old American, is also considered a potential chief commercial officer for F1's new owners. The US media group Liberty is in the process of buying a controlling interest in the sport's commercial arm from investment group CVC Capital Partners. The deal is expected to be completed early next year. Brown is of particular interest to McLaren because of his success in finding new sponsors for a number of teams on the grid in his former role as boss of the marketing agency JMI, from which he resigned in September. McLaren have not had a title sponsor since parting company with mobile phone company Vodafone at the end of 2013. Ironically, McLaren have had a major success in recent weeks in securing a new partnership deal for BP/Castrol to become their fuel and lubricant supplier. The deal has been signed but has not yet been announced. The company will replace Exxon Mobil, which has been poached by Red Bull for next season after 21 years with McLaren. That deal is expected to be announced imminently. The three names revealed by BBC Sport over the US Grand Prix weekend - ex-F1 team bosses Ross Brawn, Martin Whitmarsh and former Sainsbury's boss Justin King - remain of interest to McLaren and have been contacted by the team. But all three are now considered unlikely to take on the position. They may be unwilling to put themselves forward or it may be decided they are not the best person for the role. It is also possible Dennis, who is chairman and chief executive officer and has been in charge at McLaren for 35 years, would be replaced by two different people, as would be a more conventional company structure. Brown is friendly with all the main shareholders at McLaren, including Dennis. But BBC Sport understands that the Bahrainis and Ojjeh are now reaching out to him as they seek a new man to run the company. If McLaren can persuade him to take the role, it would be something of a coup for the team, since it has long been known that Brown has been favourite for the commercial head of F1 job at Liberty Media. Despite the ultimatum by his fellow shareholders, Dennis has been telling friends and confidants that he will decide when or if he will step down, not anyone else. But it is far from clear that he is in a position to make that decision. If his contract is not renewed, he would remain a 25% shareholder but would probably have no active role or power in running the company. Dennis will fight hard to retain his position as the head of McLaren, despite the fracturing of relationships between him on the one hand and Ojjeh and the Bahrainis on the other. He has run the company since 1981 and has become synonymous with McLaren, which he has built up into one of the sport's most successful teams, as well as launching a road-car company that sells high-end supercars. Dennis had been trying to find investment to enable him to buy a controlling shareholding in McLaren Group. He did have an agreement with Ojjeh and Mumtalakat that he could buy sufficient shares to take him over over 50% were he to find that investment. Dennis found two separate Chinese groups of investors. One was on the verge of completing a deal with Dennis before a weakening of the Chinese economy caused the arrangement to collapse. He then sourced a second group of Chinese investors and took them to Ojjeh and Mumtalkat, who refused to sell their shares because they did not want to grant Dennis so much power in the company.	A surprise new name has emerged as a potential successor to long-standing McLaren boss Ron Dennis, whose position as chairman is under threat.
A group chaired by Paralympic multi-gold medallist Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson says it would be the first country in the world to take that step. It would mean more time for sport, but unions worry too many core curriculum subjects could dilute their importance. The Welsh government said it would consider the recommendation. Education Minister Leighton Andrews said he wanted to look into how schools can increase levels of physical activity in children and young people. By Arwyn JonesBBC Wales education correspondent Although the need for more exercise is clear enough, it isn't just a simple matter of adding PE as a core subject. Pupils in Wales already have as core subjects Welsh, English, maths and sciences. They are the areas the government has decided should have most time and resources allocated to them. And teaching unions fear the more you add to that core, the less of a priority they each become. More than one-third are either overweight or obese, costing the Welsh NHS more than £70m a year. The current core subjects in schools in Wales are English, Welsh (as a first language), mathematics, and science, while physical education is a foundation subject. Having PE elevated to a core part of the curriculum would mean more time devoted to it, as well as extra resources and more training for teachers. Schools would also need to give greater priority to provision for PE. As a result: • Teachers would be required to be competent to deliver the subject on completion of their initial teacher training. • Well qualified, specialist teachers would be needed to work with schools to ensure high-quality provision. • Standards and provision in physical education would be rigorously reviewed in school, both by the educational consortia and by schools inspectorate Estyn. • Progress would be regularly measured. The move to give PE more status in schools would be a bold move but an important one, according to the group. In its report, the group, which also included the chair of Sports Wales Laura McAllister, said: "Given the Welsh government's commitment to making physical literacy as important a development skill as reading and writing, the group felt that changing the status of physical education is the only credible and secure way of ensuring this." But while teaching unions support the idea, they are worried that too many subjects on the core curriculum could dilute their importance. Dr Philip Dixon, director of ATL Cymru, said it was important to decide on "what small core we want". "We certainly want literacy and numeracy in there," he said. "We may well want physical education in there too, that's for the government to decide. "But the core has to be kept very small or else we'll see a core which isn't a core and that's just ridiculous." Owen Hathway, Wales policy officer at the NUT, also warned that schools already had a heavy curriculum in Wales. "We are constantly being told that literacy and numeracy is a priority, " he said. "Science is being pushed as a priority with its importance to future PISA testing. We have the core subjects of maths, English, Welsh and so on already in place, while IT is also being promoted as a priority. "Quite simply, by the nature of the word, not everything can be a priority." Responding to the report, Education Minister Leighton Andrews said he would be considering the report in the context of the wider review of the national curriculum and assessment. "We firmly believe in the positive impact that physical activity can have on the people and nation of Wales and I'm determined to ensure that sport continues to make an important contribution to Welsh life," he added. Sport Minister John Griffiths said sport was important as it improves health and wellbeing, along with helping with team building and making friends. "We are committed to widening access and encouraging greater participation in physical activity as the health benefits of making physical exercise a part of everyone's daily lives is well-understood," he added.	PE should be given the same status as maths, English, science and Welsh in schools to help tackle obesity in Wales, experts have recommended.
