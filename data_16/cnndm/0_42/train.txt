(CNN) -- World No. 3 Kim Clijsters remains on course to win a second consecutive grand slam singles title after overcoming a challenge from Agnieszka Radwanska to reach the semifinals of the Australian Open. The U.S. Open champion battled past 12th seed Radwanska of Poland 6-3 7-6 (7-4) in Wednesday's quarterfinal to reach the last four in Melbourne for the sixth time in her career. The Belgian third seed will face world No. 2 Vera Zvonareva on Thursday for a place in the final -- a repeat of September's title clash at Flushing Meadows. Zvonareva, runner-up at the last two grand slams after also losing to Serena Williams in the Wimbledon final, took just over an hour to dispatch of Czech 25th seed Petra Kvitova 6-2 6-4. Top 10 moments of the Australian Open first week . The Russian second seed was full of praise for her 20-year-old Czech opponent, who knocked out home favorite and world number five Sam Stosur on her way to her second grand slam quarterfinal, matching her feat at Wimbledon in 2010. "At 6-2 3-0 I was trying to keep playing the same way I was playing, but she really lifted her game," the 26-year-old Zvonareva told reporters. "She's a very good player. She took that opportunity, that little chance I gave her, and used it to get back into the match. I'm happy with the way I handled the situation during those moments, though." Clijsters, meanwhile, faced arguably her toughest test so far in world No. 14 Radwanska, who was playing in her first tournament for three months following a foot injury. But despite losing a 4-1 lead in the first set and going down a break of serve early in the second, the more experienced Clijsters closed out the match to make the semifinals in Australia for the first time since her brief period of retirement from the game in 2008. "I felt a little bit tired and heavy out there today, but I fought well and stayed really focused, and tried not to lose too much energy on getting frustrated," the mother-of-one told the official WTA Tour website. The 27-year-old admitted that she would have to improve in order to add the Australian Open title to the three grand slam singles crowns she has already won in New York in 2005, 2009 and 2010. "Everything has to be better. The serving, the returning, the unforced errors -- everything. But I'm in the semifinals and I don't feel I've played my best tennis, so that's a good thing," she said. "I'm hanging in there. Sometimes it's more of an achievement than winning your matches very easily." In Thursday's other semifinal, world number one Caroline Wozniacki will play Chinese ninth seed Li Na after the pair both won their quarterfinal matches on Tuesday. Denmark's Wozniacki is attempting to claim her first major title, while Na -- who also reached the last four in Melbourne last year -- hopes to become the first woman from her country to reach a grand slam final.

By . Sami Mokbel . Follow @@SamiMokbel81_DM . West Ham are contemplating a move for Monaco striker Lacina Traore as fears grow over Andy Carroll's fitness. The England striker has sustained an ankle injury on the club's tour of New Zealand causing him to miss Wednesday morning's 2-1 defeat to Wellington. And manager Sam Allardyce is giving serious consideration to signing another centre forward amid concerns over his £15million man. Goalscorer: Lacina Traore celebrates scoring on his Everton debut against Swansea . More firepower: Sam Allardyce is considering a move for Traore following Andy Carroll's fitness struggles . Traore is among the names on West Ham's potential shortlist ahead of the new season. The 6ft 8in striker nearly joined the Hammers in January, but the Ivory Coast star opted to join Everton on loan instead. He scored on his debut for the Toffees against Swansea in the FA Cup on February 16, but sustained a hamstring injury six days later in the warm-up ahead of a clash with Chelsea and missed the rest of the season. Monaco are willing to let the striker, who could also be a target for Everton, leave this summer - a development West Ham are aware of. World class: Traore during a friendly ahead of the World Cup with the Ivory Coast . Star signing: He might have cost West Ham £15million but Carroll's injury problems make him unreliable . Carroll's time at Upton Park has been beset by injury problems, and his latest set-back has led to fears over his long-term fitness ahead of the new season. He made just 16 appearances for the club last season owing to a serious heel injury. West Ham insist he is not expected to miss the start of the new campaign, but Allardyce knows he can ill-afford another year without a proven centre forward to lead his attack. Carroll's injury problems, and his lack of options up front, played a key factor in the club's disappointing 2013/14 campaign - with the Hammers even playing without a recognised centre-forward for some matches. But Allardyce, who has completed deals for forwards Mauro Zarate and Enner Valencia, does not want to fall into the same trap next season and is weighing up a move for a new hitman. Considering his options: Sam Allardyce doesn't want a repeat of last season's no-striker problems .	Roberto Martinez is also considered a move for 6ft 8in frontman . Carroll picked up an ankle injury during training on New Zealand tour . The £15million man's fitness struggles last season remain a concern .

Released: Andy and Tracey Ferrie at the Belvoir hunt ball in March 2006 . The couple arrested for opening fire on intruders who targeted their isolated cottage will not face charges, the Crown Prosecution Service announced last night. Andy and Tracey Ferrie had been held on suspicion of grievous bodily harm after dialling 999 to report that they had discharged a shotgun when a four-man gang broke in to their home in the middle of the night. The couple spent almost three days and nights in custody until they were released on bail late on Tuesday night. Yesterday, hours after two men appeared in court charged with burglary in connection with the raid on the Ferries’ 200-year-old cottage, prosecutors said it was ‘clear’ the couple ‘did what they believed was necessary to protect themselves, and their home, from intruders’. The decision was greeted as a victory for common sense by friends and relatives. Mrs Ferrie’s mother, Hazel Towell, and her husband, John, called for a change in the law to give greater protection to property owners who defended their homes from intruders. Mr Towell, 62, said: ‘It is terrifying, what happened to them. ‘What else could they have done? I feel so overjoyed the charges have been dropped. ‘Her mother has the weight off her shoulders. ‘This is the way forward. Police should have common sense.’ When asked about the people who raided his stepdaughter’s home, Mr Towell had previously told the Daily Mail he would have ‘blown their bloody heads off’. Judith Walker, chief crown prosecutor for CPS East Midlands, said the department had advised Leicestershire Police to release Mr and Mrs Ferrie from their bail. Scroll down for video . Analysis: Leicestershire Police cordoned off the stone cottage, which had reportedly been burgled several times already . Taking notes: Police were first called to the property shortly after midnight on September 2, by homeowner Mr Ferrie . Mrs Walker said: ‘I am satisfied that . this is a case where householders, faced with intruders in frightening . circumstances, acted in reasonable self-defence.’ Relatives said Mr Ferrie, who runs a . caravan repair business, and his wife, a saleswoman, were being looked . after by police at an unknown location as detectives remained at their . home at Welby, outside Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, last night. A friend of the couple, who set up a Facebook support group after the shooting which had topped 18,000 members last night, said she was ‘relieved’. Homeowners: Andy and Tracey Ferrie were at their Leicestershire home when a group broke in to the property. They have been told they will not face charges after the intruders were shot . She added: ‘If masked intruders go . into somebody’s bedroom in the middle of the night then the householder . has every right to defend themselves.’ At Loughborough Magistrates Court yesterday, Daniel Mansell, 33, admitted burgling the Ferries’ rented home.

Pawned: David James Montgomery, 58, pawned a laptop with a CD containing 14 homemade pornographic videos of him and a young girl . A Maryland man faces charges after child pornography was found on a CD left in a laptop he pawned, authorities say. On September 10, David James Montgomery, 58, of Hagerstown, pawned a laptop with a CD containing 14 homemade pornographic videos of a preteen girl. Montgomery was arrested Thursday and is charged with possession of child pornography, soliciting a subject for child pornography, permitting a subject to take part in child pornography, and child pornography depicting a sex act, according to Washington County District Court records. If found guilty, Montgomery could spend 35 years in prison, the total maximum sentence for the four charges. The Herald-Mail Media reports that a pawn shop employee found the CD in Montgomery's laptop and 'expected it to be music.' He then played it in another computer and saw that the CD contained a video of Montgomery 'directing a young girl to do sexual things.' Police began to investigate Montgomery after being called to the Washington Street Pawnbrokers in Hagerstown and, after investigating the incident, authorities obtained a search warrant for Montgomery's residence where they reportedly found other media and discs. Montgomery turned himself in and admitted to making the videos but said that he never had physical contact with the girl nor did he share the videos which were all allegedly recorded August 2. Montgomery reportedly told investigators that he had forgotten he left the videos on his computer. Admitted: Montgomery admitted to making the videos but said that he never had physical contact with the young girl nor did he share any of the videos . Herald-Mail reports that the preteen victim has been interviewed by police and Montgomery could face additional felony charges when the grand jury reconvenes.

Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- A South African military plane crashed in the mountains as it headed to an airport near the rural hometown of Nelson Mandela, authorities said Thursday. A military spokesman declined to comment on the plane's mission or the number of people aboard, but said rescuers are searching for survivors. Local media reported that the plane, which had taken off from a Pretoria airbase Wednesday night, was carrying a team of doctors responsible for the former president's health care. However, two sources close to Mandela said the passengers aboard the plane were not doctors for the anti-apartheid icon. Rescue crews found the wreckage around the Drakensberg mountains, but it is too early to tell what happened, said Siphiwe Dlamini, the spokesman for the defense department. It was headed to an airport in Mthatha, the spokesman said. The small town is about 20 miles (30 kilometers) from the Qunu village where Mandela now lives. Mandela, 94, has not appeared in public since the 2010 World Cup hosted by South Africa. The former president gets round-the-clock care after abdominal surgery this year and an acute respiratory infection in 2011. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate spent 27 years in prison for fighting against oppression of blacks in South Africa. He became the nation's first black president in 1994, four years after he was freed from prison. Despite his rare appearances, Mandela retains his popularity and is considered a hero of democracy in the nation. CNN's Robyn Curnow contributed from South Africa and Faith Karimi from Atlanta .

(CNN) -- Last August, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an ultimatum: Food manufacturers had one year to make sure any "gluten-free" products met FDA requirements. That deadline is up. To use the "gluten-free" label, products must now have an undetectable level of gluten and cannot have any ingredient containing wheat, rye, barley, or any their derivatives. If manufacturers continue to use the "gluten-free" label without bringing their food up to scratch, they will be subject to regulatory action from the FDA. (Some foods, such as pasta, may still be on shelves legally for a while if they were produced before the ruling.) A gluten-free diet is the only medically accepted treatment for those who suffer from celiac disease, although gluten-free is increasingly become a popular diet choice for those who don't have the condition. There are approximately 3 million people in the United States who have celiac disease, and even a small amount of gluten can cause damage in their bodies. Some doctors also believe people can be sensitive to gluten or have a gluten intolerance, which is not as severe. Is gluten-free food a joke? Gluten is a protein complex found in grains such as wheat, barley and rye. It is typically what gives foods made with these products their chewiness and elasticity. It is pervasive through so many food products, it can be a challenge to steer clear. The new labeling protocols should eliminate uncertainty for consumers, the FDA says. "Without a standardized definition of 'gluten-free,' these consumers could never really be sure if their body would tolerate a food with that label," Andrea Levario, executive director of the American Celiac Disease Alliance, said in a statement. Federal regulations stipulate that the "gluten-free" label means that the product contains fewer than 20 parts per million of gluten. This measure is the lowest amount scientists can consistently detect in a food. A product labeled "gluten-free" also can't contain any of the following: . â€¢ An ingredient that is any type of wheat, rye, barley or a crossbreed of these grains. â€¢ An ingredient derived from these grains that has not been processed to remove gluten. â€¢ An ingredient derived from these grains that has been processed to remove gluten if it results in the food still containing 20 or more parts per million of gluten. The ruling applies to packaged foods only. FDA suggests that consumers remain inquisitive and ask questions about their food in restaurants and other establishments. "FDA will work with partners in state and local governments with respect to gluten-free labeling in restaurants," the government agency said. Gluten: 5 things you need to know .

A make-up artist fears a mystery illness which has caused her to double in size in just six months will soon leave her unable to move. Laura Pell, 34, weighed 9st (126lb/57kg) last summer and kept herself in shape by going to gym three times a week and eating a sensible diet. But after being struck down with a mystery illness which has baffled doctors, she began to retain fluid which has caused her body to swell in size. She now weighs 17 stone (238lb/108kg) and describes her life as 'hell'. On average, she is gaining an average of one-a-half-stone every month and has gone from a slender size 10 to size 22.

The mysterious health problem has led to  rapid fluid retention, high blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat. Despite several weeks of hospital treatment and taking medication to ease the fluid retention, Miss Pell’s condition has not improved, the Northampton Chronicle reports. After exhausting all treatment routes available on the NHS, she is now raising money for a private medical appointment to see a specialist who may be able to diagnose the cause of the problem. Miss Pell's new appearance has also severely damaged her confidence. As a result, she barely leaves the house and also finds travelling painful. 'My heart rate goes up to about 180 beats per minute whenever I try to do any form of exercise,' she said. Miss Pell, who does not have any children, has suffered from Primary Immune Deficiency for years and needs regular injections to replenish plasma levels in her blood. The condition has caused her to suffered from a number of health problems, including meningitis, tuberculosis, pneumonia and Clostridium Difficile. Last August, doctors discovered a benign tumour on her pituitary gland but this was dismissed as a cause to her rapid fluid retention. She was prescribed powerful diuretics and steroids in an attempt to drain the excess fluid from her body but all treatments have so far failed. She is now planning to see an neurologist and an endocrinologist at a private clinic in Manchester in a desperate bid to find a cure. 'I have had so many doctors tell me I am a "complicated case", but I know that already. 'I want someone who knows how to sort this out. 'My boyfriend and my mum are basically my carers now.

She said: 'I'm a bit like a human waterbed, I'm just so full of liquid, you can see it in my skin' Doctors are baffled as to why she is retaining so much fluid, describing her as a 'complicated case' 'I have two Jack Russell dogs called Sam and Millie and they are often the only thing that gets me out of bed in the morning, but I can't even walk them so Mark has to do that. 'I have been with Mark about 18 months but he has stuck by me through all this. I am very lucky he is with me because he loves me, not for how I look. 'When I catch a glimpse of myself in the reflection of a window or mirror I don't recognise myself.' Her friends have also rallied round and set up a Facebook group called 'Laura Needs Our Help' which already has hundreds of supporters from around the world. Miss Pell said: 'I'm used to being ill because of my immune problems, but this has been so tough.' 'It was really embarrassing the last time I went for an MRI scan because the machine is quite small and they were afraid that if I went in I would get stuck. 'I had to have an alternative CT scan instead. 'No one seems to have any idea what is causing this and I'm genuinely scared I'll soon end up too large to walk.'

Caroline Cici Bellis may not be a household name yet, but the 15-year-old Justin Bieber-loving tennis junior from California is about to be. Just three years after a tiny Cici posed with her idol Maria Sharapova, the wild card stunned Australian Open finalist Dominika Cibulkova in the biggest upset of the U.S. Open so far, winning 6-1 4-6 6-4 against the 12th seed in her grand slam debut. But who is Cici - the number two junior in the world who became the youngest woman to win a match at the U.S. Open since Anna Kournikova in 1996 and the youngest American to win a match at the U.S. Open since Mary Joe Fernandez in 1986? Delight: The young star celebrates her win against the 12th seed in the US Open first round . The bubbly teenager was born in April 1999 in San Francisco and lives in Atherton, California. She first picked up a racket when she was just three, and was naturally gifted thanks to her lineage - her mother played junior tournaments when she was younger. But it was just four years ago - when she was 11 - that she properly turned her focus to the game. 'I went into the match thinking it was going to be such a great experience, but I never thought I would come out on top,' said the teenager, who next plays Kazakh Zarina Diyas. Cici, ranked 1,208, is currently the No. 2 junior behind Ivana Jorovic of Serbia. Cute: An adorable 12-year-old Cici poses with Maria Sharapova on court just three years ago . She has won a series of prestigious junior titles including the Easter Bowl Championships, USTA International Spring Championships, and the Coffee Bowl.​ She's also playing the U.S. Open junior tournament. Cici's amateur status means she is unable to claim the more than 60,000 US dollars in prize money for a first-round victory, but she is in no rush to turn professional. She said: 'I think I'm definitely going to stay an amateur right now to keep my options open for college, in case an injury or something happens. But I'd love to be a pro one day.' Cici's wild card wasn't charity, she earned it when she won the USTA Girls' 18s National Championship, becoming the youngest to win the title since Lindsay Davenport, according to Sports Illustrated. Serving up a shock: Although she is junior world no 2, little was expected of the 15-year-old wildcard . Strain: Cibulkova looked to have sorted out her problems in the second set but Bellis came back to win . Disbelief: Bellis sinks to her knees after winning the final point of a pulsating match . Her idol is Kim Clijsters and the youngster says she models her game style and energy after the four-time major champion, though an adorable picture shows a tiny Cici posing with Maria Sharpova just three years ago. 'It's crazy to think that I'm actually here right now with all these other people,' she said of Tuesday's match. 'I never thought I would be practicing or sharing a court with a player that I watch on TV frequently. It's crazy. But I love it.'	Wildcard Cici Bellis beats 12th seed 6-1 4-6 6-4 .

'Like other high demand events including pop concerts, we expect the website to be very busy and customers may well be held in queues for over 30 minutes at peak times.' But LOCOG were today attacked by StubHub, the UK’s newest secondary ticketing website. StubHub, which launched on 15 March in the UK, claim their research shows that more than three-quarters of Brits feel that the Olympic ticketing process has been mismanaged ‘from start to finish’ and almost 80 per cent believe that tickets should be transferable to family or friends. Countdown: The Olympic flame - seen here in the hands of Amy Clutterbuck in Ilminster today - is gradually making its way around Britain to the capital .

(CNN) -- One of three female undocumented immigrants who were allegedly kidnapped and assaulted was rescued at the south Texas residence of a U.S. Border Patrol agent who was found dead inside, authorities said Thursday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it and other federal and local agencies began a search Wednesday after finding an injured woman who told agents that she and two other women had been assaulted by a man. Investigators found the second woman and continued searching for the third alleged victim. Early Thursday, Mission, Texas, police and members of the Hidalgo County Sheriff's Office, along with federal agents, went to the home of the agent and found him dead, the CBP and FBI said in statements. They entered the home after receiving "further information." Officers freed the third woman believed to have been kidnapped. Mission is in extreme southern Texas, near the Mexican border. The agencies didn't identify the agent or cite a possible manner of death. It was not clear where the alleged abductions took place. The FBI said it is investigating the incident as a kidnapping and assault. The three women were being provided medical care, the CBP said. "CBP takes this incident extremely seriously and we are fully cooperating with the investigation," the agency said. "CBP holds its employees to the highest ethical standards. We stand ready to take any additional action necessary, pending the investigation." The FBI's office in McAllen, Texas, said of the border agent, "the circumstances of his alleged involvement and subsequent death are under investigation."

By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Mercedes stand on the brink of making Formula One history on Sunday after again leaving their rivals in the shade in practice for the Canadian Grand Prix. For the 11th time in 20 practice sessions this season, Lewis Hamilton finished top of the timesheet, spearheading a one-two with team-mate Nico Rosberg who had to settle for second best at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. If there is a repeat of that order in the race, or even a reversal should Rosberg get the better of Hamilton for the second successive event, Mercedes will earn a place in the sport's history books. On track: Lewis Hamilton was fastest in Montreal on Friday ahead of this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix . Magic in Montreal: The 29-year-old Briton has triumphed on three previous occasions in Canada . No team in F1's 64-year existence has scored six successive one-twos, with Mercedes currently equal with Ferrari on five who have twice managed the feat, in 1952 and again in 2002. Despite Rosberg's contentious win in Monaco a fortnight ago which led to a fall-out between the German and Hamilton, the latter is red-hot favourite to strike back quickly. Hamilton has triumphed on three previous occasions in Montreal, and has also scored a trio of poles in his seven events at the circuit. For once, come the conclusion to the two 90-minute practice outings, there was a reasonable gap between the duo. Title battle: Rosberg leads Hamilton in the championship by four points ahead of this weekend's grand prix . Picture perfect: Kevin Magnussen takes on the hairpin during practice for round seven of the championship . Hamilton clocked a time on the fastest of Pirelli's tyre rubber, the supersoft compound, of one minute 16.118secs, with Rosberg 0.175secs adrift. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, who was quickest in FP1, had to settle for fifth overall at the end of the day, with the Spaniard 0.583secs off the pace. Reigning four-times champion Sebastian Vettel in his Red Bull and Kimi Raikkonen for Ferrari were ahead of the Spaniard, both around half-a-second behind. Life in the fast lane: Reigning champion Sebastian Vettel was third fastest on Friday . The Williams' pairing of Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas thrust themselves into top-10 contention, similarly the McLarens of Kevin Magnussen and Jenson Button. Just seven thousandths of a second separated the latter duo, who were the last of the drivers to come within a second of Hamilton's pace. Toro Rosso's Jean-Eric Vergne repeated his feat in FP1 of finishing 10th in the second session, but a full second adrift. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, third in the last two races, was down in a surprising 12th, not just 1.5secs behind Hamilton, but a second off of team-mate Vettel. Max Chilton performed strongly to claim 18th in his Marussia, with the Briton 2.5secs adrift. However, two of the drivers behind him in Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat and Jules Bianchi in his Marussia encountered issues that curtailed their running ends .	No team in Formula One history has recorded six straight 1-2 finishes . Hamilton is the red-hot favourite to win in Canada this weekend . Alonso fastest in the morning session, but was only 5th later in the day . Sebastian Vettel was the best of the rest behind the Mercedes pair .
Conjoined twins Knatalye and Adeline Mata, who were born in Texas back in April sharing a number of vital organs, are now one step closer towards a normal childhood. Earlier this week, the 8-month-old siblings who share a liver, intestines, chest wall, diaphragm, lungs, pelvis and heart lining, underwent a complicated five-hour surgery to stretch their skin in preparation for their separation. During the procedure, a team of specialists embedded custom-made tissue expanders into the girls' chest and abdomen. Anxious and excited: The Mata Family prepare for their conjoined twins to depart for surgery to implant skin expanders . Rough start: Knatalye and Adeline Mata were born in Texas back in April sharing a number of vital organs . State of the art: A team of specialists at Texas Children's Hospital embedded custom-made tissue expanders into the girls' chest and abdomen . Over the course of the next few weeks, fluid will be added to the balloon-like expanders to allow for the gradual stretching of the patients' skin. Pictured on the right are the twins after the five-hour surgery . Breathing a sigh of relief: The operation performed by surgeons at Texas Children’s Hospital Tuesday was declared a success, setting the stage for the next step in the process . Over the course of the next few weeks, fluid will be added to the balloon-like expanders to allow for the gradual stretching of the patients' skin, reported Houston Chronicle. The operation performed by surgeons at Texas Children’s Hospital Tuesday was declared a success, setting the stage for the next step in the process of pulling the children apart. ‘We are so thankful for the support and thoughts and prayers for our girls as they continue to grow, recover and prepare for the next step in their journey,’ Elyssa Mata, the girls’ mother, said in a statement. The Mata twins will spend the next six-eight weeks recovering from the surgery. Their ultimate separation has been scheduled for early next year. Knatalye Hope and Adeline Faith Mata weighed just 3lbs 7oz each when they were delivered by Cesarean section at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston at 31 weeks on April 11. Adorable: Knatalye Hope and Adeline Faith Mata, pictured with their mother Elysse, weighed just 3lbs 7oz each when they were delivered by Cesarean section at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston on April 11 . Conjoined twins: The adorable sisters, who remain in the hospital's Level IV Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, are joined at the abdomen. They share a liver, diaphragm, pelvis, intestines and the lining of the heart . In October, Knatalye and Adeline's mother, who spends at least seven hours at the hospital every day, said she felt 'sick' with worry about the long and arduous procedure. 'When I think about December I get that sick feeling in my stomach. I want to know how much pain they are going to feel after. What is it going to be like for them?' she told Reuters at the time. 'They are where they should be developmentally. They reach up for toys, they reach out for us when we get close and talk to them.' After the separation, the girls will undergo rehabilitation to learn how to balance, crawl and walk. In 1992, surgeons at Texas Children's Hospital successfully separated one-year-old twins Tiesha and Iesha Turner, who  shared a sternum, liver, entwined intestines and fused organs. Cared for: The girls (pictured in hospital with their mother) will undergo six-to-eight weeks of tissue expansion to stretch skin that will be used to cover patches of their bodies when they are separated . Twins: Knatalye and Adeline's mother, Elysse, who spends at least seven hours at the hospital every day, said in October she felt 'sick' with worry about the long and arduous separation procedure . Together: After the procedure, the girls will undergo rehabilitation to learn how to balance, crawl and walk . Conjoined twins occur once every 200,000 births. Around 40 to 60 per cent  arrive stillborn, while 35 per cent live only one day, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. Mortality rates for twins who do live and then undergo separation vary, depending on their type of connection and the organs they share, it said. The Mata family's life was turned upside down in January when a routine ultrasound revealed that Mrs Mata was carrying conjoined twins. The family was referred to the hospital's Fetal Center. The expectant mother, her husband John and their five-year-old son Azariah relocated from Lubbock to Houston, where the girls were born. Loving family: Mrs Mata, pictured with her husband John and their five-year-old son Azariah, spends at least seven hours at the hospital every day leaving only when it is time to pick up her son from school . On a YouCaring page, Mrs Mata said the twin's 20 per cent chance of survival at birth inspired their middle names, Faith and Hope. While the mother spends most of her daily life at the hospital, leaving only when it is time to pick up her son from school, full-time worker Mr Mata spends every weekend with his daughters. Mr Cass said he expects both Knatalye and Adelie to be able to experience independent, happy lives following the surgery. But he added: 'It is likely further reconstructive surgeries may be needed in the future. Perhaps the biggest challenges may be orthopedic and in helping them walk and have normal gait.'

By . Peter Rugg . An Ohio woman's run in with the law likely would've stayed in Ohio if only she'd resisted the urge to make the ridiculous face displayed in her mug shot which is now going viral. According to a post on the Wickliffe Police Department Facebook page, Angela Green, 34, was arrested after refusing to leave her hotel room at the Quality Inn Saturday. Shortly after noon, the hotel's management called police requesting help in getting Green and male companion Brian Baker, of Cleveland to leave room 253. Cleveland woman Angela Green took an outrageous mugshot Saturday when she was arrested after refusing to leave her hotel room room . 'The officer explained that they needed to leave or . rent the room for another day and the female became loud and . uncooperative.' the post noted. 'As the . couple was being escorted from the building it was discovered that she . had provided fictitious information,' the post continued. 'Once outside, the female continued . to become loud and uncooperative and refused to identify herself. After a brief struggle the female was arrested and transported to the . WPD.' Green, of Cleveland, was then charged with obstructing official business. For reasons known only to her, Green decided to puff up her lips and present a mugshot it appears she was arrested for imitating a blowfish. The post has since received 199 likes and 150 comments as of the time of this writing, as well as appearing on several blogs and news sites. 'Is that what they used to call a come-hither look?' joked Facebook user Tom Klaber. 'Duck Face x10,' joked poster Amanda Sojka. She was finally released on $354 cash bond and her new online celebrity.	Angela Green, 34, of Cleveland, was arrested after refusing to leave her Quality Inn hotel room .
