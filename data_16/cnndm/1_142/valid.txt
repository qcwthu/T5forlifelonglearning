The League Two clash between play-off rivals Bury and Southend at the JD Stadium had to be abandoned after just seven minutes as torrential rain rendered the pitch unplayable. The game went ahead despite a heavy downpour prior to the 3pm kick-off but after a short discussion with the managers the referee decided to postpone the match. The officials planned to bring the players back out after 20 minutes to re-assess the state of the pitch and the weather but, despite the use of rollers during the break, the match was abandoned. Players were taken off the pitch just seven minutes into the League Two clash between Bury and Southend . Torrential rain before and during the game cause the pitch to become waterlogged . Bury groundsman tries in vain to rid the pitch of some of the surface water before the game was abandoned . Players battle for the ball in the very wet conditions before the game was postponed . The visiting Southend fans had to make the 500-mile, eight hour round trip from Essex to Lancashire to witness just a few minutes of football and the fixture is now likely to be replayed on a midweek evening. Bury manager David Flicroft said: 'Absolutely right decision by the ref, he had every right to start the game. Well done to the ref for making the right decision. 'I am gutted for the fans, as it looked like a great turn out by them today. It's tough for the Southend fans now who'll have to make the long trip up on a Tuesday night now.' Southend fans had to make the 500-mile round trip that would have taken longer than eight hours . Southend manager Phil Brown leaves the pitch in the heavy rain . Both manager agreed that it was the right decision to call the game off . Southend manager Phil Brown shared Flicroft's sentiments regarding the supporters but was able to take comfort in the fact he didn't have a full-strength side for the crucial fixture. 'I’m disappointed for the fans but it’s a good call for us because we had four players out today,' Brown said. 'Twenty minutes before the game the pitch was playable and both managers agreed with that. But it was monsoon-like and the rain is still coming down so it was the right decision (to abandon the game).' Supporters have been offered a half price ticket for the re-arranged fixture.

The match was later abandoned as the rain continued to fall .
Professor David Nutt was sacked from his job as the UK Government's chief adviser on drugs after saying saying ecstasy and LSD were less harmful than alcohol . A British scientist trying to reveal what the human brain looks like on LSD is asking the public to fund his research after official channels refused. In the controversial study, 20 British volunteers will be the first in the world to have their brains scanned while high on LSD. Early results are said to be 'exciting' but the full findings must wait until funding can be found to complete the research. The research, being conducted at Cardiff University, is being led by the former drugs tsar David Nutt. Professor Nutt was sacked from his job as the Government's chief adviser on drugs in 2009 after saying saying ecstasy and LSD were less harmful than alcohol. At a briefing in London this week, he spoke out against restrictions on research on recreational drugs which he called 'the worst censorship in the history of science'. Having been turned down by 'classic funders', he is now campaigning to raise the £25,000 needed to carry out analysis of the brain scanning data from the science crowdfunding site Walacea.com. He compared current attitudes to studying recreational drugs with the Catholic church's clampdown on pioneering Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei in the 17th century. 'The only comparable example is when the Catholic church banned the telescope in 1616,' said Professor Nutt, who is based at Imperial College London. 'We've banned research on psychedelic drugs and other drugs like cannabis for 50 years. 'Truly in terms of the amount of wasted opportunity, it's way greater than the banning of the telescope. This is a truly appalling level of censorship.' The LSD study involved giving the volunteers injections of a 75 microgram dose of LSD before probing the activity of their brains. Two kinds of scans were used, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (Meg), which measures small magnetic fields generated in the brain. None of the participants reported having a bad experience, but three described some anxiety and temporary paranoia. Dr Robin Carhart-Harris, also from the Imperial College team, said the dose of LSD given to the volunteers was a 'tiny speck'. But he added: 'The effects are quite profound. It would be described as a moderate dose, but a moderate dose of LSD can still produce a profound state of consciousness. In the controversial study, 20 British volunteers will be the first in the world to have their brains scanned while high on LSD . 'I wouldn't say that it's a dangerous experiment, but I would say that LSD has potential negative effects. 'Probably the crucial one is a bad trip. It's not uncommon for people to have anxiety during a psychedelic drug experience .. the experience can be nightmarish at times. 'What's especially intriguing.. is that people can have a very challenging experience yet afterwards they seem to be somehow psychologically refreshed by the experience. That's how they describe it.' He said there had been no evidence of psychedelic drugs such as LSD triggering psychosis in research studies, although there were anecdotal reports of this occurring through recreational use. Professor Nutt said LSD was widely studied in the 1950s and 1960s and shown to be therapeutically useful in treating 'many conditions', in particular alcoholism. Since it was made illegal in 1967 it had only been the subject of one clinical study in Switzerland and two neuroscience studies. 'That is an absurd amount of censorship,' Professor Nutt added. He stood by the claim that got him into trouble with the Government - that psychoactive drugs such as ecstasy and LSD were considerably less harmful than alcohol. 'Interesting drugs that we've been researching like MDNA (ecstasy) and LSD, are relatively low in terms of harms, considerably less even than cannabis and very much less than alcohol,' he said. 'But no research is done on them. 'The law is actually wrong. The law is supposed to be based on evidence of harm but isn't.' He maintained that the risks of taking LSD had been 'massively exaggerated' by the CIA and US Drug Enforcement Administration. Initial funding for the LSD study came from Imperial College and the Beckley Foundation, which promotes drug policy reform and research into the medical benefits of psychoactive substances. Professor Nutt said LSD (a molecule of the drug is pictured) was widely studied in the 1950s and 1960s and shown to be therapeutically useful in treating 'many conditions', in particular alcoholism . Professor Nutt said he approached the Medical Research Council and Wellcome Trust for the outstanding funding to no avail. 'The issue always comes 'well look, these are recreational drugs', and the recreational label is so powerful I think it scares people off,' he said. 'I personally think the neuroscience that's been uncovered by these drugs is revolutionary. 'This research is so important it should be funded to the tune of millions.' Dr Carhart-Harris said: 'This is the first LSD brain imaging study that's ever been conducted. 'We think it's essentially important to understand how these drugs that are widely used and seem to have this therapeutic potential work in the brain. Once we've done that, we want to look at how these drugs can be put to good use.' A previous brain scanning study was carried out by the same team on volunteers under the influence of the magic mushroom active ingredient psilocybin. It showed that the drug affected the brain's 'hub structure' and led to more connections between regions that are not normally linked. This, it is thought, may have a bearing on creative thinking. In May, the team is planning a study, funded by the Medical Research Council, looking at how psilocybin might be helpful in treating depression.

Ann Summers has been forced to remove raunchy Fifty Shades of Grey-style posters from its windows following a backlash from mothers and campaigners. The high street lingerie chain confirmed several branches, located near stores targeted at children such as Mothercare and Build-A-Bear, have removed the provocative images. The posters, which were rolled out in all 142 Ann Summers stores several weeks ago, show a woman kneeling on a red sofa, dressed in a cut-away leotard that reveals her breasts and nipple tassels. She is holding a large leather whip and striking a provocative pose next to a handcuffed man in his underpants. Ann Summers has been forced to remove raunchy Fifty Shades of Grey-style posters showing a woman wearing nipple tassels and holding a whip . Mothers and campaigners have complained saying the the 'pornographic' images could be easily seen by children . In what appears to be a reference to the bondage film Fifty Shades of Grey, which was released nationwide during Valentine's weekend, the text on the poster reads: Fact not fiction. Bring the film to life. Last night Vivienne Pattison of campaign group Mediawatch-UK said her group had made complaints about nine branches of Ann Summers. As a result the posters, which have been described as pornographic, have been removed from stores in Milton Keynes, Wimbledon, Sutton, Norwich, Eastbourne, Taunton, and the Ann Summers stores in all 18 Intu Chapelfield shopping centres. A spokesman for Ann Summers confirmed the company has had six complaints from its retail stores and fewer than 20 complaints via email or letters. Miss Pattison said the campaign potentially breached the recommendations made by the 2011 Bailey Review into the sexualisation of children, which was backed by Prime Minister David Cameron. The high street lingerie chain confirmed several branches, located near stores targeted at children such as Mothercare and Build-A-Bear, have removed the provocative images . The posters show a woman kneeling on a red sofa, dressed in a cut-away leotard, with a man in handcuffs . She said: 'We are used to seeing the windows of Ann Summers featuring lingerie but this image, featuring a bare breasted (except for nipple tassels) model goes too far and is inappropriate for display in places which are likely to have numbers of children present. 'Any child passing this image will be subject to its overt sexual messaging and imagery. Government guidelines for retailers in the Bailey Review state that sexualised images should not be displayed in children's eye line. 'This government has done much to address the early sexualisation of children in our society and Ann Summers needs to be made aware that it too has a responsibility in this regard.' Miss Pattison's concerns were echoed by members of the public, including Christian pastor Paul Burns, who said he was shocked to see the display on his way to church. He said: 'I watched four separate families pull their children away from this window display. It has whips, it has a woman basically degraded with what you would expect to see in a porn film that people buy to watch. It is not what you expect to see in a family shopping centre.' Taking to Twitter, others expressed similar views, with one writing: 'Please remove your offensive window displays based on 50Shades of Grey, sexualising children, inciting abuse of women.' Another tweeted: 'Awful display in @Ann_Summers exposing children to sexualised imagery opposite @mothercareuk.' A spokesman for Ann Summers said: 'Our Dark Desires campaign launched on 26th January 2015. Therefore, our campaign imagery has been visible in both our stores and online for a number of weeks now but it's only this week that we have received a handful of complaints. 'In regards to the 50SOG references, the 'Bring the film to life', we have taken inspiration from the themes and trends surrounding the film and the wording is a tongue-in-cheek 'nod to'.'

Thierry Henry has claimed he was unfairly hounded for the infamous handball that cost the Republic of Ireland a place at the 2010 World Cup while Lionel Messi was labelled a 'genius' after a similar incident. The France striker used his hand to control a cross before setting up William Gallas to score the 103rd-minute goal that took France to the finals in South Africa at Ireland's expense. Henry, then a Barcelona player, was heavily criticised for his actions at the time but has pointed out the contrasting reaction when his former Nou Camp team-mate Messi scored with his hand against Espanyol in 2007. Thierry Henry controls the ball with his hand to set up a goal for William Gallas in France's World Cup 2010 play-off with the Republic of Ireland in November 2009 . Henry claims he was vilified after the incident, claiming the reaction was as if he'd 'killed someone' Henry, who now works as a pundit for Sky Sports, claims he was unfairly criticised over his handball . The Arsenal legend told Canal Plus: 'You are talking about people I spent so many times on the pitch with. 'I just said to them, 'Yes, it was hand, I'm sorry.' And you know what? They told me: 'We don't blame you.' 'I saw Liam Brady, the Arsenal legend, and he asked me: 'Did you touch it with your hand?' And I answered, 'Yes, it was my hand.' I spoke to the press that night. I could have ignored them but I didn't. 'I spoke honestly - it was a reflex. A reflex by a competitor, just like when you reach out for the ball on the line when your goalkeeper is beaten. 'When I see Messi scoring against Espanyol, diving to touch the ball with his hand, people say, 'What a genius, now he is closer than ever to Maradona.' But when it was me, it was like I had killed someone.' Lionel Messi scored a goal with his hand in Barcelona's league match with Espanyol back in June 2007 . Diego Maradona's infamous 'Hand of God' moment against England at the 1986 World Cup . The 37-year-old, who is now a pundit on Sky Sports, left Barcelona for New York Red Bulls shortly after the handball controversy, which occurred in a qualification play-off, second leg at the Stade de France in Paris. But Henry denies that the storm of criticism following the handball was behind his move. 'I have always wanted to go there,' he said. 'Anyone who knows me would tell you that. Also, to escape what? To escape who? I wanted to go as soon as 2009, but I didn't because I kept playing with the national team. That is total rubblish.'	Arsenal legend believes he was unfairly criticised over handball .

Twelve years ago 24 photographers decided to carry out an ambitious project - to document a full New Year's Day every year for 24 years. To begin with each was allocated one hour of the day to record what was going on around them. But the project did not stop there. This was a project that was to last 24 years, with each photographer progressing one hour every year, so that at the end of 24 years, there will be 24 sets of images from New Year's Day - or 576 images. 00.00 by Yvonne De Rosa – Untitled: 'I was in Reykjavik and I was with friends in the square close to the main church.' To contrast with the chaos she took this picture of a couple in 'a calm embrace and in their own magic space' The original 24 photographers met while studying on a postgraduate photography course at Central St Martin's in London. Six prints from this year's project will be auctioned off in aid of Hope and Homes for Children, an international charity working to ensure that all children have the chance to grow up in the love of a family. Curator Bridget Coaker said: 'When I first heard about 24photography I thought what a great idea, I do hope they manage to keep the momentum going. Now in its 12th year this group of dedicated photographers are still going out in all weathers and all hours to capture something that shows something of the first day of each New Year. Their commitment to the project is inspiring.' Claire Spreadbury, founder of 24photography, said: 'The exhibition is going from strength to strength and now in our twelfth year we've really developed an identity and feel that we're an established part of London's art calendar. New Year's Day is an exciting time of the year, and we hope that 24 captures some of that excitement, but also gives a little glimpse into the rest of the day after the celebrations and parties.' 01:00 by Algy Sharman – Superhero: 'This shot was taken in a cafe near a spooky industrial estate outside Stockholm.This guy and his buddy were out skateboarding.

(CNN)UPDATE: Jonathan Hyla said in an phone interview Monday that his interview with Cate Blanchett was mischaracterized when an edited version went viral around the Web last week. "She wasn't upset," he told CNN. "When you watch the entire interview in the full context, you can see she instigates a lot of the ridiculousness that ensues in the interview." Blanchett ended the interview laughing, Hyla said, and "she was in on the joke." This article has been updated and includes the unedited interview. If you're going to interview Cate Blanchett, please have some good questions prepared. Blanchett was talking to Jonathan Hyla of the Australian TV show "The Project" in conjunction with "Cinderella," but Hyla's offbeat questions led to an awkward few minutes. Hyla thought he'd begin the interview on a casual note, saying Blanchett would be a good person to have a beer with. Blanchett was having none of it. "This date is not going well; I do not drink beer," she responded. After some more back-and-forth, with an apparently sometimes testy, sometimes punchy Blanchett trying to steer the topic of conversation back to the film, Hyla finally tried another angle. "How were you able to get that cat to do what you wanted (it) to do on a leash?" he asked about a cat Blanchett's nasty stepmother has in the film. "I tried to put my girlfriend's cat on a leash, and it just never works for me." That was enough for Blanchett. "That's your question? That's your f***ing question?" she asked. She stood up and awkwardly presented her hand. The interview was over. Hyla took it well. He later posted that it was "the best worst interview I've ever done." Hyla later tweeted the unedited interview after an edited version went viral.	A Cate Blanchett interview goes awry . The interviewer tries to ask Blanchett casual questions .

A post-mortem examination found shop worker Miss Pollock, 41, died as a result of strangulation and severe stab wounds to the neck . A 52-year-old builder has been charged with murder following the discovery of a woman's body at a flat. Officers found the body of Sarah Pollock, 41, in her flat in the Springbourne area of Bournemouth, Dorset, at 3.26pm on March 25. Her colleagues raised the alarm when she failed to open the shop she was working for at the Dolphin Centre in Poole. A post-mortem examination found Miss Pollock died as a result of strangulation and severe stab wounds to the neck. Builder Colin Dymond, 52, from Bournemouth, who was known to Miss Pollock, was today charged with her murder. He will appear before Bournemouth Magistrates' Court tomorrow. Detective Inspector Mark Samuel, of Dorset Police, said: 'Family liaison officers have updated Sarah's family with this development and the thoughts of the investigation team are with her loved ones. 'Clearly this is a very difficult time for the whole family and they have requested privacy. 'I would also like to thank local people who have been patient and assisted police, particularly some of the residents of Avon Close who have been temporarily relocated. 'Their understanding and co-operation has helped us conduct a thorough investigation into this tragic matter as swiftly as possible.' At 3.26pm on Wednesday, March 25, Dorset police found the body of the 41-year-old in her flat in Avon Close in the Springbourne area after concerns were raised that she had not arrived at work as expected . Miss Pollock's body was formally identified by family members, who are being supported by police family liaison officers. Mr Samuel appealed for the public's help to trace the movements of a Peugeot 308 estate hire care with the registration HN14 HWC. 'Although we have charged a man with murder we still want to hear from members of the public if they have any information that could help with the investigation into Sarah's death,' he said. 'We have now recovered the Peugeot hire car from the London area and I am interested if anyone saw it being driven or parked in Dorset or Hampshire between 4pm on Tuesday 24 March and 10pm on Wednesday 25 March 2015. If so, please call Dorset Police urgently. 'We are still building a picture of exactly what happened to Sarah. If anyone saw or heard anything suspicious in the Avon Close area of Bournemouth or has any other information that could be useful, I would urge them to please get in touch.' In a statement, Miss Pollock's family said: 'We have lost an important part of our lives; a kind, caring, honest, outgoing and ultimately indescribable daughter, sister and auntie from our close-knit family. 'She was unforgettable and she will always remain in our hearts and minds, although she should not be gone. 'We respectfully ask that we are left to grieve without intrusion and want to thank Dorset Police for their hard work so far in helping our distraught family.' Anyone with information should contact Dorset Police on 101 quoting Operation Inlet. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

A further four girls who attend the same east London school as three teenagers who travelled to Syria to join ISIS are being monitored by detectives over fears they may seek to do the same. Including the trio who succeeded in leaving Britain last month, it is thought a total of seven girls at Bethnal Green Academy were considered vulnerable to being radicalised as early as December when a fellow female pupil went to join the jihadis. After the 15-year-old managed to board a flight to Turkey the other girls were placed on a government warning list with the aim of preventing them from taking the same path. Left to right: Kadiza Sultana, 16, and 15-year-olds Shamima Begum and Amira Abase. Their families fear police action may have pushed them towards leaving for Syria . Bethnal Green Academy, where four girls thought vulnerable to radicalisation are still being monitored . Shamima Begum and Amira Abase, both 15, and 16-year-old Kadiza Sultana are all thought to now be Syria after last month flying to Turkey and travelling on by bus. The family of Ms Sultana has voiced concerns that letters from counter-terrorism detectives given to the girls but meant for their parents may have prompted them to leave. The letters, in which detectives sought permission to take statements from the trio in relation to the disappearance of their classmate in December, never reached the girls' parents as they were not passed on. The letters are thought to have been sent shortly before the teenagers themselves left for Syria on February 17. Fahmida Aziz, a cousin of Ms Sultana, told Vice News: 'Were they feeling victimised by police? Were they feeling criminalised? 'Did they feel they had done something wrong? My query would be, by giving this letter, how did that make the girls feel?' Dated February 2, the letters made clear the teenagers were 'not under any suspicion of doing something wrong'. Left to right: Ms Sultana, Ms Begum and Ms Abase at Gatwick Airport before boarding a flight for Turkey . CCTV shows the three schoolgirls (circled) at a bus station in Turkey during their journey to join ISIS . The three teenagers are believed to have travelled over ground from Istanbul to Gaizantep, before crossing the border into Syria near the Kilis crossing . Family members claim that as well as not receiving the letters, the girls' parents were not informed they had been spoken to twice in school by officers. Jubeyda Rauf, the 16-year-old sister of Ms Sultana, said she felt like police 'just let them walk out'. There was no evidence the girls were thinking of fleeing to Syria prior to their departure, Scotland Yard said in a statement, adding that their disappearance had 'come as a great surprise, not least to their own families'. The remaining four girls who are under scrutiny also received the letters and are continuing to attend Bethnal Green Academy, which has been told by police there is no evidence radicalisation took place within its walls. It is understood that detectives have examined mobile phones belonging to the quartet to look at their contacts with the three other teenagers prior to February 17. One line of inquiry is believed to be the theory that the girls who travelled to Syria were directly assisted by an ISIS facilitator based in Britain.	Seven girls at Bethnal Green Academy considered open to radicalisation . This included trio who fled to Syria last month after flying to Turkey . Whole group sent letters asking parents if police could take statements . These never reached those of the three teenagers now with ISIS .

Fresh security fears have been raised in Paris after a drone was seen hovering over the current offices of the Charlie Hebdo magazine. The sighting was one of around a dozen reported over sensitive sites in the French capital in just one day earlier this week. One of those came from a police officer who claimed he saw an unnamed aircraft flying over the offices of Liberation newspaper where staff from Charlie Hebdo are now based after their building was targeted by Islamic militants in an attack that killed 12 people. New alert: A drone was seen hovering over the current offices being used by staff at the Charlie Hebdo satirical newspaper (above) following the terror attack on their building that killed 12 people in January . New threat: French law bans small, civilian drones from areas such as nuclear facilities, which are protected by a no-fly zone that spans a 1.6-mile radius and a height of 1,000 metres. The above drone crashed on the grass near the White House in the United States earlier this year . Police pursued the drone, but lost it at the porte de Montreuil, which leads to the ring road southeast of the capital. However, it was later spotted at  Porte de Vincennes, where a fanatical accomplice of the Charlie Hebdo killers shot dead four people at a Jewish supermarket, the Daily Telegraph reported. Another drone sighting was reported over eastern Paris where witnesses saw three men retrieve the aircraft and drive off in a black car before police could arrest them, a police source said. No arrests were made over the flights, which also reportedly took place near the River Seine, the Place de la Concorde and the Invalides military museum. French police have vowed to track down and . arrest the operators of the drones amid fears from the public they could be used to attach explosives or toxic chemicals. Earlier this week, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told . parliament that some 60 drone flights over Paris and over . nuclear power plants had been reported since October 5. Tension: In other sightings, drones were also seen flying around the  Eiffel Tower earlier this year . Drones were also spotted flying near the Invalides military museum, where Napoleon Bonaparte is buried . Flights over Paris without authorisation from aviation . authorities are illegal, as is the use of airspace up to 1,000 . metres above a nuclear site. 'We need to be very vigilant on this, we're going to have to . be extremely careful,' government spokesman Stephane Le Foll . told France Info radio, referring to the drones. 'The day that . we find the people who are doing this, there will be penalties... we will find them, sooner or later.' France is still on high alert following a series of attacks . in January that killed 20 people, including three attackers. Interior Minister Cazeneuve also told parliament he wanted . to equip police with 'new legal tools' to crack down on the . illegal use of drones in sensitive areas. On Tuesday, a court fined a British journalist 1,000 euros ($1,100) for flying a drone over central Paris and confiscated his machine. Tristan Redman, 34, from the Qatar-based network Al-Jazeera, was arrested last month in the Bois de Boulogne park on the western edge of the French capital along with two other journalists. The two others were released and Redman pleaded guilty to flying a drone over the capital, which is illegal under French law. France remains on high alert after jihadist attacks in and around the French capital in January left 17 people dead.	Police officer saw aircraft flying over current office of satirical newspaper .

Chelsea Clinton went by the pseudonym Diane Reynolds, and Hillary used the same email account that was dedicated to her work at the State Department to plan her daughter's wedding, a new report has revealed. At the center of the controversy is Hillary Clinton's email account - hrd22@clintonemail.com, which was set up a day before she was confirmed in 2009 by a Senate committee to join newly elected President Barack Obama's cabinet. The New York Times reports that Clinton used the address for everything from official government business to matters relating to the Clinton Foundation, and the State Department confirmed on Wednesday that was Clinton's only email alias during her tenure in the Obama administration. News articles detailing the former secretary of state's arrangement to have her government correspondence run through a private domain name and self-run server have set off alarms about the possibility of her sensitive communications being hacked or destroyed. Scroll down for video . Marc Mezvinsky, Hillary Clinton, then-Secretary of State, Chelsea Clinton and former President Bill Clinton pose during the wedding of Chelsea  and Marc at the Astor Courts Estate on July 31, 2010 in Rhinebeck, New York. A news report reveled that Chelsea used to go  by the pseudonym of Diane Reynolds, and Hillary used the same email account that was dedicated to her work at the State Department to plan her daughter's wedding . At least one of Hillary Clinton's longtime aides, Huma Abedin, who is still on Clinton's payroll, had one of the coveted Clintonemail.com addresses, as well, the Times reports. In the beginning, Chelsea Clinton used the same domain name for her email address, under the name Diane Reynolds, which the Times says she also gave to hotels when she checked in, but switched over to chelseaoffice.com at the urging of the family's advisers. Concerned that Hillary could appear too closely tied with the Clinton Foundation if she used the same domain name as the rest of her family, Bill Clinton ran his email through presidentclinton.com. The Clintons' server was run out of their Chappaqua, New York, home. According to Bloomberg, they transferred it to a commercial provider, MX Logic, after Hillary departed the State Department. The Clintonemail.com domain name was originally registered to Bill Clinton confidante Eric Hothem, the Times discovered. Hothem is the same aide who was charged with packing up and carting off furniture from the White House at the end of Bill Clinton's presidency that he said was 'Clinton’s personal property.' The furnishings were later determined to be government property, however, and the Clintons were required to pay  $86,000 in restitution for the items they kept. Others, they had to return. Hothem now works in finance in Washington, D.C., and another former Clinton staffer's name is on the server registration - Justin Cooper. It is set to expire in 2017, when Hillary Clinton would theoretically take office if she were to compete for and win the presidency next year. Cooper has also since left the employment of the Clintons for Teneo Holdings, a firm managed by a former Bill Clinton adviser Douglas Band. In a tweet late on Wednesday, the likely Democratic presidential candidate said she asked the State Department to release the 55,000 pages emails she turned over. A State Department official told Reuters on Wednesday, though, that 'the review is likely to take several months given the sheer volume of the document set' The Clintons are pictured here at a conference for their family foundation in September. Hillary Clinton became a name partner in the endeavor after she left the State Department in 2013. Chelsea Clinton at one time used the same domain name for her emails as her mother. Concerned that Hillary could appear too closely tied with the Clinton Foundation while at State if she used the same domain name as the rest of her family, Chelsea migrated to chelseaoffice.com and Bill ran his email through presidentclinton.com . While the email addresses of all secretaries of state before John Kerry doubled as both their personal and professional points of contact, Clinton's deliberate decision to keep her exchanges out of the reach of the federal government has come under intense scrutiny. The White House and the State Department have been careful to state that to their knowledge, all of Clinton's emails have been secured, and additional questions should be directed at Clinton and her team. A spokesman for Clinton has said that the top-ranking diplomat transmitted all of government-related communications to the State Department, but no proof positive of that assertion exists. A security expert who spoke to Bloomberg News warned that in maintaining her own server, Clinton retains the power to wipe all of her data without a trace. 'You erase it and everything’s gone,' Matt Devost, the president & CEO of global cybersecurity firm FusionX, said. Another expert, threat intelligence analyst Alex McGeorge told Bloomberg that Clinton's encryption system was misconfigured and could be hacked. House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz said Wednesday of the debacle that, 'It does beg the question: Were there any sort of classified pieces of information that were flowing through her personal email account?' Comparing the disclosure to that of former CIA chief David Petraeus, who plead guilty this week to mishandling classified information, Chaffetz pointed out that sharing classified information over email ''with somebody who didn't have a classification' is a crime. A State Department spokeswoman said Wednesday there's 'no indication that Secretary Clinton used her personal e-mail account for anything but unclassified purposes,' however. Instead, Clinton had her staff print out classified documents for her or discussed that information over secure phone and video conference calls. At the center of the controversy is Hillary Clinton's email account - hrd22@clintonemail.com, which was set up a day before she was confirmed in 2009 by a Senate committee to join newly elected President Barack Obama's cabinet. The two are seen here at an October 2008 rally . On Wednesday evening Clinton made her first public comments on the fracas. She wrote on Twitter: 'I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible.' Secretary of State John Kerry confirmed on Thursday while in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia  that the department 'will undertake this task as rapidly as possible in order to make sure that we are dealing with the sheer volume in a responsible way.' A State Department official told Reuters on Wednesday, though, that 'the review is likely to take several months given the sheer volume of the document set.' Clinton's team turned over 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department. Republicans aren't convinced that her entire body of work was disclosed, however, and they're calling for investigations into the matter. A special House Committee exclusively focused on auditing the executive branch's response to the 2012 Benghazi terror attack is subpoenaing emails from Clinton's personal account. And the Republican National Committee asked the State Department's inspector general on Thursday insisting it launch an examination of its own to ensure that Clinton followed the law. Cause of Action, a conservative watchdog group, accused Clinton on Thursday of 'selectively' turning over her correspondence to State, which it said is 'disingenuous and entirely inadequate.' Clinton's request that State make public her emails 'does nothing to address the key questions of whether official communications were deleted or whether sensitive classified information was put at risk,' the group's executive director, Dan Epstein, said in a statement. 'Americans deserve a full investigation into whether evidence exists that official communications weren't being reported for public records, but there may be no way to know for sure,' Epstein said. 'This is exactly why this kind of behavior is against the law. It belies the spirit of openness and transparency in government. It keeps the public in the dark, and it raises serious national security concerns.'	At the center of the controversy: Hillary Clinton's personal email account - hrd22@clintonemail.com .

Radamel Falcao started in attack for Manchester United's Under 21 side just 24 hours after being given the cold shoulder by Louis van Gaal. The Colombian striker, who was an unused substitute during United's FA Cup defeat at the hands of Arsenal on Monday night, was named in a strong starting XI which also included fellow first team stars Rafael, James Wilson and Victor Valdes. Falcao, who earns £280,000 a week at the Barclays Premier League outfit, was replaced in the 72nd minute after failing to hit the back of the net in what proved to be yet another lifeless display. Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao started in attack for the Red Devils' Under 21 side . The Colombian was taken off in the 72nd minute after failing to impress at Old Trafford . First team stars Falcao, Victor Valdes, Rafael and James Wilson started against Tottenham .

Falcao now has just 10 first team games to prove his worth to Manchester United manager Van Gaal before the end of his season-long loan deal. Manchester United have an option to sign Falcao on a permanent basis for £43million in the summer with Van Gaal deciding to stall his decision for as long as possible. Falcao has scored just four goals since joining the Red Devils on a temporary deal - with his latest strike coming against Leicester City on January 31. United boss Van Gaal jumped to the defence of Falcao on Monday night by hitting out at the press for criticising the former Atletico Madrid star. Falcao was left on the substitutes' bench for the duration of Manchester United's FA Cup defeat . Van Gaal and Falcao walk down the Old Trafford touchline after Manchester United's defeat by Arsenal . 'He scored four goals and has three or four assists, so that is his contribution,' said a clearly annoyed Van Gaal. 'And he stimulates also the other players, so that's also an aspect of the profession.' 'But it is now easy for you to say that (criticism of Falcao), and that's why you are saying that. And you are very happy to say that, I see that in your face.' Victor Valdes, on the other hand, has not made a senior appearance for United since finalising his move to Old Trafford at the beginning of January, while Rafael appears to be heading for the exit door.

David Moyes' Real Sociedad side ended their long wait for an away win in the Primera Division as they triumphed 1-0 at Getafe. Sociedad were the only La Liga side without a win on the road this season going into Monday's clash at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez, but they finally got that monkey off their backs courtesy of Inigo Martinez's second-half header. The Sociedad academy product rose highest to nod home Esteban Granero's accurate free-kick off a post in the 66th minute, although Getafe keeper Vicente Guaita will be disappointed at not being able to stop it. Inigo Martinez celebrates his second-half header which secured all three points for Real Sociedad . Martinez is mobbed by his Real Sociedad team-mates after scoring the only goal of the game on Monday . David Moyes pays tribute to the travelling fans after Real Sociedad claimed their first win on the road . Moyes' men have moved up to 10th in the table . Victory takes Sociedad up to 10th, level on 33 points with ninth-placed Espanyol, while Getafe remain 13th. Moyes' side, who like Getafe came into this game on the back of two wins and a defeat in their last three matches, saw plenty of ball early on but did little with it. The hosts looked sluggish during the opening exchanges, but they had a penalty appeal turned down in the ninth minute. Pedro Leon cut into the box and just as he looked to get it out of his feet and pull the trigger he was stopped in his tracks by a bumbling challenge from Sociedad centre-back Martinez. Referee Melero Lopez waved away the appeals, but the incident sparked Getafe into life and Quique Flores' side should have taken the lead when Alvaro Vazquez beat three defenders and then disappointingly toe-poked straight at Sociedad's grateful keeper Geronimo Rulli. Leon came within inches of opening the scoring after 20 minutes when he exquisitely curled onto the bar from the corner of the box.

Gonzalo Castro (right) and Getafe's defender Alexis Ruano battle for the ball during the Monday night clash . Moyes shakes hands with Getafe's head coach Pablo Franco ahead of the La Liga encounter . Rulli was beaten all ends up as the ambitious shot sailed over his head and he - as well as everyone else - no doubt expected it to miss the target comfortably, but a deceptive dip saw it drop down sharply and clip the frame of the goal. Imanol Agirretxe had a few headed chances as Sociedad began to show more in the final third, but Leon went close with a wicked shot from distance before Diego Castro was bravely thwarted by Rulli in a goalmouth scramble as it remained 0-0 at the interval. Sergio Canales starred as Sociedad upped the tempo in the second half, first rounding three defenders and then forcing a good save out of Guaita, before desperate defending blocked his goal-bound shot from hitting an empty net in the 57th minute. Martinez made the pressure count by leaping highest to head Granero's pinpoint free-kick in with the help of a post as Guaita got close to clawing it away after it bounced off his right upright, but fell just short of getting a good enough contact. With Getafe frustrations boiling over after the goal, Juan Rodriguez protested too loudly when his penalty appeal for a challenge by Martinez and Granero was rejected and he was duly booked by Lopez. The hosts frantically probed for an equaliser late on, with Mehdi Lacen again forcing Rulli into another good save with six minutes remaining, but Sociedad held out to finally get a reward on their travels.	Real Sociedad were the only La Liga side without a victory on the road . But Inigo Martinez's second-half goal secured three points for the visitors . David Moyes' side are 10th, level on points with ninth-placed Espanyol .
These shocking pictures show the inside of a squalid drug den littered with needles and packs of methadone in the Cornish town where Poldark is set. The disgusting images of a flat in Bodmin were taken after a woman and her boyfriend were evicted, leaving behind drug paraphernalia, condoms and piles of rubbish. The state of the property paints a darker picture of a town better known for being where the 18th century historical romance was set.

The disgusting images of a flat in Bodmin were taken after a woman and her boyfriend were evicted, leaving behind mouldy food, condoms and piles of rubbish . The state of the property paints a darker picture of a town better known for being where the 18th century historical romance was set . Crisp packets, empty fizzy drinks cans and plastic bags litter the floors of the squalid flat in the Cornish town . Bodmin, also known for its legendary beast, was where Poldark was set during its 1970s television adaptation . The grim photographs show debris piled up against the walls, with the floors of the heroin and crack cocaine den covered in needles, mouldy food and cigarette butts. The popular 1970s adaptations of the Poldark novels were set in the town, and a new BBC series based on the romantic novels was also filmed on Bodmin Moor. The first seven novels, set in the 18th centuries, tell the story of a Ross Poldark, a British Army officer who returns from the American Revolutionary War to find his fiancee, presuming he was dead, about to marry his cousin. The next five books focus on the children of the main characters and is largely set in the 19th century. Widely considered to be the one of the most successful television adaptations, Poldark is set to return to the BBC on Sunday with a new series. Many will be hoping the series encourages more tourists to the town, but the photographs from inside the drug den show it is not idyllic as the television programme makes it appear.

The two-bedroom flat's landlord Charlie Besenyi, 77, called the police after evicting the pair but was told that officers would not be able to help any further. He said: 'It was disgusting. I had never seen anything like it in my life. I was a good Samaritan and tried to help this woman who was living on the streets and she gave me a £125 a week through housing benefit. 'She stayed for five months with her boyfriend and the flat turned into a drug supermarket. There were always coming and goings and I knew something dodgy was going on. 'I have lived in Bodmin for 40 years and Cornwall is a beautiful place and I love it here. But it does have a darker side and a big problem with drugs that people on the outside probably don't realise. 'Show like Poldark show off Cornwall in a fantastic light which is good for the area. But what has happened here proves that the reality is somewhat different. 'I think this would shock a lot of people, which think of Cornwall as what they see on the television. Bodmin is full of druggies.' Kitchen surfaces were found smeared with grease inside the flat in Bodmin, which is tackling a drug problem . Many will be hoping the Poldark series encourages more tourists to the town, but photographs from inside the drug den show it is not idyllic as the television programme makes it appear . The landlord said Bodmin has a recognised drug problem and that dealers regularly target the town . Dirty clothes were piled up against the walls alongside rubbish, overflowing bins and unwashed pans . Shocking: One of the windows of the flat was smashed when the landlord evicted his tenants . 'After I evicted this woman and her boyfriend I opened the door and I was shocked. They ripped up everything and there was stuff everywhere. It has been disastrous.' There were more than 60 crimes involving drugs in Bodmin in the last year, as well as more than 700 anti-social behaviour offences and nearly 200 reports of criminal damage. A spokesman for tourist board Visit Cornwall said: 'Everywhere has its issues and there are always two sides to every story but Cornwall is incredibly beautiful with a stunning natural landscape and this is showcased wonderfully in the Poldark adaptation. 'The series is expected to offer Cornwall a real boost in terms of tourism which will provide a positive impact on the local economy.'

First lady Michelle Obama's recent trip to Cambodia this month cost taxpayers $242,500 – for hotel rooms alone – allowing her to perform her offical duties at two events for a total of 33 minutes. That's $7,348 of lodging costs for every minute on the job. A government contracting document shows that the State Department authorized spending nearly a quarter-million dollars so Mrs. Obama – traveiling with an entourage of high-ranking government officials and their security detail – could promote the 'Let Girls Learn' initiative, which girls' access to education. Transcripts provided to media by the White House Press Office indicate that Mrs. Obama spoke with a group of 10 girls at Hun Sen Bakorng High School for 21 minutes. After that appearance, she spoke at a Peace Corps Training Round Table event for 12 more minutes. That second appearance took place conveniently at the luxury five-star Sofitel Angkor Phokeethra Golf and Spa Resort in Siem Reap, Cabodia, where she was staying. The government booked 85 separate rooms for 14 nights, even though the first lady only stayed there for two. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO AND THE CONTRACTING DOCUMENT . The Sofitel Angkor Phokeethra Golf and Spa Resort, where . Michelle Obama and her retinue stayed this month, boasts Cambodia's largest free-form swimming pool . Don't forget to tip the butler! The US first lady left Siem Reap's international airport on March 22 after two nights at the five-star resort as part of a five-day Asia trip highlighting the importance of girls' education . FIVE STARS: Mrs. Obama's lodgings were among the finest Cambodia has to offer international tourists . The State Department ruled on March 3 that there was no time to solicit competitive bids for the March 21 trip, and ruled that the 'unusual and compelling urgency' of the first lady's travel justified a no-bid contract to the Sofitel resort. In addition to the 85 guest rooms, her trip to Siem Reap required five office suites, five 'sleeping suites' and a conference room. If Mrs. Obama stayed in one of those 'sleeping suites,' she had her own butler. They come standard. 'The Siem Reap hotel, which elegantly combines Khmer and French architectural design, features landscaped gardens, 5 restaurants and bars, meeting facilities, a luxury spa and the largest free form swimming pool in Cambodia,' the resort's website boasts. 'The leading luxury resort in Siem Reap also boosts a world-class 18-hole golf course at the Phokeethra Country Club, which is only a 25 min[ute] drive from the hotel.' Mrs. Obama made the most of what became the first trip by a sitting US president's wife to Cambodia, visiting Angkor Wat temple in Siem Reap province . And for tourist-minded spouses of world leaders, the hotel 'is close to the Angkor Temples, spectacular sunsets at the Bakheng Hill, Siem Reap River, Old market, 20 minutes away from the International Airport and just walking distance to Siem Reap National Museum.' She took full advantage, the White House Press Office relayed, visiting the temples at Angkor Wat when she wasn't meeting-and-greeting embassy staff. The first lady's lodging expenses in Cambodia were first reported by the Washington Free Beacon. They came at the tail end of a five-day Asia trip to promote girls' education. A few other smaller hotel contracts were awarded in Cambodia at the same time as the Sofitel's. The State Department justified the rush-job with hotel booking by noting that '[s]ecurity concerns prohibit sufficient advanced notification of VIP travel to allow for sufficient time to conduct full and open competition.' Michelle Obama walked with Cambodian first lady Bun Rany (right), the wife of Prime Minister Hun Sen, as they arrived at a school where they met with a group of 10 female students for 21 minutes . Mrs. Obama, her entourage and their security detail contemplated the 'crisis' of girls' education at a resort that features a swim-up bar . JUST LIKE HOME! President Obama's wife is accustomed to fine wines and cheese at the White House, and the Sofitel didn't disappoint . 'The Department of State can only communicate with the staff at Posts abroad when authorization is given due to security concerns. They have an extremely short turnaround time when authorization has been granted for negotiations to commence and site selections to be finalized with both the local vendors and Posts before the actual Senior High Level USG VIP visit occurs.' The contracting document referred to her as a 'Senior High Level USG [U.S. Government] VIP,' although the title of 'first lady' is honorary and has no official government function. Her accommodation arrangements, in fact, were apparently shoehorned into a generic form typically used for male VIPs. 'Security and logistical teams make determinations during the site survey as to which hotels are most suitable for the Senior High Level USG VIP and his traveling staff to remain overnight,' the contracting document reads.

Beef has been wiped off  restaurant menus across Mumbai after its state government said it will now enforce laws making possession of the meat and the slaughter of cows illegal. But steak and kidney pie will continue to be served up at one of India's oldest British Raj-era clubs in defiance of the ban. The law was passed by the state of Maharashtra around 20 years ago, but not implemented until now by a new Hindu nationalist administration. Still on the menu: The British Raj-era Royal Bombay Yacht Club (above) in Mumbai has vowed to continue serving steak and kidney pies despite a state-wide ban on the possession of beef or the slaughter of cows . Violators could face a fine and up to five years in prison. Residents expressed outrage on Twitter using the hashtag #BanBeef - which topped the social network's trends, appearing more than 22,000 times in less than 24 hours. But panicked steak lovers will have a safe haven at the Royal Bombay Yacht Club, Mumbai, which will continue to serve its steak and kidney pies to customers. The 170-year-old club has said it will keep steak on the menu by sticking to its original recipes using 'buff' - buffalo meat - rather than beef for the pies. Club president Ardhendu Bose felt pessimistic about the ban until he realised that the leaner buffalo meat used in their recipes would leave the club's menu intact, he told the Daily Telegraph. On Wednesday night, the club served both steak and kidney and steak and onion pies, with parsley potatoes and sautéed cauliflower to reassured customers. 'I spoke to my vice president and said "we should do something, we don't want to get into trouble". 'But he said buffalo is allowed, so we'll carry on as usual', he said. Loophole: The 170-year-old club has said it will keep steak on the menu by sticking to its original recipes using 'buff' - buffalo meat - rather than beef for the pies . The 112-year-old Taj Mahal Palace Hotel removed beef from the menus on Wednesday, according to chief sommelier Abhas Saxena - including its 'really sought-after' Chateaubriand steak. Mr Saxena said: 'Beef has been on the hotel's menu for many years. 'Our signature restaurants were affected by the ban so we will have to look again at the dynamics of their menus. 'Our Chateaubriand, the tornado - a cut of meat - the tenderloin, the veal, all of that has been removed. It will definitely affect our business.' He added: 'We still need to understand the thought process behind the ban. 'There are many segments of society being affected by this - from the folks who grow the cattle, to us who would be selling it.' Hindus, who make up 80 per cent of India's 1.2billion population, consider cows sacred. But large numbers of the population - particularly the extremes of the international elite and the poor - eat beef.	Ban passed 20 years ago, but only enacted now by new Hindu nationalists .

(CNN)Many years ago I performed at the Surf Ballroom, in Clear Lake, Iowa, which was the last stop on Buddy Holly's final tour. He was killed in a plane crash in 1959 that also took the lives of singers J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson and Ritchie Valens. By this time, Buddy Holly and I had had a pretty long history together. The concert that I performed at had all the old members of his group. Donna, who Ritchie Valens wrote a song about, was also there.  Peggy Sue, who Buddy Holly sang about, was there too. The Picks were there -- they sang background vocals on Buddy's records -- as well as singer Tommy Allsup, who claimed that years later he got his wallet back from the crash site. Unfortunately some fans at this show were selling crash-site photos, which I thought was in extremely bad taste. I think the prospect of the National Transportation Safety Board delving into the crash again, which might mean exhuming bodies and all the rest, would be in similarly bad taste. I think there's a reason we say, "rest in peace." Buddy Holly would have the same stature musically whether he would have lived or died, because of his accomplishments which, in retrospect, nobody -- and I mean nobody, not the Beatles the Rolling Stones or anyone else -- can beat, for these reasons: By the time he was 22 years old he had recorded some 50 tracks, most of which he had written himself and each of them, in my view and the view of many others, a hit. Buddy Holly and the Crickets were the template for all the rock bands that followed. No rock 'n' roll records can touch songs like "Rave On," "Think it Over," "Not Fade Away," "Peggy Sue" and many, many more. He was also a sensitive, ballad composer and singer, which people often overlook, with songs like "Moondreams" and "True Love Ways," among many. As a paperboy, I cut open the stack of papers on February 3, 1959, and saw that Buddy Holly had been killed in the plane crash. The next day I went to school in shock, and guess what? Nobody cared. Rock 'n roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy hadn't had a big hit on the charts since '57, nor had the others in the plane crash. Americans in those days were always looking ahead. Death was not lingered over. We'd had enough of that in World War II. Death and grief did not go with the exuberance and bright colors of the 1950s. Since then we have embarked on what I would call the "American death trip." One simply has to look at the slew of autopsy shows on television and the endless regurgitation of Marilyn, Elvis and JFK death details to get my point. Furthermore, because of the ever-growing psychological power of the media, we seem to think we can reach back half a century and touch things as if they are real. We live in a virtual nostalgic world because of this. Fortunately, Buddy Holly's music is forever young and all any young person has to do is listen to it and his life will be changed forever.	Don McLean: It's bad idea for NTSB to re-examine 1959 crash that killed Buddy Holly, "Big Bopper," Ritchie Valens . He says it's distasteful; they should "rest in peace" He says looking at crash case again is only part of the "American death trip" that pervades our culture .
