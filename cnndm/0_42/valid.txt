Lewis Hamilton is determined to' create history' again this Formula One season after insisting there is more to come despite a perfect start to the new year. Reigning world champion Hamilton claimed pole, fastest lap and race win in the opening grand prix of the campaign in Australia earlier this month. With team-mate Nico Rosberg second it was abundantly clear Mercedes will take some stopping again this term following a dominant 2014. Lewis Hamilton poses for a picture with a fan at a meet-and-greet session in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday . Hamilton is expected to go head-to-head with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg once more in 2015 . Hamilton has vowed to create history at Mercedes as he bids to win his third world championship . Mercedes set a new record for victories in a season with 16 from the 19 races, surpassing the prior mark of 15 set by McLaren in 1988 and Ferrari in 2002 and again in 2004. The German manufacturing giant also equalled Red Bull's 2011 record of 18 poles for the year, with their only blip in Austria where both Hamilton and Rosberg made errors to let in Williams' Felipe Massa. The worry for Mercedes' rivals this year is the team appear to have taken a step forward, with Hamilton showing no let up in his desire to make it three world titles. 'In terms of my performance I've got more to come,' said Hamilton ahead of this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix. 'I've been spending time with the engineers and I'm going to work really hard to understand. 'Last year when I went to Malaysia I went fresh. It was like my first race of the year. The British driver appeared in relaxed spirits as he sets sights on a third Formula One title . The Mercedes drivers look set to dominate the remainder of the season after setting the pace in Australia . Rosberg and Hamilton sign autographs for the dozens Mercedes-supporting fans in Malaysia . 'I went into the race not really knowing how long the tyres would last, but what happened turned out to be exceptional. 'After that race there was this big debrief and a document done to explain everything I did. 'Now I've won in Australia I'm going to extract everything from my data and see how I can better my performance. I definitely feel in this next race I can be better than I was last time out.' Asked of Hamilton whether it was Mercedes' target to win every race this season, he replied: 'The target's always been to win every race, even in the bad days. 'But this year we have an awesome car with improved reliability, so the target is to create history again.' Hamilton won in Malaysia last year ahead of Mercedes team-mate Rosberg . Hamilton is aware, however, of the potential perils and pitfalls that lie ahead which could scupper such aspirations. 'To pick up where we left off last year was awesome, but if 2014 showed us anything it's that putting together a whole season is never easy,' assessed Hamilton. 'Winning the first race is just one small step in a long journey and I'm not reading anything into it. 'The next step is Malaysia and that's all I've been focusing on since we left Melbourne. 'The race is really tough with the heat and humidity, but I feel ready for anything right now and the aim is to repeat last year's performance. 'It took me eight attempts to win this race before I finally made it to the top step last year. I don't plan on waiting that long again. 'From an outsider's perspective it appeared Hamilton crucially drew first blood in what is expected to be another intense season-long battle with Rosberg. Hamilton, though, suggested otherwise, stating: 'Psychologically it doesn't make any difference for me. 'I won the championship again last year, and I felt like it wasn't a fluke. I'm deserving of where I am. 'And I worked damn hard to get that win in Australia. Again there wasn't any luck involved.'	Lewis Hamilton heads into Malaysian Grand Prix leading the championship .

Marouane Fellaini has revealed his ultimate five-a-side team - and there's even a spot for his old Everton pal Sylvain Distin alongside just one of his Manchester United team-mates. The Belgium international, 27, is back to playing his best football having endured a difficult start to life at Old Trafford following his £27.5million arrival from Everton 18 months ago. He has become a key figure in manager Louis van Gaal's plans, scoring four goals to help fourth-placed United maintain their quest for a return to the Champions League next season. Manchester United and Belgium midfielder Marouane Fellaini has picked his ultimate five-a-side team . Fellaini, pictured during a photshoot for New Balance Football, has been in excellent form in recent weeks . Former Everton star Fellaini includes one of his Manchester United team-mates in his dream five-a-side team . He impressed in United's 2-1 win over Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday and has now linked up with his international team-mates ahead of their forthcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers against Cyprus and Israel. Fellaini, however, was unable to accommodate the likes of Belgian pals Eden Hazard, Vincent Kompany or Thibaut Courtois in his ultimate fives team. He failed to find room for himself and the likes of Wayne Rooney, Angel di Maria and Robin van Persie too. Yet he did manage to select one United colleague in his fearsome starting line-up. Sylvain Distin is Marouane Fellaini's best friend and he says the Everton defender is a great player . Fellaini's United team-mate David De Gea has been in superb form this season and gets a place in goal . Real Madrid midfielder Zinedine Zidane nets a superb volley against Bayer Leverkusen in 2002 . 'The keeper? I play with good keepers, it is hard to pick!' said Fellaini, speaking exclusively to Sportsmail as part of the launch for the first New Balance Football advert. 'But the keeper I choose... it has to be (David) De Gea. I need a defender too, so I will choose Sylvain Distin. 'He is my best mate and a great player as well. And then it has to be (Zinedine) Zidane, (Lionel) Messi, (Cristiano) Ronaldo.' It is no surprise to see Lionel Messi (above) and Cristiano Ronaldo (below) in Fellaini's five-a-side dream team . Indeed a formidable five-a-side team and one the towering Belgian cannot fit himself into. Although Hazard fails to make the cut, Fellaini believes the Chelsea star has been the best player in the Barclays Premier League this season. Jose Mourinho's side have a six-point lead at the top of the table, with a game in hand and Fellaini expects his compatriots Courtois and Hazard will be toasting glory in May. 'At the moment, Eden Hazard has been the best player in the Premier League,' said Fellaini. 'I think Chelsea will win the title.' Fellaini says Eden Hazard has been the Premier League's best player this season while Chelsea will win title .

Public transport was free in Paris today and half of the city's cars were forced off the road in a bid to fight pollution. In a radical move which will be studied in other European capitals like London, French Socialists said everything had to be done to make air cleaner. Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, said: 'I am delighted the state has agreed to put in place a partial driving ban on Monday, which I have been requesting for several days.' Scroll down for video . Public transport was free in Paris today and half of the city's cars were forced off the road in a bid to fight pollution . Only vehicles with number plates ending in an odd number were allowed, with exemptions for taxis, electric cars and ambulances. Authorities were planning to ban cars with even numbers on Tuesday, but the scheme was halted following improving forecasts. Foreign visitors to Paris, including thousands of Britons on holiday, were also permitted to use their cars. But police patrols were seen booking locals who flouted the ban, forcing them to return home. Meanwhile, Metro trains and buses were full to overflowing as thousands abandoned their vehicles. 'There are horrific crushes on the trains,' said Jean Babin, a 43-year-old commuter from the suburb of Juvisy, who usually travels to the city in his Renault. 'Free transport is a great idea in principle but it can potentially cause a number of problems of its own, and you do wonder who is going to pay for it all'. Air quality monitors showed concentrations of potentially dangerous particulates in the Pars air were above the recommended maximum. Only vehicles with number plates ending in an odd number were allowed, with exemptions for taxis, electric cars and ambulances . Police patrols were seen booking locals who flouted the ban, forcing them to return home. Meanwhile, Metro trains and buses were full to overflowing as thousands abandoned their vehicles . These are created by cars and lorries, heating and heavy industry, and can potentially cause serious health problems. 'Due to the improving situation today and tomorrow, the alternative traffic (plan) will not be renewed Tuesday,' announced Ecology Minister Segolene Royal, who took time to salute 'the good citizenship of motorists who understood the necessity of this measure.' The Airparif monitoring agency said smog density was still near alert levels Monday, but rain forecast for Tuesday was expected to clear the air. Though public transport is free of charge to take the sting out of the restrictions, drivers in the capital have protested against the measure, despite it having been used only twice since 1997. Paris area is confronting an increasingly troubling air pollution problem, caused by vehicles, heating and heavy industry . Similar emergency restrictions were last implemented almost exactly a year ago - on March 17 - during a particularly bad spike in the pollution levels. Paris area is confronting an increasingly troubling air pollution problem, caused by vehicles, heating and heavy industry. Authorities measure the concentration of particulates with a diameter of less than 10 microns - so-called PM10 - in the air to determine pollution levels. The safe limit for PM10 is set at 80 microgrammes per cubic metre (mcg/m3), with levels in Paris Monday expected to be somewhere between 40 and 55 mcg/m3. The city's alert level is fixed at 50 mcg/m3. According to a 2011 World Health Organisation report, the planet's most polluted city was Ahvaz in Iran with an average of 372 mcg/m3. Beijing had an average of 121 mcg/m3, while Paris was measured at 38 mcg/m3.	Only vehicles with number plates ending in an odd number were allowed .

The wife of a passenger on missing the MH370 flight plane has spoken of her heartache, revealing she is still desperate for answers a year after the airliner vanished. It has been 12 months to the day since Perth father Paul Weeks boarded the Beijing-bound flight in Kuala Lumpur and his wife Danica Weeks is still at a loss about what to tell her young boys - and where their beloved father has gone. Ms Weeks said despite being advised by people that she needs to tell Lincoln, 4, and Jack, 2, what happened to him, she refuses to lie to their sons and will wait until the truth is discovered. Scroll down for video . Danica Weeks doesn't know what to say to her sons Lincoln, 4, and Jack, 2 about where their daddy has gone . Paul Weeks boarded the MH370 flight a year ago . 'People say you've got to tell them the truth and I say "do you?" because I don't and I'm not going to put them through what I think it is then it turns out to be something completely different – and I will choose to tell them,' she told The Sydney Morning Herald. Ms Weeks described the past year as 'surreal' and a 'blur' without being able to see, or even say farewell, to her 'best friend'. 'I'm just this housewife wanting her amazing husband. He did so much for us as a family and he would do exactly the same if he was in my shoes – he would want to bring us home – and I'll do it for him, he deserves it,' she said. Her mining engineer husband, who was on his way to start a new job in Mongolia when the plane inexplicably vanished, gave her his wedding ring when they said their goodbyes at the airport on Marhc 8, 2014. Ms Weeks said she could not have survived the trauma of the past 12 months if it wasn't for the support of the Western Australian community. She added that it has been impossible to begin the mourning process and even think about moving on. 'Even for the children, we haven't even had a memorial or had a chance to say our goodbyes,' she said. '[Since MH370] There have been two plane crashes and they get the bodies home – we don't even get a piece of the plane.' This comes as China's Foreign minister vowed to never give up looking for the plane while Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the search can't go on forever. Other officials said discussions were already under way between countries involved in the search as to whether to call off the hunt in coming weeks. Mr Weeks gave his wife (right) his wedding ring (left) before boarding the MH370 flight . Officials said discussions were already under way between the countries as to whether to call off the hunt within weeks for the missing plane . As his country said prayers on Sunday for those who were on board the missing flight, Malaysia's Prime Minister said no words could describe their pain. 'The lack of answers and definitive proof - such as aircraft wreckage - has made this more difficult to bear,' said Mr Najib Razak. 'No words can describe the pain the families of those on board are going through.' China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, said in Beijing that the search for the Malaysia Airlines flight which vanished one year ago today will not stop. 'The search for MH370 will continue,' said Mr Wang, echoing the previously-spoken commitment of the countries involved in the hunt for the aircraft - Australia, Malaysia and China - in the southern Indian Ocean. Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak (left) said no words could describe the country's pain, whilst Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott (right) called it 'one of the great mysteries of the 21st century' Ms Weeks says she refuses to lie to their sons and will wait until the truth is discovered . While China and Malaysia vow to search for as long as it takes to find the aircraft . In Kuala Lumpur, Mr Najib spoke of the joint effort, adding in his official statement that 'together with our international partners, we have followed the little evidence that exists. 'Malaysia remains committed to the search and hopeful that MH370 will be found.' Although Mr Abbott said he was confident the aircraft would be found as 40 per cent of 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of Western Australian had been scrutinised and another 60,000sq km to be covered if necessary, he added that the search had to end at some stage. 'It is one of the great mysteries of the 21st century and I know that there will be a nagging doubt in the minds of billions of people until such time as we can find that plane,' he told reporters in Sydney on Sunday. 'It can't go on forever but, as long as there are reasonable leads, the search will go on.'

Daniel Vettori became the 12th player to take 300 one-day international wickets as New Zealand eased to a six-wicket victory against Afghanistan. The 36-year-old, who took an impressive 4-18, is the first New Zealander to pass the landmark and now sits in the esteemed company of greats such as Muttiah Muralitharan, Wasim Akram and Glenn McGrath. Afghanistan required a seventh-wicket partnership of 86 between Najibullah Zadran and Samiullah Shenwari to post a respectable 186 all out, having chosen to bat, but a 19-ball 42 from Brendon McCullum ensured there would be no shock in Napier. Daniel Vettori became the 12th player to take 300 one-day international wickets . Vettori of New Zealand celebrates taking the wicket of Afsar Zazai of  Afghanistan at the Cricket World Cup . Vettori  celebrates with Brendon McCullum after taking the wicket of Zazai  during the Cricket World Cup match . Perhaps a mark of the man and an added insight into the where the focus of the team remains, Vettori said the landmark was something he would think about after the World Cup. 'Right now we are caught up in the middle of a World Cup,' he said. 'We have an important game on Friday (group game against Bangladesh), and then probably the most important of our careers the following Saturday (quarter-final). 'Maybe in a month, it will be the time to look back on it. I didn't go into the World Cup thinking about that milestone, I didn't believe I would take this many wickets in this few games.' Understandably stung from being smashed for a record-breaking 417 runs by Australia in Perth days earlier, Mohammad Nabi chose to bat after calling correctly at the toss. Afghanistan were made to pay for a choice that signaled a slight naivety within the camp, with their own coaching staff having previously admitted that bowling was the side's strong suit. The newcomers to the World Cup stage collapsed to 34-3 and then 59-6, as Vettori caused most of the damage after Trent Boult had Javed Ahmadi trapped lbw for just one. McCullum has developed into an imposing captain, known for his ingenuity and outrageously attacking fields – so his decision to bowl his spinner in just the third over was met with mild surprise. The decision was less genius and more to allow New Zealand's opening bowlers, Tim Southee and Boult, to switch ends. The 36-year-old is the first New Zealander to pass the landmark of 300 ODI wickets . New Zealand eased to a six-wicket win over Afghanistan at the Cricket World Cup on Sunday . He now sits in the company of greats such as Muttiah Muralitharan, Wasim Akram and Glenn McGrath . Vettori of New Zealand speaks at a post-match press conference following their Cricket World Cup win . Still, Vettori showed that he's as accurate in the third over as in the 15th as he struck with his first ball. Usman Ghani lost sight of the ball and saw his off stump disturbed. With his opening strike bowlers having switched ends, McCullum resumed the pace attack, and Asghar Stanikzai could only send a short ball from Boult into the geelful clutches of Martin Guptil. Southee, struggling with his line and length, was replaced by Vettori, who took No.300 by bowling Nawroz Mangal for 27 with the first ball of his third over. The Auckland-born spinner was on a roll and had Nabi (6) and Afsar Zazai dismissed off consecutive balls. Nabi was caught at slip, while Zazai was trapped leg before. That brought Najibullah to the crease for the hat-trick ball, and the batsman was welcomed by the sight of nine men around his bat, with no fielder outside the circle. However, he survived and showed maturity beyond his years in his partnership with Shenwari before departing after a run-a-ball 56 that ended when he top-edged a short and wide bouncer from Adam Milne to Vettori at third man. New Zealand's Ross Taylor gets a handshake from Afghanistan's Hamid Hassan (left) after the match . New Zealand are very much on course to end their World Cup victory drought . Shenwari, undoubtedly Afghanistan's best batsman in this tournament, was the anchor of his side's innings, and he made 54 off 110 balls before falling to Corey Anderson. An entertaining cameo from Hamid Hassan (16 off 21) took Afghanistan to 186, but for the fifth consecutive World Cup match New Zealand bowled out their opposition. The number of orange target T-shirts seemed to double after the resumption of play with the crowd undoubtedly expecting McCullum to send a few balls into the stand and help them earn a share of the pot of money for the 'one-handed crowd catch' promotion. But McCullum cleared the rope just once in his innings before being bowled by Nabi with one that kept a touch low. His departure unsurprisingly slowed the run chase, and when Kane Williamson picked out midwicket off Shapoor Zardan for 33, the Afghans believed they had a chance. Two comical run-outs saw Martin Guptill (57) and Grant Elliott (19) further add to the nerves of the McLean Park crowd, but Ross Taylor, the birthday boy, held his nerve to steer New Zealand home. The same side, the same outcome, the same feeling after the match – New Zealand are very much on course to end their World Cup victory drought.

The Supreme Court has given a former UPS driver another chance to prove her claim of discrimination after the company did not offer her lighter duties while she was pregnant. On a 6-3 vote, the justices on Wednesday revived Peggy Young's discrimination claim against UPS and sent the case back to a lower court. The case concerned employers' responsibilities under the 37-year-old Pregnancy Discrimination Act. Atlanta-based UPS maintained that it obeyed the law because it provided light-work duty only in limited situations and did not single out pregnant women. Peggy Young (pictured in December last year), a Virginia woman who lost her UPS job because she became pregnant, speaks to reporters outside the Supreme Court in Washington, DC. The Supreme Court is giving the former UPS driver another chance to prove her claim of discrimination after the company did not offer her lighter duty when she was pregnant . But the company changed its policy as of January and said it now tries to accommodate pregnant workers. The justices gave Young another chance to litigate whether UPS should have granted her request for temporary changes in work duties - she asked not to lift heavier packages - after she became pregnant in 2006. Writing on behalf of the majority, liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said the lower court is required to determine if the employer had 'legitimate, nondiscriminatory, nonpretextual justification' for treating employees differently. Breyer said the lower court failed to consider the effects of UPS policies that covered non-pregnant workers who might have disabilities, injuries or otherwise might need accommodations, and asked, 'Why, when the employer accommodated so many, could it not accommodate pregnant women as well?' Breyer said there is a 'genuine dispute as to whether UPS provided more favorable treatment to at least some employees whose situation cannot reasonably be distinguished from Young's'. The outcome reflects a 'middle ground' that Justice Elena Kagan suggested during arguments in early December. Courts must now re-examine Young's case with a more accepting view of the discrimination claim. A federal district court judge and an appeals court had ruled in favor of UPS, which was backed by business groups in the case. The two sides in the case disagreed over whether UPS agreed to accommodate non-pregnant workers requesting light-duty assignments. UPS and other employers facing similar suits still are able to argue their policies were legal because they were based on seniority or some other acceptable reason. The case concerned whether the package delivery company violated a federal law, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, by denying Young's request. Young, who worked at a Maryland facility, had acted on a midwife's advice that she not be required to lift packages weighing more than 20 pounds (9 kg). Young, now 43, said she dealt almost exclusively with overnight letters, but UPS said its drivers must be able to lift packages weighing up to 70 pounds. Young left the company in 2009. The Virginia woman lost two rounds in lower courts. UPS has since changed its policy, and now says it will try to accommodate pregnant workers. Nine states also have adopted laws directing employers to do so. In recent months, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has updated guidance to employers to make clear that they should accommodate people in Young's situation. Yet the U.S. Postal Service said it has made no change in policy and maintains the practice that UPS has now abandoned. Supporters of Peggy Young, a Virginia woman who lost her UPS job because she became pregnant, attend a rally outside the Supreme Court in DC in December. The justices found in Young's favor on Wednesday .	On a 6-3 vote, the justices on Wednesday revived Peggy Young's discrimination claim against UPS and sent the case back to a lower court . Young's dispute with UPS arose in 2006 after she gave her supervisor a doctor's note recommending that she not lift packages heavier than 20lb .
How France manager Didier Deschamps must wish he had this group of legends to call upon in his quest for Euro 2016 glory. Thierry Henry, Marcel Desailly, Zinedine Zidane and Patrick Vieira all took to the Stade de France turf before France's defeat to Brazil on Thursday night to celebrate their position as national centurions. Together, they are four of just six players to be capped more than 100 times by Les Bleus, with Deschamps another and all-time leader Lilian Thuram making up the list.

The group are just four of the six players to have appeared more than 100 times for France . Henry (left) shares a joke on the Stade de France pitch with former international team-mate Desailly . All four players are also World Cup and European Championship winners with France . Lilian Thuram - 142 caps . Thierry Henry - 123 . Marcel Desailly- 116 . Zinedine Zidane - 108 . Patrick Vieira - 107 . Didier Deschamps - 103 . Thuram possesses 142 caps, with Henry second on 123 and defender Desailly third with 116. Zidane is next up with 108, then Vieira on 107 and finally current boss Deschamps on 103. And of the six, four started the 1998 World Cup final on the same Paris pitch where they became champions, while Vieira came off the bench during the 3-0 triumph and Henry was an unused substitute - although he was France's top scorer in the tournament with three goals. All six of them also started the final as France beat Italy 2-1 in extra-time to win Euro 2000.

Chelsea's Oscar levelled the game later in the half, before Neymar and Luiz Gustavo struck after the interval. It was a frustrating result for Deschamps, who kept his job despite seeing France crash out at the quarter-final stage to eventual champions Germany during last summer's World Cup. And with Euro 2016 set to be played on home turf, there will be precious few games for him to prepare for an assault at glory, with friendlies against Belgium and Albania in June before a trip to Wembley to face England in November.

(CNN)Are the upcoming elections in Israel crucial? Will the results -- a fourth term for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or a first for opposition leader Isaac Herzog -- change Israel's policy in a significant way? As Israelis prepare to go to the polls, the answer seems to be negative. Many observers in Europe and the United States seem to be under the impression that during Netanyahu's time in power, Israel was hijacked by right wing zealots -- and that Herzog, leader of the Zionist Union opposition party, is the man who will save the country and return it to the path of sanity. But the fact is that when it comes to the most crucial question regarding the future of Israel and the Middle East -- what to do about the Palestinians -- the difference between the two candidates is negligible, a divergence that is short on substance but long on style and rhetoric. While Netanyahu's insistence on Israel's continued ruling over millions of Palestinians is expressed in aggressive, often religious and nationalistic language, Herzog's justifications for doing the same thing would sound much softer and easier to digest in the Western world. But at the end of the day, neither Netanyahu nor Herzog have any real intention to put an end to the occupation of the Palestinian territories. Netanyahu says it clearly and openly; Herzog and his coalition partners only hint at it. READ MORE: 5 key issues for next Israeli leader . This whitewash has been so evident throughout the entire election campaign that a foreigner arriving in Israel would have had a hard time understanding anything about what is really going on here. The main issues that have been discussed during the campaign are economic ones -- cost of living, housing prices, government oversight -- but even then, slogans and populist promises have largely replaced the in-depth debates we should be having. But the topics that seem to have consumed most of the headlines range from pure gossip to scandals, some of them concerning the behavior of Netanyahu and his wife Sara. There was the "bottlegate" affair -- claims that the wife of the Prime Minister had pocketed cash from bottle recycling at their official residence. The Netanyahus say they reimbursed the government. Israel is a country that is still looking for its way forward; one that lacks internationally recognized borders; one that has not yet decided whether it is a Western society or a Middle Eastern one; one that cannot decide whether it wants to be religious or secular, Jewish or bi-national. All of these critical issues -- none of them decided on -- have been cast aside, ignored, covered up or denied by a country that has busied itself with the important business of recycled bottles at the prime minister's residence. There is a big elephant in the room, but Israel is turning its back to it. There is a big elephant in the room, but Israel believes that if nobody talks about it, the elephant does not exist. This elephant is absent from the Israeli discourse on a day-to-day basis, and it is absent during elections -- a time when public discourse should be only be focused on what really matters. The elephant in the Israeli room is the unending occupation of Palestinian territories, and nobody is talking about it. Most of the parties running in the elections have not even bothered to try to answer questions about what their plans are for the Palestinians. But the occupation also continues to be a non-issue for too many ordinary Israelis, who know very little -- and care even less -- about the cruel reality for the millions of Palestinians who live without civil rights in the West Bank and who are kept under siege in Gaza. For those who regard Herzog and the center-left as the great hope of this campaign, it is important to remember that it was the Israeli Labor Party who established the occupation and settlement projects in Palestinian territory. Golda Meir, Moshe Dayan, Shimon Peres, Yitzhak Rabin: Those Labor leaders, so beloved by the West, are the founding fathers of the most significant venture of modern Israel -- the illegal transfer of a Jewish population to stolen land. It was a project whose purpose was to prevent any kind of equal division of the land, or a settlement with the Palestinians -- and as such it has been a great success story. Labor never had a real plan for the Palestinians, except to time and again renew the endless peace process, which may be the longest in history. This is still true now, on the eve of elections that stand a real chance of bringing the Zionist Union to power. The more than 500,000 settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem have created what may be an irreversible reality, but Herzog's only answer to it is to get back to the negotiation table. In private circles he mentions five years as the time he needs to conclude the process. There is no better indication that Herzog has no intention of ending the occupation any time soon. Numerous peace plans have already been worked out in great detail; all that is needed is for one courageous Israeli leader to implement any one of them. Herzog, at least at this stage, does not seem to be the one capable of doing this. On Tuesday the "only democracy in the Middle East" will elect a new parliament and a new government, in what is frequently described as a celebration of "people power." But the reality is that here in Israel, it is only the masters who will vote and decide on the future -- not only for themselves, but for the millions of Palestinians who have for nearly half a century been living under their control, directly in the West Bank and indirectly in Gaza. And yet, it seems, their fate is not a topic worthy of discussion. To call this a democracy in 2015 is rather problematic.

New video footage has emerged of tourists fleeing in fear after they hear the sounds of gunshots following a terror attack on a Tunisian museum. The terrifying short film shows how the visitors are enjoying a guided tour of the National Bardo Museum in Tunis before gunshots are fired, making the group jolt with surprise. Initially not sure what is happening, they hesitate and the tour stands still - but as the horror dawns on them, the group begin to run for their lives. Terror: Two tourists hold tightly onto each other as they run away from the sounds of gunshots during the attack on the National Bardo Museum in Tunis, Tunisia . Disturb: The Italian group were being given a guided tour on the museum when they were disrupted by the sound of gunshots . Attack: The camera points towards the sound of the gunshots, where terrorists had opened fire on unsuspecting visitors. Isis have claimed responsibility for attack which killed 21 people . Italian publication La Repubblica posted the footage, which was shot on a device owned by tourists Marcello and Maria Rita Salvatori. The camera continues to roll as the tourists sprint away from the sound of gun shots, before congregating in hushed quiet in a small room as they try to work out what has happened. The new footage has emerged on the same day as Tunisian government and museum officials announced they have had to delay the re-opening of the centre because of security concerns. Afraid: The tourists huddle together after rushing away from the sound of guns being fired, and stay quiet to try and work out what is happening above . Head of communications at the museum Hanene Srarfihas revealed she expected the museum to open on Sunday instead. She said: 'We have been surprised at the last minute, but the interior ministry says that for security reasons we cannot receive a large number of visitors.' However an official ceremony marking the reopening of the museum went ahead on Tuesday as planned and was attended by Tunis residents, urging tourists to return to their country. Protest: Tunisians gather outside the National Bardo Musuem to demonstrate and plead for tourists to visit the country again . Demonstration: The campaigners carried signs and placards outside the centre, which was attacked by terrorists last week. Isis have claimed responsibility . Unsafe: While a ceremonial re-opening of the National Bardo Museum took place on Tuesday, security fears mean authorities had to cancel its formal re-opening to the public . Tension: A woman wrapped in the flag of Tunisia chants slogans during the demonstrations outside the National Bardo Museum, while security forces carrying guns control the entrance to the centre in Tunis . They shouted slogans and held placards, some of which read: 'Visit Tunisia' and 'Muslims are not terrorists'. Another said: 'I'm Tunisian. Islam is my religion and I love you ALL. Visit Tunisia. Peace.' Innocent: Tunisian children chant during the reopening of the Bardo Museum following deadly attacks in Tunis . Dress: Tunisians dressed in traditional costumes gather outside the National Bardo Museum during ceremonial reopening . The terror attack killed 21 people - including 17 cruise ship tourists - and two gunmen were killed by police. On Sunday Tunisia's president President Beji Caid Essebsi said a third attacker - the suspected mastermind - is still on the run following the massacre. Tight security: Tunisia's national museum (pictured with heavily armed Tunisian policemen on guard outside) has delayed a planned reopening after last week's attack on foreign tourists due to security concerns . Footage: News of the delayed reopening comes after a CCTV video was released showing a pair of gunmen roaming the Bardo, and appearing to allow one visitor to go free . Bardo curator Moncef Ben Moussa said that the museum is delaying the reopening, and it will probably reopen on Sunday instead. He did not elaborate on what prompted the last-minute change, citing only logistics and security. Authorities have arrested several people in the attack, the worst in Tunisia in 13 years, and are still hunting for the suspected mastermind. Officials have said none of the museum's major archaeological treasures suffered damage. Over the weekend President said the attack involved 'three aggressors' and the third man escaped. He was speaking live with French network iTele from inside the museum. Suspects have been arrested over the attack but it was previously believed just two gunmen launched the attack on the museum. The news comes after a video was released of the pair roaming the Bardo. The one-minute video posted on the government's Interior Ministry Facebook page shows the two men scurrying through the Tunis museum, carrying assault rifles and bags. Statement: On Sunday Tunisia's president President Beji Caid Essebsi (pictured) said a third attacker - the suspected mastermind - is still on the run following the massacre . Shattered: The walls and windows were peppered with bullet holes while unused grenades lay scattered among debris following last week's attack on the Bardo Museum in Tunis . One of the attackers is wearing a baseball cap and a heavy jacket, while the other wears a red hooded jumper and tracksuit pants. At one point, they encounter another man with a backpack walking down a flight of stairs. They briefly acknowledge each other and let the unidentified man walk free before unleashing the deadly attack in the country's largest museum. The video also shows stills of the dead gunmen - named as Yassine Laabidi and Hatem Khachnaou - who were killed in a firefight with security forces, including a picture indicating at least one was wearing an explosive belt. Police responding to the attack shot and killed the two gunmen. They were identified as Tunisians in their 20s who had trained in Libya. Essebsi said the extremists who have recruited about 3,000 Tunisians to fight in Iraq and Syria have no credible connection to Islamic belief. He said his country was at war with them. 'When war is brought upon us, we will wage war,' he said. Yassine al-Abidi had breakfast with his family as normal on morning he and his fellow terrorist Hatem Khachnaoui attacked the Bardo museum last Wednesday killing 21 people and injuring more than 60 others . Graphic: Al-Abidi and Hatem Khachnaoui pictured were both killed after a four-hour standoff with special forces . ISIS claimed Wednesday's attack on foreign tourists in Tunis, the deadliest involving foreigners in Tunisia since a 2002 suicide bombing on the island of Djerba. Tunisian fighters make up a disproportionately high number of foreign recruits to ISIS in Syria, with as many as 10,000 having signed up. The government said the two gunmen had trained in jihadi camps in Libya before the attack inside the heavily secured Tunisian parliament compound. Police in Tunisia have arrested five people described as directly tied to the two gunmen. Four others said to be supporters of the cell were also arrested in central Tunisia, not far from where a group claiming allegiance to al Qaida's North African branch has been active. ISIS issued a statement and audio on jihadi websites applauding the dead gunmen as 'knights' for their 'blessed invasion of one of the dens of infidels and vice in Muslim Tunisia'. As investigations into the massacre continue, Tunisian security officials have been asked why the world-famous museum was completely unprotected. The government now plans to deploy the army to major cities to bolster security following the shootings.	New video shows moment tourist group hear the gunmen opening fire .

Millions of male workers who leave their rural homes to work in large cities can only have sex with their wives for a fortnight every year. At least 47 million women live in rural China while their husbands work away - leaving them desperate for intimacy when they return. 'All I can think of when returning home for Chinese New Year is sex,' one migrant claimed. And now a series of photographs, taken in Shangnan County in Shaanxi Province, has captured the moment many of these migrants return to their own bedrooms. Wang Libao (right) and wife Zhu Chunlian (left): When Mr Wang is away, his wife and children sleep on a 1.5-metre-wide bed. But when he’s home, the two children are sent to stay with grandparents . Wang Libao, 34, and his 30-year-old wife, Zhu Chunlian,  got married in 2003, according to a report by People’s Daily.   . Mr Wang works in a gold mine in Lingbao, Henan Province, in central China. He said that because he does not visit his wife in their three-bedroom house very often their two children are sent to stay with grandparents when he returns. Although he has been back for a few days, Mrs Wang said she is already trying to persuade her husband to stay for three more. Wu Maojiang (left) and wife Wang Xiaojing: Mr Wu says he spends about 20 days with his wife every year . Similarly Wu Maojiang, 36, only gets to spent 20 days with his wife Wang Xiaojing a year. The couple got married in 2006 and have a daughter, 8, and a five-year-old son. In 2013, Mr Wu spent ¥36,000 (£3,820) buying a five-bedroom house for his family. But as Mr Wu has works away, including in Shanxi, Shaanxi and Henan provinces in central China, it is his father who lives with his wife and children. Jiang Quanbao (right) and wife: In order to support the entire family, Mr Jiang has been working even though he is very sick . But for some couples it is not just working away that prevents sex. Work injuries are also common as migrants choose to take on dangerous, but high-paid, jobs such as coal mining. Jiang Quanbao, 45, works at different coal and gold mines. He does not get to spend much time with his wife, who he married five years ago. A few years ago Mr Jiang was suffering from back pain when his body collapsed. The doctors told him he had kidney stones and would require surgery. Mr Jiang said he and his wife now don’t have sex life because of his poor health. Qiao Chengfeng (right) and wife Zhang Juan (left): Mr Qiao, who got pneumoconiosis from long-time mining, cannot go out for work any more. Due to health, he has not had sex with his wife for two years . Qiao Chengfeng used to work at different mines. He is suffering from pneumoconiosis and doesn't have the strength to lift a bag of rice. The 31-year-old said although he sleeps with his wife Zhang Juan, 27, every day on the same bed, he has not been able to have sex with her for two years. On hearing this, his wife, who he married in 2005, turns around to weep. Jiang Kun (left) and wife: Mr Jiang and his late father are both miners. He has decided to stay at home for two more weeks in order to spend time with family . Jiang Kun, 31, who is also a miner, said the reason many men spend so much time away from home is because it is not possible to feed the whole family by working in a nearby factory. He added that this decision was made despite many men being aware of the dangers of coal mining. Mr Jiang’s wife is two years younger than him. The two have a nine-year-old son and a seven-year-old daughter. He said he decided to return to work after the Lantern Festival, the fifteenth day after Chinese New Year, because he wants to spend more time with his family. Huang Jiao (left) with her daughter and mother in law their house. Ms Huang's husband left home in central China on the eighth day of Chinese New Year to return to his factory in southern China . But it is not just couples who have been together for years that are affected. Huang Jiao, 26, got married around six months ago. Her husband works in an electronic factory in Guangdong in southern China and earns some ¥3,000 (£318) every month. Ms Huang said every year she only has opportunity to ‘be with my husband’ for a handful of days – the same applies for most of her female neighbours. Zhu Xianshun (left), whose wife died 14 years ago, is taking care of his paralysed mother-in-law. He has given up the idea of re-marrying . Zhu Xianshun, 64, has been supporting his wife’s parents since his wife died 14 years ago. His father-in-law passed away and his mother-in-law, 85, is now paralysed. Mr Zhu, who has four children, thought of re-marrying but has given up the idea. He says no woman would want to marry a man like him. Yang Fan (left) and wife: The couple married three years ago and now have a little daughter . Yang Fan, 22, married wife Chuan Zhenzhao in May 2012 and now have a little daughter. Mr Yang did not graduate high school as he went out with his father to work. Because they both are working in coal industry, the family is financially stable. The Yang family even bought a pickup truck – a luxury for people with his background. Mr Huang (right) and his wife: Mr Huang suffers from pneumoconiosis while his wife and daughter work in Xi'an . Mr Huang, 48, suffers from pneumoconiosis. He got the disease from working in coal mining and was diagnosed in 2009. In 2014 he developed a more serious illness. Mr Huang says that this disease cannot be cured and many of his colleagues have died. His wife Chen Qiuqin and his daughter work in Xi’an, the provincial capital of Shaanxi. His youngest son is studying in a university in Xi’an. The bedroom of Zhang Chengjun, 28, who works as a welder in Guangdong . Zhang Chengjun, 28, shows his bedroom. Mr Zhang works in Guangdong and is a master of welding. He left home with his wife and four year old son. Mr Zhang father says long-term separation is not an option for young couples. Although it’s expensive to support the wife and child in the city, the family will be more stable and the couple happier.	At least 47 million wives live in rural China while husbands work away .

The 36-year-old footballer allegedly upset Sikh priest, Jasvinder Singh and his wife when he reversed his car over the garden of the temple ground and parked in Mr Singh's personal car park. The priest tried to confront Cousins before he took off again and stopped a few metres ahead to take photos of the temple. 'Again, I tried to talk to him and he started his car,' Mr Singh said. 'I called the police and then I followed him again and he stopped his car in the middle of the road and then some cars almost hit him.' Mr Singh then became alarmed by the behaviour and left it to the police. 'He was not looking stable.' Footage emerged this week showing Cousins running through the streets away from police .

A size 28 woman who was told she could die if she didn't lose weight has been crowned slimmer of the year - after shedding more than eight stone. Georgina Wallace, from Feltham, London, was told by the doctor treating her mother for a fatal heart attack that the 39-year-old faced the same fate if she didn't eat more healthily. Tipping the scales at 18 stone, Miss Wallace, a marketing manager, said food was her only comfort  after her father was diagnosed with terminal bowel cancer, and her mother died. Scroll down for video . Georgina Wallace (pictured weighing 18 stone, left, and 10 stone, right) has been named Slimming World's Consultant Slimmer of the Year 2015 . Georgia couldn't contain her happiness today when she posed alongside a life size cut out of herself having lost a considerable amount of weight . She revealed she had been overweight since primary school but her weight spiralled out of control after losing both her parents in her mid-20s. Now, Miss Wallace has lost more than eight stone and says slimming down hasn't only changed her life, it's saved her life. And she has been rewarded for her hard work, as she was today named Slimming World's Consultant Slimmer of the Year 2015 for the work she does to help other people to lose weight. Miss Wallace said: 'I was 26 when my dad was diagnosed with terminal bowel cancer, then a year later my mum had a heart attack and died just days later. 'My world was completely thrown upside down and food was my only comfort.' While her mother was in intensive care Georgina received some frank words from the doctor caring for her mother. She said: 'He explained that the main reason my mum was lying in that hospital bed at just 59 years old was her weight. 'He warned me that I was heavier than her and, if I carried on the way I was going, would probably not even reach her age. Those words will stay with me forever.' Georgina larked about with her cardboard cut out, throwing it the air as she was awarded her Slimmer Of The Year title . Georgina, pictured before the weight loss, piled on the pounds after both of her parents died . Georgina, pictured weighing 10 stone, now fronts her own Slimming World group, she says when she first joined she finally felt at home and was glad to find that nobody judged her . Following her mother's death, Miss Wallace nursed her father until he died 18 months later. Afterwards, with the doctor's warning still ringing in her ears, she tried slimming down and yo-yo dieted for more than seven years. While she managed to lose 7st at one point, she found the diets she followed didn't help her to change her relationship with food and she struggled to manage her weight in the long term. Name: Georgina Wallace . Age: 39 . Height: 5ft 5in/1.65m . Starting weight: 18st 3½lbs . Current weight: 10st 1½lbs . Weight loss: 8st 2lbs . Starting dress size: 28 . Current dress size: 10/12 . Date joined Slimming World: June 2010 . Date became a Slimming World Consultant: October 2013 . She finally joined Slimming World in 2010 after hearing about the club's Food Optimising eating plan from an ex-work colleague. 'We'd gone out for dinner and my friend ordered a huge plate of pasta with cheese on the top and even had a glass of wine, yet she told me she could have all of this with Slimming World and still lose weight,' she said. 'I looked up my nearest group as soon as I got home and joined the very next week. 'I was terrified of walking into a room full of strangers. I thought I'd be the biggest person there and worried everyone would judge me because of my size. 'I couldn't have been more wrong though; nobody was pointing or laughing or judging me and straightaway I felt like I was one of them. It was a magical feeling; I felt safe and I knew I belonged in that room.' Miss Wallace, who has been married to husband Mohamed for three years, began following the Food Optimising plan and discovered a love of cooking including whipping up her favourite homemade chilli con carne with rice. She also started slowly becoming more active by tracking her steps. Nowadays she walks around 20,000 steps a day including the 5km home from work and has taken up running, completing several 5km runs and one 10km run to raise money for charity. Since that first night Georgina's lost 8st 2lbs, dropping from 18st 3lbs to 10st 1lbs, and after previously wearing a dress size 28 she's now a size 10/12. Pictured before losing weight Georgina played with a dolphin while on holiday . Georgina said that she used food for comfort, saying that she would tuck in to her favourite dishes whenever she felt sad or angry . During this time she's also given up smoking. She says: 'For the first time in 30 years I am in control of my eating. 'I used to treat myself with food when I was happy and comfort myself with food when I was sad or angry. Everything I've achieved has shown me that I am a strong person and I don't need to use food as an emotional crutch anymore.' In October 2013, after losing nearly 7st, Georgina decided that she felt so passionately about the difference her own weight loss had made to her life that she wanted to help other people to slim down in the same way. She trained as a Slimming World Consultant and opened her own group in Hanworth, which she runs alongside her full-time job. Georgina started Slimming World first and then started to introduce exercise into her life, she now walks everywhere and has taken part in several runs . Miss Wallace said: 'I've been a Consultant for nearly 18 months now. Knowing that every week my members are changing their lives and I'm helping them to do that makes me so proud. 'They motivate and help me to stay on track in my own journey too, so this award is for them as well as me. 'I'm fitter and healthier – my doctor says I have 'perfect' blood pressure – than I have ever been in my life, so I always say that losing weight hasn't only changed my life it's saved my life. 'I would love to go back to the hospital and thank the doctor who looked after my mum because even though I didn't act on his words straightaway I never forgot them. 'My only regret is that my parents died before I took control of my weight, I know they'd be extremely proud of me though.' Miss Wallace's next challenge is to fulfil a lifetime ambition to scuba dive. She says: 'I have always loved the water but the fear of putting on a wet suit has always held me back. Now I've lost weight I feel like I can do anything so this is definitely top of my to-do list.' – ends – . Breakfast: .
