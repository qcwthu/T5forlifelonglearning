Murdered: Valerie Graves, 55, was killed while house-sitting in West Sussex in December 2013 . More than 2,000 men have come forward to give their DNA to eliminate themselves from the hunt for the murderer of a grandmother. Valerie Graves, 55, was killed while house-sitting over the Christmas period in 2013 and forensic experts were only able to form a limited DNA profile of the murderer from the evidence they gathered - establishing it was a man. The mass DNA screening in January and February asked all men aged over 17 who live, work or visit Bosham in West Sussex, to provide a sample and a thumbprint as part of the  investigation . Artist Ms Graves was found dead in a bedroom in Smugglers Lane, Bosham, on December 30 2013. So far 1,432 men have been eliminated from the enquiry and will receive emails or letters thanking them for providing their DNA. The village Ms Graves was murdered in - Bosham - is a favourite with ITV drama Midsomer Murders. In total, 2,042 men came forward to give samples of their DNA. Due to the volume of samples, eliminating those who have come forward can take up to two months. Detective Superintendent Nick May, of Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said: 'We want to thank all those men who attended the voluntary sessions in Bosham, Fishbourne and Chichester over the three-weeks to give their DNA. 'The response has been positive. 'The process of elimination due to the volume of samples, can take up to two months, although this can sometimes be quicker and we have already given results to more than 1,200 men. 'We expect to give more results over the coming weeks. Hunt for killer: More than 2,000 men have come forward to give their DNA to eliminate themselves from the hunt for the murderer . 'We still need those men who have not come forward to do so. 'We will be doing house-to-house enquiries and knocking on doors during a week of action from 6 to 12 April asking those who have not given their DNA to consider doing so. 'If we don't get a reply we will also be sending out further letters asking them to attend Chichester police station to give their DNA. 'We have to be tenacious in our efforts to catch the killer. 'But we do understand that this is an entirely voluntary process and there is no compulsion for anyone to co-operate with us. 'We simply want to do the best we can for Valerie's family and for the community in bringing the killer to justice.' Ms Graves, 55, was staying at the property with her sister Janet, 60, Janet's boyfriend Nigel Acres, 59, and her mother, Eileen, 87, when she was killed with a claw hammer. Cleared: So far 1,432 men have been eliminated from the enquiry after giving DNA samples . The artist - who had just moved to West Sussex from Scotland - had gone to bed at 10pm on December 29, 2013. Twelve hours later, on December 30, 2013, her sister found her dead in a ground floor bedroom at the rear of the house. A post-mortem examination revealed the grandmother had suffered significant head and facial injuries at the house in Smugglers Lane. Despite extensive investigations by police, her killer still remains at large. Forensic scientists have obtained a limited DNA profile for the murder suspect, which although not suitable for a search on the National DNA Database, indicates the suspect is male. A police officer stands outside the house where Valerie Graves was murdered on December 30 2013 . As well as being swabbed for their DNA, people volunteering also have their thumbprint and photograph taken. Detective Constable Steve Taylor from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team said: 'It is important for the public to understand that we will only use the samples obtained to check against this particular crime and their DNA profile will not appear on any database. 'Legal safeguards are in place to ensure we do not use them for any other purpose.' Anyone with information about the murder of Valerie Graves is asked to call 101 and quote Operation Ensign or to call the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.

Police are seeking an attempted murder charge against the crazed activist they say slashed the U.S ambassador to South Korea while screaming demands for Korean reunification. The attack Thursday on Mark Lippert, which prompted rival North Korea to gloat about 'knife slashes of justice,' left deep gashes and damaged tendons and nerves. It also raised questions about security in a city normally seen as ultra-safe, despite regular threats of war from Pyongyang. While an extreme example, the attack is the latest act of political violence in a deeply divided country where some protesters portray their causes as matters of life and death. Scroll down for video . On the mend: U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert appeared on Thursday wrapped in a neck bandage  after a man attacked him with a knife during a lecture in Seoul . Suspect: Police are seeking an attempted murder charge against anti-U.S. activist Kim Ki-jong (above) who they say slashed the envoy while screaming demands for Korean reunification . Lippert, 42, was recovering well but still complaining of pain in the wound on his left wrist and a finger where doctors repaired nerve damage, Severance Hospital official Yoon Do-Heum said in televised briefing. Doctors will remove the 80 stiches on Lippert's face on Monday or Tuesday and expect him to be out of the hospital by Tuesday or Wednesday. Hospital officials say he may experience sensory problems in his left hand for several months. Police, meanwhile, searched the offices of the suspect, Kim Ki-jong for documents and computer files as they investigated how the attack was planned and whether others were involved . Dumbfounded: Kim was arrested in the immediate aftermath of the attack on Lippert on Thursday morning, which left the ambassador covered in blood . In custody: The 55-year-old Kim reportedly yelled 'North Korea and South Korea should be unified' before he attacked Ambassador Lippert at the breakfast meeting. Seen above being taken into custody on Thursday . Journalists question Kim, who was brought out in a wheelchair, as he left the police station for a court in Seoul earlier today . They want to charge Kim with attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and business obstruction, and have requested a formal detention warrant. A further charge of violating South Korea's National Security Law, which bans South Koreans from publicly sympathising with the North Korean government, was being considered. But the 55-year-old has denied that he intended to kill Lippert. As part of their investigation they have also requested Kim's past travels to North Korea — seven times between 1999 and 2007 — during a previous era of inter-Korean cooperation, when Seoul was ruled by a liberal government. Kim attempted to build a memorial altar for former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il after his death in December 2011, police said. Protest: South Korean officials responded swiftly in response to the attacks, beefing up security outside the U.S. Embassy and promising justice. Above, a group of South Korean protesters burn North Korean flags in Seoul during a rally denouncing the attack on Thursday . Pro-American: While South Korea is one of America's strongest allies in Asia, there are factions of the country that are against the strong U.S. military presence. Above, more U.S.-South Korea alliance supporters pictured above on Thursday . Against the North: South Korean protesters shout slogans as they hold the photos of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, center and right, the late leaders Kim Jong Il, second from left, and Kim Il Sung, left, during a rally denouncing the attack on the U.S. ambassador on Thursday . Kim, who has a long history of anti-U.S. protests, said he acted alone in the attack on Lippert. He told police it was meant as a protest of annual U.S.-South Korean military drills that started Monday — exercises that the North has long maintained are preparations for an invasion. Kim said the drills, which Seoul and Washington say are purely defensive, ruined efforts for reconciliation between the Koreas, according to police officials. While most South Koreans look at the U.S. presence favorably, America infuriates some leftists because of its role in Korea's turbulent modern history. Washington, which backed the South during the 1950-53 Korean War against the communist North, still stations 28,500 troops here, and anti-U.S. activists see the annual military drills with Seoul as a major obstacle to their goal of a unified Korea. 'South and North Korea should be reunified,' Kim shouted as he slashed Lippert with a 10-inch knife, police and witnesses said. Right before: Lippert pictured above, seated at the breakfast table just prior to being attacked by Kim Thursday morning . Stained: Police say the ambassador was at his table and about to make a speech when Kim pushed him from behind and then started slashing him with a knife. Above, investigators survey the blood-spattered table on Thursday . Taken by surprise: Injured Ambassador Lippert is seen leaving the performing arts center where he was slashed by Kim Thursday morning . Stitched up: South Korean police stand guard outside Gangbuk Samsung hospital where Ambassador Lippert was taken after the attack on Thursday. Doctors say he needed 80 stitches for the wound on his face . South Korean protection: South Korean police patrol outside the U.S. Embassy in Seoul on March 5. The protection of foreign dignitaries and embassies is customarily the responsibility of the host country . Kim is well-known among police and activists as one of a hard-core group of protesters willing to use violence to highlight their causes. Police didn't consider the possibility that Kim, who has ties to the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation, which hosted the breakfast meeting where Lippert was attacked, would show up for the event, according to a Seoul police official who didn't want to be named, citing office rules. U.S. ambassadors have security details, but their size largely depends on the threat level of the post. Seoul is not considered to be a particularly high threat post despite its proximity to the North Korean border. It's not clear how many guards Lippert had, but they would have been fewer than the ambassadors in most of the Mideast. Outspoken: Kim Ki-jong reportedly has a history of public outbursts. Pictured above in an undated file photo from a prior protest . Seoul's Foreign Ministry said it was the first time a foreign ambassador stationed in modern South Korea had been injured in a violent attack. However, the Japanese ambassador narrowly escaped injury in 2010 when Kim threw a piece of concrete at him, according to police. Kim, who was protesting Japan's claim to small disputed islands that are occupied by South Korea, hit the ambassador's secretary instead, media reports said, and was sentenced to a three-year suspended prison term over the attack. The website of the Woorimadang activist group that Kim heads describes the group's long history of anti-U.S. protests. Photos show him and other activists rallying last week in front of the U.S. Embassy in Seoul to protest the U.S.-South Korean military drills, which are to run until the end of April. North Korea's state-controlled media crowed Thursday that Kim's 'knife slashes of justice' were 'a deserved punishment on war maniac U.S.' and reflected the South Korean people's protests against the U.S. for driving the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war because of the joint military drills. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, in Saudi Arabia for meetings with regional leaders, said the U.S. 'will never be intimidated or deterred by threats or by anybody who harms any American diplomats.' Activists in Seoul, meanwhile, expressed worries that the attack on Lippert would harm the public image of peaceful protesters, or prompt the conservative government to suppress their activities. Small to medium-sized demonstrations regularly occur across Seoul, and most are peaceful. But scuffles with police do break out occasionally, and the burning of effigies of North Korean and Japanese leaders is also common. Some demonstrators have also severed their own fingers, thrown bodily fluids at embassies and tried to self-immolate. Lippert became ambassador last October and has been a regular presence on social media and in speeches and presentations during his time in Seoul. He's regularly seen walking his Basset Hound, Grigsby, near his residence, not far from where the attack happened. His wife gave birth here and the couple gave their son a Korean middle name. While South Korea is one of the U.S.'s closest Asian allies, America has been partially blamed for the severing of Korea into two countries. In 1910, the Japanese Empire took control of unified Korea which they ruled as a colony through the end of World War II. When the Empire fell IN 1945, it was decided in a United Nations agreement that Korea be split in half at the 38th parallel. The U.S. established a trusteeship in the south while the Soviets took over in the north, leading to the creation in 1948 of two separate countries. Above, American troops board a boat bound for South Korean at the onset of the Korean War in 1950 . However, both sides thought the situation was temporary that that their respective country would ultimately become the sole head of unified Korea. Cold War tensions between the U.S. and Soviet Union only fueled these ambitions, and in 1950 the North Korean army invaded the south backed by Chinese and Soviet soldiers. While the South Koreans nearly lost the war in just the first few months of battle, the U.S. helped booster their forces and retake their land. The fighting was disasterous for both countries, which eventually agreed to an armistance in July 1953. Since the Korean War is technically ongoing, the U.S. keeps troops in South Korea at the ready. However, the strong U.S. military presence in South Korean has led to negative sentiments from some citizens who oppose reliance on the West. Still, South Korea remains one of the most pro-American populations in the world. According to a 2013 poll, 77 per cent of South Koreans surveyed said they approved of President Obama's leadership - compared to just 45 per cent of Americans at the same time.

Foreign journalists have been invited on a week-long all expenses paid trip to the Great Barrier Reef as part of the federal government's campaign to stop it being put on the United Nations 'in danger' list. The reporters, who all hail from countries on the world heritage committee, are being flown to Queensland to see the reef and learn about the government's conservation efforts, Guardian Australia reports. The trip next week, which has reportedly been organised by a Great Barrier Reef taskforce set up by the Department of Foreign Affairs, comes before a Unesco committee meeting in June where the reef's World Heritage status will be considered. Foreign journalists have been invited on a week-long all expenses paid trip to the Great Barrier Reef as part of the federal government's campaign to stop it being put on the United Nations 'in danger' list . Conservation groups have since hit out at the government saying it should spend less time showing off their efforts to journalists and more time protecting the reef. 'We want to see the reef fixed and protected,' Felicity Wishart, spokeswoman for the Australian Marine Conservation Society, told Daily Mail Australia. 'The government is spending what seems like a massive amount of money sending bureaucrats, diplomats and ministers around the world to try and avoid an 'in danger' listing. 'Now they want to bring journalists to Australia to reassure them everything is under control - it's kind of missing the point.' A spokesman for the DFAT told the Guardian diplomatic efforts, like the journalist junket, was needed to counter misinformation spread by conservationists about the reef. The reporters, who all hail from countries on the world heritage committee, are being flown to Queensland to see the reef and learn about the government's conservation efforts . 'There is currently a campaign to list the Great Barrier Reef as in danger... we think there are a number of assertions about the management of the Great Barrier Reef and its vulnerability which are not grounded in fact and which need to be rebutted,' he said. The journalists from Germany, France, the Philippines, India, Japan and Portugal will meet with scientists, the chair of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and staff from the Environment Department. Environment Minister Greg Hunt stepped up the government's campaign against an 'in danger' listing last month arguing it is the 'best managed marine ecosystem in the world'. The conservationists say they are worried the journalists will be spun misleading information and will seek to provide them another side of the story when they arrive. 'There's lots of talk and money being spent but there's no protection of the reef,' Ms Wishart said. 'This is just a spin job to international journalists about the great things they are doing.'

Two teenagers had to be rescued by firefighters on Saturday after the chuck of ice they'd foolishly stepped onto broke away from the shore and started floating out into Lake Michigan. The males, ages 17 and 18, were roughly 40 yards into the lake when the Racine Fire Department arrived to rescue them just after 12:40 p.m., reports The Journal Times. Three divers in scuba gear from the department had to swim out to rescue the pair. Scroll down for video . The two males, aged 17 and 18, had stepped onto a chuck of ice that broke away from the shore and they had to be rescued by three members of the Racine Fire Department in scuba gear . The firefighters, with help from Kenosha's Coast Guard, gave the teens life vests to put on and then pushed the chunk of ice back to shore. They then put a ladder down for the two to climb back to safety. Neither teenager was injured, reports Racine Uncovered. The incident took place at the beach behind Racine Zoo. Frequent visitors to the lake say it is currently difficult to tell where the beach ends and the ice begins. The incident is the second strange ice rescue this week - on Thursday a U.S. Coast Guard ship was cutting ice on frozen-over Lake St Clair when they came across a young man walking out on the ice alone in sub-freezing temperatures. When crew members brought the curious 25-year-old man on board, he said he was trying to walk from Detroit to Toronto. Detroit lies on the southwestern shore of Lake St Clair, and the unidentified ice-walker was found just half a mile from Seaway Island on the opposite shore. From there it's a 201-mile journey on land to reach Toronto. Snow coats Navy Pier surrounded by ice-covered Lake Michigan in Chicago. For the second consecutive winter, bitter weather threatens to turn the surface of the Great Lakes into a vast frozen plain . For the second consecutive winter, bitter weather has threatened to turn the surface of the Great Lakes into a vast, frozen plain. During February there were days when as much as 85 percent of the lakes' surface area was covered with ice, the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory has reported. Records show the lakes' most widespread freeze was 94.7 percent in 1979. The ice cover topped out at 92.2 percent last March. Significant portions of the lakes typically froze over decades ago, Leshkevich said, but the frequency of severe winters has declined since the late 1990s. 'Two almost record-setting years back to back would be very unusual,' he said. One likely explanation for the rapid buildup this month is that 2014's freeze lasted so long — Lake Superior wasn't completely ice-free until June — and summer was so mild that the lakes didn't absorb much heat, he said. 'So we started this season with below-water temperatures to begin with.' Rescued: The U.S. Coast Guard rescued a man on Thursday morning, who they found walking alone on the middle of frozen-over Lake St Clair . The ice blanket reaches across more than 90 percent of Lakes Superior, Huron and Erie, while Lakes Michigan and Ontario are more than halfway covered. It has produced some spectacular visual images, from ice caves along the Lake Michigan shoreline to a glacial buildup making it appear that Niagara Falls had frozen in place. But it's a headache for the Coast Guard, whose cutters open channels for vessels hauling vital cargo such as heating oil and road salt. The Detroit-based tug Bristol Bay has struggled for days to free the Arthur M. Anderson, a freighter stranded about 70 miles east of Cleveland in ice up to 10 feet thick. The Canadian Coast Guard has dispatched an icebreaker to assist. The job has taken so much longer than expected that the Bristol Bay's crew ran low on food and had to receive a delivery by helicopter, which lowered supplies in their rescue basket. Things will get even busier in mid-March, when the shipping season begins for the lakes' regular traffic of vessels carrying iron ore, coal, grain and other bulk cargo. 'We're probably going to be looking at situations like we had last year, where we had to put together convoys — lots of vessels together to make it through,' Coast Guard spokesman Lorne Thomas said.

All bets are off for Britons from the moment they check-in for a holiday as beach body diets go by the wayside in favour of calorific indulgence at the airport and on the plane. New research has revealed that Britons consume an average of 3,402 calories between their arrival at the airport and landing at their destination, well above the NHS's recommended daily intake. Britons overindulge more than holidaymakers from Spain, Italy, France and Germany, who were also polled, saying their holiday began long before their arrival at their chosen destination. Britons eat and drink an average of 3,402 calories at the airport and on the plane when they go on holiday . A Burger King at London Heathrow, one of more than 60 food outlets at the airport . The survey of 2,607 adults who had flown away for a holiday in the past 12 months shows the average Briton consumes between 900 and 1,400 more than health professionals say they should. The results, collated by UK flight comparison website Jetcost.co.uk, showed that the average Briton will consume 1,963 calories during this brief period in food and an additional 1,439 calories in alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks - a total of 3,402. Asked whether they felt they were over-indulging at the airport and in flight, a resounding 79 per cent said 'yes', with 53 per cent of respondents saying they were 'getting into the holiday spirit' and 28 per cent saying they 'no longer needing to diet for the holiday'. Germans come closest to Brits for pre-and-during flight consumption with a total of 3,107 calories, followed by travellers from Spain (2,350 calories), Italy (2,311 calories) and French (1,269 calories). Escalators lead up to the cafes, restaurants and bars at London Gatwick airport, a facility where travellers like to 'get into the holiday spirit' 'These numbers are astonishing, particularly when you consider the average male should consume 2,500 calories per day and the average female just 2,000,' said  Jetcost.co.uk co-founder Antoine Michelat. 'Women are almost doubling their calorie intake within a matter of hours.' Despite reaching for high-calorie treats during this brief period of their trip, Brits often save their pennies at the airport and on budget carriers that sell food. About a third of those polled (34 per cent) said they brought their own food from home with 68 per cent saying price from their main motivation, 45 per cent just want to be prepared, 42 per cent were eager not to eat into their holiday budget and 17 per cent had dietary requirements. Sandwiches (37 per cent), crisps (31 per cent) and sweets/chocolates (25 per cent) were the most popular items taken to the airport by holiday makers, not the healthiest of options. While many choose to buy food on board, 34 per cent of Brits bring their own food from home . 'We'd never recommend that anyone consume this many calories per day, let alone within such a short period of time,' added Michelat. 'Yes, we all like to have a blow out every now and then, but eating this much in one go is very bad for your waistline! This can be damaging for your health in many ways, particularly with regards to weight gain and conditions caused by weight gain. 'If you find yourself getting too carried away with food and drink, why not prepare your own food at home and limit yourself to that? If you're on a plane, there's a good chance that you're heading off on your holidays and you're about to have a period of time where you're going to overindulge for the duration, but try to think of the long term effects.'	Brits consume an average of 3,402 calories between check-in and landing . 79 per cent of survey respondents admitted they were over-indulging . German, Italian, Spanish and French travellers ranked behind Britons . 34 per cent take food from home, with sandwiches and crisps popular .
He's the son of a legendary footballer but Calum Best has become equally famous for his own love life - which is so prolific he admits to not knowing how many women he's slept with. Now ensconced in a long term relationship, the 34-year-old - who  counts Peter Stringfellow among his childhood mentors - admits he still doesn't know if he can be monogamous. In an interview with The Times, Calum paid tribute to his girlfriend of eight months, Ianthe Rose Cochrane-Stack, 24, but said that he is still aware of his own cheating 'demons'. Calum and Brtish model Ianthe Rose Cochrane-Stack have been dating since last year. Their relationship had been a secret, but was revealed after Calum starred in Celebrity Big Brother earlier this year . Promoting his new book Second Best, a heartfelt memoir of growing up feeling unloved and overshadowed by a brilliant but neglectful father, Calum insists he's trying to turn over a new leaf. After years on the party circuit in which he describes one of his lowest moments as involving 'hookers and coke', he considers himself reformed. He said: 'I sometimes think to myself, I was so driven by women and sex and naughtiness before! And now, the thought of chasing girls doesn't appeal to me.' The LA-born hunk said he despaired of meeting someone he felt comfortable sober with, admitting he didn't have 'sober sex' for several years. 'Peter Stringfellow looked after me,' says Calum of the night he was abandoned in a strip club by his father George Best. 'He took me under his wing. And he always has looked out for me, ever since' When he was growing up Calum was surrounded by stars. His mother Angie Best was a model and fitness instructor and after her marriage to George broke down she and her young son moved into Cher's guesthouse for a few years. As an adult, the handsome blonde went on to date a string of famous names himself, with ex-girlfriends including Kimberly Stewart, Lindsay Lohan, model Georgia Salpa, Girls Aloud's Sarah Harding and Elizabeth Jagger. Calum dated Bianca Gascoigne, daughter of  footballer Paul Gascoigne, after the pair met on  reality TV show Celebrity Love Island. He was also romantically involved with Jayne Middlemiss on the same TV show . After starring in a second series of Celebrity Love Island in 2007, Calum and Rebecca Loos, who claimed she had an affair with David Beckham, got very steamy on screen and were rumoured to be dating . Now he still feels unable to shake the legacy of his father, a brilliant footballer who was legendary for his drinking and womanising. Calum acknowledges in The Times: 'I know there are demons in there. I know I can go and cheat. There are some things to me that are my dad.' But he's determined to change and has voiced regrets about his behaviour with women in the past, in particular a picture that captured him making a graphic gesture with his hand in front of a woman's face which he said was very 'rude'. Calum has had a string of high-profile love interests such as Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding in 2005 (left) and another child of an icon, Mick's daughter Elizabeth Jagger (right) Calum says he resisted flirtations and come-ons from Celebrity Big Brother 2015 contestant Cami Li thanks to thoughts of his new girlfriend, model Ianthe Rose Cochrane-Stack . Calum, aged three, pictured with his mother Angie Best  and father George Best in 1984 before the couple divorced as a result of George's heavy drinking and womanising . However, the former playboy is still fending off cheating scandals and recently denied he'd had an affair with beautician Sophia Mia Wayne, 22, from Bournemouth, who claims to have hooked up with the reality TV star just 72 hours after he left the Celebrity Big Brother house last month. Calum added that during his time in the CBB house, explicit thoughts of his girlfriend were what helped him rebuff the advances of fellow contestant, glamour model Cami Li. But despite having never been in a monogamous relationship before, Calum is hopeful for his future with Ianthe Rose. 'I'll give Ianthe credit, I've never felt this strongly about anybody,' he said, and even added that after taking a recent holiday together he now feels more connected to her than ever.

Jordyn wrote the letter in January when the Wild were in the middle of a bad losing streak, KFAN reported. In the letter, Jordyn identifies herself and her father before getting to her pitch. The letter reads: 'Well, my dad is very lonely without his family. 'We are living in Minnesota right now and I am lost without my dad and so is my mom, my 2 sisters and my brother. 'It has been since November and we can not take it any more. 'To get to the point, the Wild have not been winning games and you lovely coaches are most likely mad about that but your team needs some more D men so can you please, please, please ask the Jackets if you guys can get him?!' Blue Jackets general manager Jarmo Kekalainen may have been aware of Jordyn's plight before the swap. He tweeted: 'It isn't always just about business…' After the deal was made, Fletcher of the Wild certainly found out about Jordyn's note because #TheLetter began trending on Twitter. He said the letter was 'tremendous' and 'very powerful'. Leopold has scored 67 goals and tallied 146 NHL assists. He  played for the US in the 2006 Winter Olympics .

David Moyes has threatened to find the dressing room mole at Real Sociedad and remove him from the club. The former Manchester United and Everton manager is upset that his selected 11 appeared in the media last weekend before his team’s Sunday lunchtime game against Valenica. In a press conference on Friday he said: ‘For some reason our team is in the newspapers [on the day of the game]. I don’t get the opposition team. I didn’t get Valencia’s team but the opposition get my team. I don’t think that’s right. Real Sociedad's starting XI was leaked to local media ahead of their match against Valencia . David Moyes promised to find the person responsible for the leak and remove them from the club . ‘It doesn’t seem correct to me that our rivals find about our team selection because of leaks.’ When asked if a story circulating in San Sebastian that he has warned the players that if he finds one of his team has been leaking the team to the press he will make sure they leave the club, he replied: ‘Yes, correct!’ Moyes made several changes when he arrived at the Basque club last November, reducing the number of public training sessions in the lead up to match days and limiting daily injury updates because he believes it helps inform rivals.

Mayfair on the Monopoly board may be worth only £400, but with soaring house prices the reality today is eye-wateringly different. A four-storey townhouse in the exclusive London area now sells for £40million, while even a flat in the cheapest Monopoly area of Whitechapel has gone for nearly £5million. In light of such ludicrous prices, one estate agent has now re-imagined the classic board game – set in desirable English market towns. The new Mayfair is picturesque Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire, where homes go for more than £872,000 on average. Petworth, in the South Downs National Park in West Sussex, is the second most exclusive town on the board, taking the place of Park Lane. Old Kent Road and Whitechapel Road – both worth £60 and often seen as the game’s dud streets unless you can build a hotel on them – have been replaced by Morpeth and Wooler in Northumberland, where average houses sell for about £220,000. Upmarket estate agent Savills has also reinvented Bond Street, Regent Street and Oxford Street as Harpenden, Berkhamsted, and Bushey, all in Hertfordshire, where family homes routinely sell for more than £500,000. Piccadilly, Leicester Square and Coventry Street, priced at between £260 and £280, become Salcombe in Devon, and Chipping Campden and Northleach in the Cotswolds. At the slightly cheaper end, Ilkley in West Yorkshire becomes the new Northumberland Avenue, nearby Wetherby replaces Pall Mall, and Poynton in Cheshire is £120 Pentonville Road. Lucian Cook, of Savills, said: ‘We looked for towns with the highest average value across different regions of the UK.’ The current version of Monopoly was printed by Parker Brothers in 1935, although earlier versions date back to 1904.

An undertaker in Germany passed out in shock when a coffin lid slid open and the woman inside groaned: "Where am I?" The 92-year-old lady had been pronounced dead hours earlier at a retirement home in the city of Gelsenkirchen and taken to the Munstermann funeral parlour. But when the funeral director recovered from passing out he saw the old woman lying in the coffin groaning with both eyes open. The 92-year-old lady had been pronounced dead hours earlier at a retirement home in the city of Gelsenkirchen, pictured before being taken to the  funeral parlour . An ambulance raced to the scene to take the woman back to a local hospital but she fell ill and died on Monday afternoon. A police investigation has now begun to probe how she was prounonced dead, even though she was still alive. According to reports, the woman was found in bed at the nursing home where she lived by a carer, who thought she had stopped breathing. A doctor was called and they pronounced the woman dead before she was taken away by an undertaker. A German undertaker passed out after the lid of a coffin slid open and an elderly woman inside groaned asking 'Where am I? When he realised she was still alive, he called an ambulance with paramedics noting she still had a pulse. She was rushed to hospital and her family were informed that she was still alive. The head of the retirement home where she lived, but didn't die, Lother Burger, said: 'This is terrible and inexplicable. 'We are being devoured by the press, we are being pilloried.' The investigation into the incident will decide if there had been a failure in determining a death.	A 92-year-old woman was pronounced dead at a care home in Germany .

Would you reveal your biggest regret in the name of art? A young Romanian photographer took to the streets of  the UK and Romania to find strangers brave enough to confess their deepest, darkest secrets on camera. Alecsandra Raluca Dragoi, 22, from London, captured people of all ages  in various locations  in a bid to explore ideas of human interaction and communication. A new photo project shows people holding their regrets on handwritten signs. This woman's deepest regret was when she stole her sister's money . The girl on the left wrote: 'I regret that I forgot to take my baby doll with me today' and the boy (right) wrote 'I regret I do not have more time to play' Standing straight clutching holding their signs, the unnamed subjects stare straight into the University of Portsmouth graduate's lens, allowing viewers to judge them and draw their own conclusions. While some declared they had no regrets, others were much more forthcoming in their vulnerable state. Alcohol addiction, theft and smoking weed were among the most explosive revelations from those keen to unburden themselves. A young man with a smiling toddler in a pram confessed his drinking problem while a teenage wears the ghost of a smile as she admits stealing her sister's money. A couple now living in a British seaside town said: 'Our biggest regret is that we didn't move here many years ago. WE LOVE IT HERE' These young men regret supporting Middlesbrough and smoking cannabis . A remorseful woman regretted not being able to help her child more and another wished she had different parents. There were positive messages too though, with one elderly couple expressing joy at where they live, while a little girl simply wished she had brought her doll out with her. Alecsandra said of the project: 'This question has given to me the chance to have a profound connection between me and the interlocutor, thus managing to get into their soul and bring out a grinding they have for years.' The girl on the left wrote 'Not having the confidence to be the best I can' and the girl hiding behind her sign wrote 'What I did last night' This man regrets: 'Not saying "I love you!" enough' But while many people Alecsandra asked were happy to open up about their experiences, others flatly refused. She said: 'It is true that many of the surveyed people had some abstention regarding their answers, and some of them said that it is too personal, but I had the chance to meet kind people to whom I could talk.' The project was inspired by the work of Gillian Wearing, OBE, an English conceptual artist who was part of the Young British Artists' movement in the 1990s. Wearing uses photography and video to document the confessions of ordinary people and won the Turner Prize in 1997 for her '60 Minutes Silence' and 'Sacha And Mum' videos. This woman revealed that she regretted: 'That I did not have the right parents' The man with the pram on the left confessed 'Developing an addiction to alcohol' and the man on the right wrote 'Not becoming a footballer' Alecsandra believes that her project had the power to help the people she met, by helping them to offload their burdens. She said: 'I think that frequently when you share your thought with somebody, even if it is strange person, you release the black stain which is on the soul and you can feel free. 'I do not trust in people who say that they do not have regrets. 'In my opinion, there is a difference between not having regrets and not thinking about them. 'Not thinking about regrets is better, because what you have done is in the past.' Submit your own regrets into the project here, or view the entire photo series on Alecsandra's website.

(CNN)A well-heeled employer goes back to his hotel after a hard(ish) day's work and finds no hot dinner on the table. He snaps, lashing out (allegedly) at the nearest underling who could be held responsible. Within days, almost 1 million people sign a petition for him not to lose his job, while the suspension of the TV program he presents loses the BBC 4 million viewers. Why is this man so popular that he can be accused of abusing his staff (not to mention members of other ethnic groups and nationalities) and seemingly get away with it? A serial offender, Jeremy Clarkson seems to enjoy a charmed life. But, with the BBC now deliberating over his future, has his luck finally run out? Not a chance. Clarkson, like so many celebrities, sees his stock grow with every controversy. Every indiscretion seems calculated to raise his profile and boost his esteem among his fervent followers that little bit further. The "Eeny, meeny, miny, moe" incident, which saw the N-word slip out -- whoops, did I really hear what I think I heard? -- was designed to achieve just the right effect: offensive enough to generate howls of protest, but trivial enough for his fans to spring to his defense, crying "over-reaction" and "storm in a teacup." The presenter later apologized, saying his efforts to obscure the offending word "weren't quite good enough." On this latest occasion, was it the beleaguered producer lodging a complaint, or, like any normal person who's been punched in the face by a thug, pressing charges with the local constabulary? No, it was none other than Clarkson who willingly gave himself up to the corporation. Go on, sack me, he seemed to be saying, when he told a reporter that his dismissal "is coming, isn't it?" See how my adoring public likes that. Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho are, like Clarkson, seasoned experts in rebranding themselves (or their team) as the victims, even when they seem to have everything going for them bar the position of the stars. They have all perfected the glum, hangdog expression that invites sympathy, begging forgiveness for each misdemeanour. It makes their success all the sweeter if they can convince us that they achieved it in the face of hostility. While waiting for the BBC to deliver its verdict, Clarkson penned an article for The Sun in which he likened himself to a "dinosaur" whose time is about to run out, knowing full well that his followers will protest: no, of course you're not washed up and irrelevant, Jeremy. Britain needs you to stand up to Johnny Foreigner! It is almost tempting to wonder whether there might be a political role ahead of him should the Beeb decide to give him the push for once and for all (I use the word "political" advisedly here). The Romans had a goddess, Fama, who fanfared both good and bad deeds for all eternity. Badly behaved celebrities have their trumpets blown by the massed forces of the media, which are of course only too pleased to have such good copy. Clarkson is already assured of immortality, if only through YouTube or its futuristic equivalent, but while waiting to shuffle off this mortal coil he -- like all celebrities -- acts as a conduit of divinity. He is the chain that binds the earthly audience to the goddess Fama, and this is why we allow him to act in such a beastly way, without complaining (too much). In the east of India, holy intermediaries called Kalasis beat devotees with canes. The devotees flinch with the mortal pain, but they receive it as a blessing. Contestants on the X Factor queue all night for the opportunity to be verbally abused by Simon Cowell. Bruises, actual and emotional, are worn with pride, whether delivered by the Kalasis cane, Cowell's tongue, or Clarkson's fist (allegedly). They are blessed that are touched by celebrity. So how about Oisin Tymon, Clarkson's hapless producer, who, according to the Daily Telegraph, had to seek hospital treatment for a cut lip following the "fracas?" Had he presented poor, weary Jeremy with a nice succulent steak on his arrival that evening, he would still be languishing in the realms of the unknown. And don't feel sorry for the hotel owner either: just watch bookings at Simonstone Hall, the Yorkshire hotel where the alleged incident took place, go through the roof. They may as well start engraving that blue plaque now.	Top Gear Jeremy Clarkson allegedly lashed out a producer, prompting BBC to cancel broadcast of program .

Cricketer David Warner has opened up about the emotional turmoil he feels every day as he continues to grieve over the devastating death of his friend and team mate, Phillip Hughes. Hughes was tragically killed in November 2014 in a freak accident during a Sheffield Shield match at the SCG. Warner was by Hughes' side when the 25-year-old was struck in the head by a bouncer, resulting in a catastrophic head injury. Warner, 28, desperately tried to help the young batsman, holding Hughes' hand as he was taken from the field. 'When I got home after that day I was standing in the shower and I was sort of facing the wall with my hands on my head going: “why?” His fiance, former ironwoman Falzon, described her husband-to-be as a 'warrior' on the pitch but a 'softie' at home. Falzon told 60 Minutes that Warner has been 'truly inspirational'.

Warner has opened up about how he took to the pitch again just two weeks after Hughes' funeral . Four months after Hughes' distressing death, it's clear that the memories of the fatal blow and Hughes' final days are never far from David Warner's mind. 'The thought of coming off that day (at the SCG) holding his hand was…' Warner began, fading off as he was overcome with emotion during his interview with Channel Nine's 60 Minutes. 'It hurts every day when I think about it.' Warner says that he still can't comprehend that his mate lost his life whilst playing a game. ‘It’s hard to talk about it now; It was so hard to talk about it with Candice,’ Warner told Channel 9's 60 Minutes, speaking about his fiance. ‘I turned around to Candice and said, 'Why? Why does this happen? 'Why did this happen in a game of cricket?' Warner broke down in tears during the interview as he tried to explain the pain of his grief, with his devoted fiancée Falzon by his side to offer support. Warner admits that he still battles with Hughes' death, asking: 'Why? Why does this happen? Why did this happen in a game of cricket?'

Best mates: David Warner (L) warms up pre match alongside Phillip Hughes (R) in June 2013 . Hughes was placed in an induced coma after his accident and his loved ones held a vigil at his bedside for two days, as the country prayed for a miracle that never came. Tragically Hughes died on November 26, just three days shy of his 26th birthday. Just two weeks after Hughes' funeral in his NSW hometown, Macksville, the shattered Australian cricket team travelled to Adelaide to face the unimaginable task of playing again. During the interview, Warner spoke for the first time about how it felt to step onto the pitch again so soon after Hughes' traumatic death. At a time when many doubted he could even face a ball, Warner scored an incredible 145 runs from 163 balls on the first day of the Test against India. ‘Looking into the sky, looking into the stands just brought a big smile to my face thinking “I’ve done it for him, I’ve done it for my mate,' Warner said with a smile. He looked to the sky and put his bat in the air in acknowledgement to his late friend too . A commemorative plaque to Hughes was unveiled before play began at the SCG on January 6 .

However, the hardest test was yet to come. The fourth and final Test of the series was held in Sydney, meaning Warner had to return to the SCG and play on the same pitch where his beloved 'Hughesy' was felled. 'It is still difficult returning to the SCG,' Warner admitted to 60 Minutes. 'You take each step as it comes. But it just hits you even more, the closer you get to the wicket.' That day, January 6, was not only an incredible success for David Warner but a moving tribute.

It has been a bittersweet week for Kristin Scott Thomas. On Thursday the acclaimed actress was at Buckingham Palace to receive her Damehood from the Queen, a reward for a lifetime of achievement – and almost a dress rehearsal for her new West End role playing the Monarch in The Audience. But her delight at the presentation must have involved a moment of quiet reflection, too. For last week was also the anniversary of the death of her father, taken from her in a dramatic fighter plane accident almost half a century ago on March 17, 1966. She was just five. Dame Kristin, 54 – nominated for an Oscar for her mesmerising role in The English Patient – has said little about the loss in public, but recalled that ‘Mummy was pregnant at the time and I can remember when she told us. In one breath it was, “Daddy has had an accident and won’t be coming home and I’m going to have a baby.” So it sort of took the sting out of it’. The exact details of his crash, however, have remained shrouded in secrecy – like so much else associated with the Cold War – until now, thanks to the release of a recently declassified air investigation report. Heartbreaking: Dame Kristin Scott Thomas was only five when her father was killed in a dramatic fighter plane accident . It reveals that Lieutenant Commander Simon Thomas was flying a Sea Vixen jet when it exploded after crashing into the sea off the Dorset coast. He was taking part in a training exercise for a type of mission that has since been described as ‘perhaps the most stupid, and potentially suicidal attacks ever invented’. The Sea Vixen was in the vanguard of a new generation of high-speed jets that relied on swept wings and two Rolls-Royce engines to achieve near-supersonic speed. They were designed for aircraft carriers for night-time flying and one of their tasks would be to attack Soviet ships in the event of a war. Astonishingly, of the 145 Sea Vixens built, 54 were lost in accidents and 55 crew members killed during the 13 years of frontline service with the Fleet Air Arm from 1959 to 1972. This was a worse rate of attrition than the notorious F-104 Starfighter, which became known as the ‘Widowmaker’ in Cold War West Germany because 30 per cent were lost to accidents. Lieut Cmdr Thomas, the report reveals, was the designated leader when he and three other Sea Vixen pilots lined up on the runway on the night of March 17. They were tasked with taking off from air base HMS Heron, in Yeovilton, Somerset, and attacking a target being pulled by a frigate, HMS Zulu, off Portland in Dorset. Horrific: Lieutenant Commander Simon Thomas was killed during a dangerous night-time training mission . With classic military understatement the report states that they faced ‘unpleasant conditions’, which included poor visibility, fog patches and a pitch black night. Furthermore, it was believed to have been Thomas’s first attempt at firing Glow Worm flares since he had returned to frontline duties after working as a Vixen flying instructor. The notorious flares were designed to illuminate the target prior to attack but had already been involved in a succession of accidents. As the leader, Thomas was expected to fire off the flares above the frigate so that they would illuminate the target in silhouette. The following three Sea Vixens were then tasked with attacking the dummy ship in quick succession before the leader himself would launch the final attack. All four were supposed to roll into a dive before firing off their rockets at the target at a pre-ordained angle and altitude. However, the training mission was dogged with bad luck from the outset, with one of the Sea Vixens failing to make it off the runway. The three others took off and assumed the attack formation, with Thomas in the lead, to a point 20 miles south of HMS Zulu. But then Vixen No 2 lost his radar and, after trying to maintain his position, was instructed by Thomas to return to base. This meant that No 3 assumed the No 2 position and the two remaining Vixens turned to prepare for the attack. On their first run, Thomas failed to fire the flares. Both planes turned round for a second run, but the new No 2 struggled to maintain position. By the time they were in position for a second strike, the crew of No 2 suddenly realised that HMS Zulu had changed its orientation and was now directly behind the target as they approached it. Worried their missiles could hit the frigate instead of the target it was towing, they aborted the attack for safety reasons. The report adds that the crew of No 2 heard Thomas call ‘turning in’ in preparation for his attack and ‘some five to ten seconds [later] the pilot noticed a flash’. Zulu’s crew also saw an explosion, which turned out to be Lieut Cmdr Thomas’s aircraft hitting the water and exploding. Thomas was killed instantly and his co-pilot, Lieutenant John Harvey, was listed as missing. Dame Kristin, born in Cornwall in 1960, later said that after the news of her father’s death ‘we went down to school and everybody had to be nice to us and we didn’t really understand why. Kids are so resilient. It’s only later that you realise what a terrible shock it was. I can still remember him. It’s like having a little film playing in your head. I can still remember his smell, it’s really weird. The thing that breaks my heart is the smell of engine oil’. Indeed, she has been doubly unfortunate. Kristin’s widowed mother went on to marry another Fleet Air Arm pilot, Simon Idiens, who died in another air accident in 1972. Lieutenant Commander Thomas was flying a Sea Vixen jet (pictured) when it exploded after crashing into the sea off the Dorset coast . Author Tony Buttler, in his book about the Sea Vixen, branded the Glow Worm manoeuvre, for which Lieut Cmdr Thomas was practising, ‘perhaps the most stupid, and potentially suicidal attack ever invented. Once the leader had fired the flares he had to bank left hard, climb to 4,000ft, come up behind the fourth Sea Vixen, a complex manoeuvre complicated further by the fact he had to switch on his weapons panel, which meant switching hands on the control stick, while turning his head to locate the weapons switch’. All of this was happening while the jet was maintaining a steep bank climb and the pilot was subjected to considerable G-forces. It was a recipe for disorientation and disaster. The conclusion to the MoD report offers little solace, indirectly blaming HMS Zulu and the exercise. Sir Mark Thomson, a former Sea Vixen pilot, said: ‘When you are flying at night there is no horizon. You have disorientation in relation to the ground or surface, where the ship is. You have the disorientation in relation to where the other planes are as you look in and out of the cockpit. ‘You are also looking for the weapons switch on your right side and if you are flying with your right hand you either switch hands or reach over with your left hand. ‘I can see Simon now. He was absolutely magical, the most wonderful and enchanting guy. There was no better-looking couple and while I can see Deborah in Kristin, Kristin also looks just like her father. ‘She has that classic English look with those high cheekbones. Simon and Deborah had star quality. Life can be so cruel, especially to Deborah. She even had a boyfriend between the two Simons and he was also killed in a flying accident.’	Kristin Scott Thomas's father died in a dramatic fighter plane accident .
